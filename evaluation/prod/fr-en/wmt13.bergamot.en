A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama’s Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center regards the latter as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by thunderbolt.
Indeed, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of American governments enacted new laws from 2009 onwards, making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which included 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in the year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to have a photo identification card and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as voters on polling day and deprive citizens with judicial records of their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to present a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they had sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo identification cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than 100 dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earn less than 35,000 dollars; 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to eligible voters.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have brought down the registration rate for new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the advance voting period.
For example, in Florida’s 2008 general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13 percent of the state’s voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, whites, who made up 76 percent of voters, accounted for only 46% of voters in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed, and they see it as a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: taking the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This is even more reluctant to try out men who are already reluctant to take tests.
Do you have the test or not?
We have sought the advice of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, this European study, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had screening and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not detected.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if you have a direct parent who has ever had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once you've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of cancer, by providing him with the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect life in the long term, and instead opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are detected cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to carry out active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria are being determined precisely to decide who should or should not be addressed.
So I recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one smoked any more, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a huge impact on people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after smoking is dropped, the risk of dying from cancer is half dead.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
'Research shows that regular life-long physical activity protects against colon cancer,' it adds.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Craughts, too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or beauging may result in the formation of carcinogens.
'These latest ones can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer,' it explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them was finding a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family history.
"Pay a screening test doesn't give cancer."
The hipped Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir-by stir-by last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model -- our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not yet completely safe that it's the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly certain of it.
Let's assume it's the Higgs, because the chances of getting wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law that is fatally inescapable that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule -- and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Now even if particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly consisting of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other the bosons are agitated, a dirty gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything -- at least not for that principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all exotic bugs as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's thanks to a boson of extraordinary triviality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, this "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon--and therefore one of the "force-carrier" bosons.
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except for this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond from which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometer-circumference ring - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not indeed all the particles, nor all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never stand on a fridge on its own.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while others (like the photon, here) do not.
Now, what is 'can' all this research bring, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancy between the observations and predictions of the MS.
Moreover, several of them are to be determined to find, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physical" and plug some of the Pattern holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-bops).
But there have been no such deviations at CERN until now.
Impact
The repercussions of this research in the daily life of Monsieur and Madame Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
Here: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories had no suspicion of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They came up with scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we already told the fire of the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 -- the laser was initially seen as a "lab gangget".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the search.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention at all, now serves as an "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world, and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... - The Duty
With its Commission dying with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume as a bill is being prepared.
Much remains to be done in this essential area.
The Duty tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was gnawing at him had given him a respite of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," said he, half-fig half-grape, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he said.
Disease does its work: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Atse to a appetizing lunch, he agrees to be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speak to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
"My biggest wish is that I'm cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our life, we learn that a man is pissing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she said, before accepting that she was given a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for a final visit from her son from Italy in the next few days.
At Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid are provided with a group of volunteers.
It's palliative care, which is given when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person will be accepted to provide mouth care with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help the relatives as well as the patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow one another but do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who savors his last family assembly in the yard, well held in his pillows while a 36-year-old man is dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the last six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home to their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois company and the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great lack in Quebec health care that makes several doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by luminaries of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, is circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before a willingness to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without the necessary steps to relieve her.
I fear that patients are asking to die only because they are not receiving adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are struggling with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned stressful chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I would stop fighting, she said.
Yet she had told me that I was finished.
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die thank the caregivers for not having granted their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Société de soins aux domicile du Grand Montréal, patients are refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to putting the patient to sleep until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unpaved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die. "
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want to be relieved."
The report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate sandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know about a formidable 'system', mixing the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a great deal, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took the means," said Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former Montreal chief of police.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation into the malcomes associated with the contracts for road works in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had only agreed to step back.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden funding of parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he said, "the only Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", some of them reporting their instincts to make a contribution.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he hopes that it will succeed in 'demonstrating the ploys behind individuals'.
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
More the policemen of the "Scubale" who, since 2009, have led the "cartel des sequesges" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out serial searches and charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, such as Frank zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having pocketed bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, Montreal engineers and Italian-made entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito, are formally accused.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who returned the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. It sown all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the then-Power Liberals.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts inflate the costs of
In Montreal, the corruption "system" worked well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, detailed it in front of the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he swelled.
Other road officials confessed that they had their feet greeded by swollen bills by 30% to 40 per cent by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay for deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his boxes with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a housing boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "shoots on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the wrongdoers".
The process, she says, is 'painful but positive'.
We are cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a vigil, so as not to see the doubly successful practices return.
As we clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected people who know the ploy", when they were not dying in the trick.
Believing 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but that will not change the game, according to it: "As long as we do not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of public contract award and party funding: 'We cannot go any further down; going to the heart, with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws.'
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at nothing to look in their own yard...
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona."
This season, you've gained a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress by their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements make me raise my level of play.
And in matches, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't ignite.
From my beginnings to the pre-formation centre of INF Clairefontaine to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
So a player like me wants to cope and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot to my positioning.
He is supported by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with upscale clubs.
He met great players.
I think he will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a heartwarming discussion with him.
I was then coming out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us as leader.
But we are still ambushed.
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first our chicken, in front of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th return final.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and to be sustainable.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we're really committed to pocketing this championship title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It's normal that we're expected a lot from us from what's been invested and the players we have.
It is fully accepted.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to reproach us, it's certainly a little frustrating.
One wonders what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved to be in the Champions League that we could respond present.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn't been able to qualify for the eighth final for the eighth season, they've also spent huge amounts of money.
In the light of the sums invested, we were imaginative of 15 points in advance at the truce.
It was to neglect our opponents and the French Championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can smile when we say that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of 'latan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that it is said that there is a 'latan dependency'.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and puts a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
He demonstrated wherever he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, the man and the player are respected.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This drives others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabging playing time.
I saw things there and I got out of it strengthened.
Today, I manage to make good games in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping since my baptism with the Blues.
The lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to exemplary behaviour.
How do you look at the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying for the euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will drive the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) upset on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never had such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as is often the case in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, makes up bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the BitTorrent way, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after peaking at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to two dollars, five months later, before returning today to around ten dollars (the prices are recorded on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive compared to world trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has taken an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or can be bought (and sometimes trade in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and trades.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are bankers of the books of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is in fact made between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged do exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It requires the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, as a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hash phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and single digital fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the whole.
The aim is to find the number which gives a particular imprint (many of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any change would change the fingerprint.
If, to defraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to the hundred millionth, which leaves room for ...
The difficulty of the challenge is also met at each increase in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoins in stolen repositories.
"The flaw used is not about the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Fistric actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant parses" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes a great deal in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus comes at a lower price.
The holder also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They simply have to provide an address that a telephone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
'It will take time for Bitcoin to make itself necessary, but 2013 could be a turning point,' he predicts.
Indeed, the ECB’s report plans to re-evaluate the various risks, which are now considered high, if the currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain its possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants whom we have punished by regard as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, mutilated them.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be helped when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, whom I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflowing by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surround at Kabul at the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Ancient mujahideen, the Afghan and current Taliban governments join in the desire to keep women in a inferior position.
The main probaries of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land and resale of land to build land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracts.
They discredited themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They met the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap ronits, which present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that order it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Korean commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central government.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in the state, no major irrigation systems are being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been required.
There was widespread noise that Afghanistan possessed immensely wealth in mining.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were there only to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the spot, nor of means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine in Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the vast Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also be necessary, one day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports rely heavily, to re-establish normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys' high school, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, and support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "gain hearts and minds" and to carry out the task of bringing aid and offensive actions, a civil-military "action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which was greedy in local labour, was able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave to remember, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which were very hard in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which farmers have told me, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well-controlled and directly affecting them.
A Constitution in Egypt
This is another poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play its go--all.
Taking everyone off the ground, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House another two months to finish his work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been based on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only widened the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "trail his word" and "feeling the law".
On the side of its supporters, it is ensured that it is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to abandon their plans to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, this is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while protests are raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
All the more so since this use of a hasty vote stems from the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: 'either you vote for my text, or I keep full powers', which supposedly comes to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent House, by a large Islamist majority, voted in the text yesterday.
Most liberals were missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Human rights representatives, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 replacement members were in a hurry's replacements yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Moreover, commentators had fun because one of the only differences of the day had been expressed around... the time of prayer, as some members of the committee considered that the constituent's pendulum was badly settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of the total importance of attention remains essentially the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of sharia law are the principal source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
'Hypocracy', reply the Liberals, who see it only as a coup de communication.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to Egypt scholar Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the present one.
"At the moment there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil registry.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, for some trained in the French system "temperates Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh", in particular [Islamic Jurisprudence, .
And the question might arise in the future as to what extent civilian judges are competent to pronounce themselves on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted on yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that it is significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious issue is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will the trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed concern about the text, which they deem dire freedom.
The offence of blasphemy was maintained and insult was now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, including the press.
Moreover, there is no longer any reference to women's protection, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
As the Egyptian President was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters will be marching on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the centre of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land combines greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wilderness.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five main reasons for travelling to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
A must-see rendezvous: the shores of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever penetrates these "baptismal funds" will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he appeased the storm or where fishing was miraculous.
It was in this very place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers travel through the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the courtroom), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the Burial.
It is here that the Christian centre of the world is located, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Western Wall which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC. D-C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Fortress of the Fortress, a former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC. D-C. for his family.
These ruins lie on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can go there by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which hosts many tourists in winter.
A shuttle bus can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all, the Israel Museum located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It mainly exhibits the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths consisting of castings of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and enter into total darkness.
Stars glitter.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major seaside resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can bathe in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees while the air temperature can reach 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
The azure-colored water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are surreal beauty.
We come there to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of antiquity.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his arch and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists particularly like to walk in the narrow alleys that bear the names of the zodiac's signs.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can see newlyweds coming to take photo shoots of everything from Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the Fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, because they are easily tradable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
In the case of urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
Travelling in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1 hour 30 minutes.
In Israel, Jewish tradition is intended to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport stop their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes made of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish paste, various sauces, moulded chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats that roam the hake air.
You can see them in the evening sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love passers-by places and do not refuse to be regaled.
Renting a car varies depending on the brand from 37 euros for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to 188 euros (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs 15 dollars a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entry to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
'Who language has, in Moscow goes': migrants save money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists are polibbing on what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Their only purpose is to make money to help their families who stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force stipulating that every migrant worker would have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate your language skills in Russian in order to obtain and renew its work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of an official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained teaching certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by the Act.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Russian Pushkin Institute, the People's Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to do?
What will the requirement of knowing Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service reply will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many talk about the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will make it possible to solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without occupation, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of his fellow men will torment himself for months without food and without paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, we deceive them, we take their passports, and they do not receive the planned salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Tajikistan migration service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, policeman.
However, many nationals of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia say that they do not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also that they are writing with difficulty in their own language.
It is, of course, not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, let alone dress them up properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people start earning money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the Language Act.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defence to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 rubles.
And then you can get a fake recording quickly for just 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," said journalists Umed Khushkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.
"Do fast, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers are taken from an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible simply to buy these "papers".
The authorities could give migrant workers who had not been able to validate the examination on the first occasion for taking language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether there were any shooting at weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who had killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "clamping the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net, in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon “the senseless hardening”.
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, said to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime officer for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1.168 thousand crimes were registered over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market for arms is supplied through several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking commands of weapons
The first is "military track", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that these are both stolen weapons from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from the military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often experienced explosions.
"Regement attested indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," explains the former soldier.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers have something to do with this.
"Private arms factories are not competing with international competition and are throwing weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of pistols and submachine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organises the supply," adds the former soldier.
Where do the guns come from?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from the army and the security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found "for the fault of employees whose work is linked to weapons", the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from 'clandestine slopes'.
A vendor and consultant to an armoury who asked to remain anonymous assures that no one has long bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, in his view, vendors would look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a sign, e.g. an TT pistol.
It is delivered to him by passing the goods through a wire.
"He transports her to the city and sells it for 900 dollars by the unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they are making a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun, I was given on the spot
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust them.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you have to come also by saying, for example, "On behalf of such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with a person I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it.
The newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, had not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want".
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the soldier recalls.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the seller in the forest and we install a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start to negotiate," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"Just have a specific amount of money," writes on the website "Buy a pistol or a fight machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without permit, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (stored spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow, writes "Fedorenkov" in its very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and picked up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like starving wolves and then they end up exploiting coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard of these types of schemes: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take the command.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a picture and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by making a request on the site, you can end up without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and picked up people who want to buy combat weapons.
'People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they end up mining coal in Siberia,' he says.
A Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, the experts estimate, can cost between 100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
He left the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official Ministry data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the overall number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the actual cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs fell by 7.8%.
United States: Fast Food and Supermarket Employees Strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or run out of steam quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by Walmart workers and fast food chains, the organizers of the events want to secure the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Flight", as a rain-fro rain of sales capped millions of people fell on America and sometimes unleashing sclanders.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their posts to organize pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's shops whose products are intended for low- and middle-class consumers.
Walmart markets everything: from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
On average, the products are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only in the workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products inexpensively, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" events were asking for a salary increase, and they complained that the price of the company's medical insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, this is a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost the group 3.2 billion dollars.
That's 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire increase in wages to consumers, every race in the store would go to 46 cents more.
They'll be spending in just 12.39 dollars more than now.
Walmart's supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in 8am night stores at midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items to the second.
Its coffers carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
Company spokesman Dan Fogleman told left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was just a "com" operation among many others by the organizing syndicate.
"Next customer"
Protests continued this week in New York City and no longer concerned Walmart shops (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet located there) but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you've done honestly.
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
At present, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but by a short time, on average, its core employees reach 8.90 dollars an hour in New York City.
No one touches less in this city than they are.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that sum in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live on this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least 15 dollars an hour, more than twice as much as the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing it and punishing trade union protesters with bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, getting rid of fast food is still a difficult task, and for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local Democratic policies, including that of City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: 'McDonald's advertises to sell billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly.'
Protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in sight, including candidate for mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support fast food workers to get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important featured in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast-food workers, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is currently difficult to say whether this spark of mass motion will make small ones.
"At the moment, we can only be moderately deceived the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it emerges from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the company's scientists, the glasses are already ancient years.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being at flat-screen pixels and sometimes tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What does the future also hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, so far not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of ours, in the physical world, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
To do this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding it.
In this way, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets.
- What do you think about voice control?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is a panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to inform others of one's actions or intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order aircraft in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-worn bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture and voice.
- That is to say?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can on you?
You would do so with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's going to be hard to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or may not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual rapprochement.
I believe that very soon we will have to work on new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and that's very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you not like about modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base ourselves in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to obtain about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to the latter, all current technologies are quite good, which adds work to algorithm designers.
We must bear in mind the resolution along the X- and Y axes, but also .
Speed also matters a great deal, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, gave the touch of sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 microseconds, with current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction of man and the machine.
I would very much need a device of this kind in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
- But should we not increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared emitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't showcase its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most perspective platforms?
- Of course, walking around with a smartphone with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitory" augmented reality that would allow you to switch from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Spectacles are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (the personal elements are the ones you're the only ones you're seeing) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is now accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to mere mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation.
The hands feel nothing.
What answers is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the time being, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It is perfectly recording the pressures.
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and that gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of an air blast on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Making him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still a task there that will have to be done for a long time to come: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space that he walks in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only be moderately deceived the brain, there are still many years of work.
That's what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot is still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is continuing the project "The Petersburg vanguard" dedicated to urban dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already been attended by prominent actors in the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements go beyond the city's border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in the hip festivities and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, regardless of their exhibition.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller was a prominent representative of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, philosophy and bohemian image.
- Kirill, why are you riding the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if anything that is not gray, anything that is not gray causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you understand you should be a painter?
- At the Nevskiy Palace exhibition where my work was.
I understood that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, likes, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postogurchina which gave birth to "Pushinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theater, in fashion, in music, in all kinds except words.
- And all this ended up in your Artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took a seat in Pushkinskaya-10 which housed a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Churur coming with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Chur and his friends sang easy playback songs in tight jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer, among them.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at home that he received them.
"D137" Gallery, "Gribo-edov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as a regular.
I'm a hero of the last century, from the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year," and that's when my reign ended.
It's not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I'm a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a cultural person.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a very high level of topicality and a great deal of acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it's the dress that matters, we're interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe you can't give him your hand, but we need to spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you as the Barbary organ player. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liqueur.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the silly another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov.
- It's people we've thrown at who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, less money, everything withering.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually painted at the end of our life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money for painting.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
During the reign of good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand culture well, but they understood that good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're discarded, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make their way back.
Right now, it's the "reign of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our house, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Fellowship
Diving in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a lethal asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board set off in search of a relief planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or on a relief planet?
I think there isn't much choice.
There are actually two real planets that we can conquer, if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sodine, a researcher at the P.K. State Astronomical Institute. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
Attention has begun to be given to issues of reproduction in space, focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from the Earth varieties.
Then we put insects, small breeding drosophila flies, orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an objecting embryo developed.
A completely normal chick is obtained at the outlet.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, he has to put himself on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By finding no support, the chicks agitated in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, newborns saw their instincts completely atrophying.
Chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after the quiver days.
"We looked up twice, and then we gave up, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, seeing the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.
The last biological miniature arch with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only embed species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
'These were still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. This kind of research has to be done," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats in space gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible to perform directly in space.
It's no mean feat.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of doing so, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thought, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
"No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy progeny after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbiting flights", concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Soviet Union hero and Russian hero Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Laboratory for Hydrology of the Centre for the Preparation of Cosonauts: Mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
The water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, this is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby progresses about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of its mother's belly, it is easier for the baby to get used to water.
This is in principle logical, because from birth to his first bath, there is only 2 weeks.
"That's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a nutshell, if for the child who has just been born, weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
As weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, of the pelvis, atrophy very rapidly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
You can, of course, prepare for a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"What next?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to ask to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not experience the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for workouts.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a completely dissatisfied, totally dissatisfied child", provides the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings go to their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their space-born descendants.
The head of the SAI (Higher Institution for Public Finance Control) said: "the control of pseudo-employment (in Czech 'Avarc' system) failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its application.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Institution for Supreme Audit Control in Public Finance, in an interview with Aktu-ln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
Joint monitoring by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "zvarc system" by Petr Neias.
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS is not going to bother contractors with controls; is that allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be enforced in some way, then if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries were compared.
What was specific about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation provides for the management of public procurement and specific national legislation and a practice as a follow-up to it.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have seemed to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps 'strier and better quality', nevertheless, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not sufficient to continually develop increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the very implementation of the law.
How can this project actually help you and what does this mean for you?
Such joint monitoring should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the market thresholds, this will not necessarily be achieved.
This system may be so submerged by paperwork, that those who seek it will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different way of organising it?
As far as institutions, as far as the SAI is concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised there, is also given a council that is a little differently, but these two institutions are basically proceeding in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, however, with a certain degree in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it therefore also has such courses of accounts at the level of the various federal states.
The BRH can only control federal money, which is in our country's resources.
The public funds managed at our disposal by the regions and municipalities are monitored there at the level of the Lund's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, was it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot surely be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe that's because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, which has been meant to you, as an institution, to the amendment of the Public Procurement Act, is its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out ex post-controls, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our comments relate only, for the time being, to the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for 'disaster risk of mismanagement' with which we have scrutinised almost 14 000 public contracts - this will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or an extra burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm this.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become stricter and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the audited subjects to accept that any violation of the Markets Act means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it, but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences for the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the way out?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother contractors with controls of the so-called 'varc system - what does that mean?
Is the system banned or authorized?
The law must be applied in one way or another, then if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to go and inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and allow it," but he can't say we're going to act as if nothing was happening.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be completed, precisely in order to protect tendering.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what we lack.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain workable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were runable this morning, but in frozen and also snow-covered places.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuate between -5 and -10 degrees Celsius, but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the metalliferous mountains (Krune hory) are covered by about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional road maintenance service indicate that due to fog visibility was reduced in some places.
The R6 expressway and the national roads of the region are now workable without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be observed, for example, on certain decks, the coating of which may be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class lanes, including mountain roads, are also passable.
There are still remnants of frozen snow on some of their sections and in places packed by traffic.
Especially in areas at altitude, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Krolové
The Directorate of Roads and Motorways reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice cream and that snow-packed layers of traffic can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in the high-altitude areas of the Pardubice region.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanokroun, Osto nad Orlic, Poliika, Svitavy or Vysoké M'to, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow is mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonia) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knunou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on roads in high-altitude areas.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be drier today, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3o and 1oC.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are now passable, although in some places there is a need for greater vigilance and to adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures fluctuate between -3 degrees Celsius and -9 degrees Celsius.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to pass through areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is almost smooth, but the road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between the 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in Pilsen South District and Tashov District.
The departmental and third-category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less crowded roads in the zumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to the areas of the Olomouc region at altitude are now required to count on the roads with a thick, soft snow layer.
This layer remained on the so-called "zervenohorské sedlo" collar and on the road towards Videlskak, after the chemical treatment operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance staff to the ground tonight; according to roadside services, it fell more than three centimetres in the district of zumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the roads are passable without difficulty.
"On the heights of the district of zumperk are remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jesenuk should expect to meet a thick and soft snow collar at the so-called zervenohorske sedlo' "declared the head of road maintenance services in the zumperk district to 'TK'.
Their colleagues from Jesenik district also visited the area during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, roads are runable without difficulty, however, drivers in the district of zternberk should be careful in sections in forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of Osta nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the road maintenance services of North Bohemia have reported several difficult sections.
Police data show that, in addition to some snow- or ice-covered areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knonice na Ostecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Bohemia Central Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at the present time.
Roadside maintenance units reported the presence of ice, especially in the vicinity of the town.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its training: rain and snowy during the day, clear skies and frost during the night.
From the main traffic routes, there are also reports of difficult conditions on national road 13 on the border between the regions of Osto nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knonice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of the snow until they reach the road.
Ornest said: 'Overall we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps that we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh at it and we think we're the only group that can collect a positive energy left to regrow or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you are setting up a unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
This is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost come to an end by the Maya calendar on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think that was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "Cancelled World End" (in Czech "Konec sv'a zrueno").
It's already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charity concerts as well?
Of course, everything in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
She will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point in a single live programme of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Toma Hanakk, who also played the lead role of Jesus in the music video, "Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech Biz, due to the fact that we organise numerous concerts and charity events...
We are trying to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equip the Studeo training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose construction we are working within the framework of the Jedliika Institute, with the Tap association, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit and enjoy the students of the Jedliukv Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedliika Institute, we will move this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria do you have chosen them?
We have tried to develop a programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, he will be on the stage of Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Boerta, The Tap Tap, Marion Bango and Jic Such.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other similar "mega events" in the future?
In May, we will be playing for the first time in the Prague Spring; here too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the Czech Republic's home in New York and personally, once there is a place in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of persons with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that bad that it looks at first.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs whose machines have to travel in the hold, of course we also have a lot of luggage and instrument boxes...
So far everything has gone more or less well, and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything happened without problems.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do at home, we have witnessed precisely in Moscow that it is all still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very unavailable to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it a matter of giving priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities is being created.
How do we still catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, and on this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the cutting edge of progress.
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have athletes, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what drove you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedliika Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people ready to invest in something.
And since I'm a musician myself (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Laa Angelovic says, we lost a little bit of control of the situation (Laughter).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It's true, connecting with known singers and actively working to promote the band has helped us.
We have understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in substance.
Thanks to the subsidies of the European Union, we can, in addition, allow ourselves to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to make a difference.
Show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few original projects are, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided that they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you're a demanding leader, as you're qualified by a lot of people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be intransigent in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to the rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Laa Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and leave, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled end of the world, Thursday 20 December 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-reciprocal relay when the song of The Tap Tap "Fin of the World Cancelled" is sung together.
The aim of the concert is to bring together financial resources (to the tune of CK 25 million) to equip the Studeo Multifunctional Training Centre in Prague in the Jedliika Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is CK 400, admission is free for children up to the age of 12, tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, and is the second member State of the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started working closely with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of the Agency's projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always have understanding.
I would like to refer, for example, to the A conference. At the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde book entitled "Introduction to astronauts".
The development of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold listeners, and years later Oternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Prize and André Louis Hirsch won the prize "Introduction to astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899–1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned astronautic propagator, his contribution was notably rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a raisin was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the raisin.
The only known information on this draisine was that of the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote themselves to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Institute of Technology, Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The documents kept show that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the searches stopped.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric hunting rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohoizski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended to use rocket engines as a military.
Just before the war, all plans for the use of rocket technology were carried out by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautic society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, reference is made to a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problem, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics
By that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to join the international astronautic federation (established in 1951) and by the autumn PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became vice-president of the international astronautics federation.
He retained his office until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM meteorologiczna (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version was built, RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests for the RM-2 two-stage rocket were initiated in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, was succeeded by the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Mention should also be made of the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a COSPAR national committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second non-Sovitic cosmonaut in this programme after Vladimur Remek.
The repeal of the Public Utilities Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has given rise to a strong public discussion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
In practice, this means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are in perpetual conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free (without limits) movement of private capital combined with unrestrained financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of work (wages) generate a strain on prices.
The following meaning should be put to this end: a producer shall endeavour by importing goods sold at low take to withstand economic competition by "making the price of the competitor more expensive", with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying cheaply or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no responsibility for the social point of view and thus for responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the social security contributions of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation is intensifying the perfect ill-will of the entrepreneurs, the entrepreneurs, to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is of such a common knowledge that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital generate a situation in which the Governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people with the aim of attracting foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, Governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own people economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This is achieved, on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by restricting employees' rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been years of public food distribution points for the poor who are unable to support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
As a result of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming clear that employees receive such wages, which the State is forced to pay a supplement to ensure that they reach the subsistence minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been uncovered in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economy measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with poor wages, on the fringes of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question is to be asked here: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; neither may it come, or else a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, to tire of it, that the state cannot make capital investment in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and even does not now direct, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the entire State.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, owing to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions declare, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in full sluggishness and the functions were attributed by violence.
Bronds, illegal favours, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The bribes and corruption proliferated without limits and the people were going to the elections with votes already sold"... ... ... "Fan honest people were not trying to get any job, it was the result once the state stayed 8 months without consuls." 'It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that you had to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly turned democracy into absolutist rule.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, today's society is based on the preference of personal profit, with no regard for the benefit of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and asserting the interests of society as a whole.
As before, as in the past, the result is a decadence unprecedented in elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalisation of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things stand, the demise of these systems can be seen in favour of liberal-type democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises of which we are witnessing today and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Utilities Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen State capital investment in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able to," said Sting in the song entitled Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is 'let't forget how fragile we are'.
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some took the side of Israel, citing its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others supported the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and regarding Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in his waves of recurrent killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a 'behind the curtain' perspective on the one who mainly enjoys the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small group of countries in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available under study, others emerge from my own understanding of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the story of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who was directing their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in an era of world wealth being concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be achieved in a single generation.
Among families with astronomical wealth is particularly notable for the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) to end the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most of the world’s central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of only 4 Gaddafi by 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Rothschilds Bank of America the status of a central bank and began issuing his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The aim of the First War was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, particularly British, and the third should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such as such slaves are sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, acquiring absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos – order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed intended to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those which they provoked in 1907).
After succeeding in the outbreak of World Warf by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier trigger of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they imposed far-out wages for Germany, thus generating the conditions for the radicalization of impoverished masses (there is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing to the fingers of the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia.actually) fifth columns to set fire to the gunpowder and start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the zionist movement, one of whose branches aspirated to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Sion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had held him initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel lit a fireplace that could provoke a third war.
If international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just look is how people divide bitterly between supporters and supporters of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong engenders another wrong according to a never-ending circle of violence and where there is, at the origin of everything, the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the entire world?
We must distinguish here between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like our home, international bankers only offer their own candidates to the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascinizing politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to start a war with Iran, who could, because of that country's accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of the city.destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appears from David Rockefeller's words in 1994: 'The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.'
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making it a totally controlled being.
"Let them force all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slaves to carry on the hand or forehead a red iron mark, so that it cannot buy or sell the one who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has common sense counts the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When it's all wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters of Islamist students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had been supporting his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome; it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow even later aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a shocking cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to spotted for the shooting of a great science fiction film.
Combination of genders
The exfiltration expert's plan, Tony Mendez, required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on the film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is on the one hand a realistically designed political thriller but also a "caper movie", a successful narrative, a treachery - such as, for example, in the Ocean's 11, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow one another: sequences of Tehran in the documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented with iconic photographs from the time of the events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costume men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo was his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film that is not taking place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the features that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators achieved a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake filming team in the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to settle for a subject that actually offers few thrilling scenes, in the cinematic sense of the word.
He's doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality, and there, the result isn't always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is sidelined by a phone call in America and the pursuit of the airstrip is quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events to too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, and is seen with moderate interest, enjoying the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
It trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the trick.
Rules for swelling balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has decided, now, to launch the competition for the settlement or the most absurd ideas from the "EU workshop".
'The fact that the EU is now considering adopting a quota of 40 per cent women for the management of large European companies has been at the origin of our decision,' said the survey organiser Patrik Nacher for the newspaper Prvo.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have been advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they are, objectively, less risk to insurance companies.
People can report any such incredible other idea of the 'EU workshop' until the end of the year.
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the clinging directive, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been levelled in the past against the de facto prohibition of the use of the term "buttering sound" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimetres tall.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (e.g. the Czech Republic is currently imposing demands from its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by arguing that it only harmonises non-homogeneous national standards that complicate trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that existing directives lead to a waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that a warning must appear on inflatable balloons that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to a US investigation that balloons are the leading cause of death of children by smothering.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age in blowing into fair trumpets.
We, too, have weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, anyone with an official position in the EU cannot use the name 'Macedonia' and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Republic of Macedonia).
Together with the association "Let Make" liberal economists, the bankovn-poplatky.com server named in this survey, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then went beyond, for example, the fixed volumes for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey found it interesting to pay sums of money to certain countries because they had no access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for grants.
However, these ideas do not come from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact of not having a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." In the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (SSD) was mentioned.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had ended up with full stocks which it had subsequently had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to Czech demand and called for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grant grants were offered to municipalities by the local development ministry led by Minister Pavel Noec (US-DEU), who were specifically intended to be used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: 'weird regulations are rare'.
While regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union, as well as in the area of its overall development, are more praiseworthy.
More seriously, according to experts, is the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but that have been imposed by Member States in the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions among the Czechs.
If, after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name 'Olomoucké tvarky', as far as the name 'Tuzemska rum' that goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name 'Tuzemak'.
Only products based on sugar cane alcohol, and not based on beet sugar, may bear the rum name.
The official list of registered EU products today contains, together with world-renowned cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the massepain de L'beck or Parma's ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carps of Poho-elice and T-ebo's ("Poho-elick-a-T-T------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------”).
Pardubice's gingerbread ("Pardubick'pernok") and the cakes called "Cornets de Hocia" ("ho-ické trubi-ky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we have the idea of running for a presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been plundered for the last 20 years, that thieves are not in breach and taxes are rising and the retirement age is rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to find a way to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation than standing in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate, but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your backs on those who elected you like this?
I've always said I'll go into the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected a senator, I would run for office in the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is just an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we are moaning in the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we cough those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, there is the press, which breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
It has been said, for example, that I am bribeing the journalists or that I was the counsellor of Jic Paroubek.
Let's do with your visions.
You have begun the fight for the Castle with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations as a battle horse.
To that end, you have to change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won the case.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent, member of any party, I am much more likely to gain the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without a partisan categorization and dogma, taking from each party the best for our country and implementing it.
Do you think of yourself as a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people are rather on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left-hand or right-handed, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I act just as impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get excited when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been applied by the world, and well-known experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left are slogans left.
You won't survive in politics for long with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who identifies abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the election of the president by direct vote, for example, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, inconveniently, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm trying, alone, to get things right, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run in the senatorial elections as well.
I met Radim Janaura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencova who revealed the fuel oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really dissatisfied, but now I'm hesitating.
Sixty per cent of people did not vote and most of them gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, there are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is stainless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I have only twenty thousand in my 'transparent' account.
Don't you have any money?
You talk about tax returns, what is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at around 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a zkoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who drove around, was gallant with women and fighting against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you don't have any money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
That is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the countryside.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme is not very interesting.
I don't have to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't make a living from it, for example paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not run for election.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you would put your activities muzzling on?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
However, I must live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and still winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities.

The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that real adventures are not just about imagination. To be convinced of this, you just have to look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I find this building funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a passerine on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a big neighboring company, tells us: 'Yes, it's actually fine, this building.'
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one is going his own free will in one of these rack libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that is not attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather particular record.
The municipality of 80,000 has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful little miniatures made of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
For example, the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back on statistics: the construction of a library.
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam architects MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mind-of-headed and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual phlegm and ran for the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a sneer on the face.
And as the members of the jury looked at each other again, bewildered and shrugged their shoulders, Maas, hoars him, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech backed by activist arguments by a: "common dear."
There it is, my proposal for the mountain of books by Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg.
Nine years later, the 30 million mountain sprang from land.
The building is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and adjoining houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the book mountain received the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Thus, this little dull village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a mayor's office of a mind-boggling ugly city, whose white facades invite to think that they house a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Admittedly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The extirpated glass interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lights speak unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing with balls.
And books, books and books everywhere.
'Normally, the library rays are along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,' explains Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classic spatial configuration and opened the playback spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain has been skilfully furnished: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the building's technical centre.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers do not want unknown materials.
'We wanted to work with recycled materials,' explains Joop Trouborst, project leader of the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
For example, one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, a one-millimetre-thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, the literary café offers us a stunning view of the city, but also of Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute above all to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
'It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,' says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below a bell of glass, the sun only lights the interior for a short time, even on fine days.
The thick wooden beams crossed with respect to the glass facade serve as sun visors, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the gaps of the library which was not yet completely furnished (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all directions.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
Thus, MVRDV has reached the main discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may look young and undied.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian demand for observer state status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but it was not too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Is Germany having difficulty in taking a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from an American-defined policy and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore clashed with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still groping to find this role, but they are on the road to a 'more normal' foreign policy.
An external policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term 'normal' foreign policy mean for the Germans in practice?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, and therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstention from the UN vote?
First of all, Germany has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a determining factor.
However, I would not give too much importance to this, because this is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Is Germany harming its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are diverse views on the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overwhelmed with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Is Germany having difficulties in reconciling its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I think it doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are doing now in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume a leading role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been a delicate issue.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware that they must play a more independent role.
Is Germany being a major player on the international stage, does Germany want to take on a key role?
Or does it still find it difficult to assume leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, and this is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulty playing a more important role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, there are many anti-German sentiments that are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with a wide range of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this gap, so who is it still?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they're all less appreciated, it's life.

"Marblemark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking which bears its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not certain that she would win.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing in violation of property rights in the Far East.

Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opened a binder in which the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office were located.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the trade mark 'egna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, the Pattloch cases are different: its constituents instruct it to tackle the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to reproach themselves with.
'It's bad for business, we have to fight against this trend,' Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
The financial and legal costs amount to the sectors concerned in millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China accounts for the third fastest growing and fastest growing market of EUR 15 billion in the world.
However, it is not easy to write off dubious registrations from the trade mark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch referred to the lawsuits in which the court dismissed the complaint, as after a long period of time the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch tells us that if the plaintiff is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay the money to the plagiarist, because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, Volvo's acquisition, used a blue and white logo that was reminiscent of BMW's. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to the plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile's eyes in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brands office in Beijing admits, however, to have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office had moved last year from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a restored normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases would have been closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Action is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top of the list for the number of new deposits in the world for the tenth consecutive time.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each registration earned an average of 1.280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to ensure that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain his Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
'It's our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,' explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munich objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case in the next two instances, but the other side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler was confident, he believed in a positive outcome of the trial and praised the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: 'the procedure is long, stressful and costs us a lot of time and money.'
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The Archives Service had even had to review the proceedings of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even unsuccessfully proposed to the opposing party a "big sum in six-digit euro" to settle the dispute.
'That's what it means to us,' says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East are even threatening to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a footwear and leather company.
The company had long since abandoned the sector, but it had still been able to prevent the deposition.
Wentzler added: 'vigilance is in order'.
Pattloch and advise him that German companies exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It was not enough, in their view, to rely on international trade mark law; rather, foreigners should "register in China also anything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay licence fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeated in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice at their arrival.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than an 8.733 kilometer distance.
First of all, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, checker pumps for ladies and moccasins for men seek rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the singers' voices grow slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they get carried away, bewitch and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost lost his canvas shoes when he conducted the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came from the geneticist in human medicine to the man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every chorister has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Assisting in helping one another
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide have the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 infected persons in Swaziland.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through the association "Voices for Africa".
Of these, 70 attend secondary schools.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, one can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal at the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in zulu "same of stories" or "monetary singer".
No one can be fluent in the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany and now returns it to its home region: the South of Africa.
At 8.733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or land huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, the disease that plagues Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF can be seen on a smaller scale.
The population hardly ever accepts male circumcision, a measure that ensures a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population is infected with immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-1990s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. Above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
Initially, they were only a few people who personally undertook to pay a few euros every year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been almost professionally involved in Esitjeni's AIDS orphans.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydies and gonorrhoea (or gonorrhoea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydie-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamyd infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are for young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papilloma virus in Germany is common among young people.
How many infections affect?
It is not compulsory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and the appearance of spots and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100 per cent.
This is because pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricant infection or close body contact.
Experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes sexual partners regularly undergo regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that singers are raising thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the resources are accumulating.
'In all, we have already sent around EUR 200,000 to Esitjeni,' said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, a self-confident woman, who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers'.
Gogos, which are called old women in zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them cater for up to 14 orphans, provide them with a roof over their homes and ensure that they visit their uniforms every day on time.
The orphan who no one has stopped being taken to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school and allowed the construction of two henhouses. With the support of the US health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many people.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
One King and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a topic that touches sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These State-sanctioned morals, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also disseminated the virus throughout the country.
Condoms are found at every street corner, Annette Lennartz adds, "but hardly anyone uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi's singers travel together every two or three years in the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many of the inhabitants of the forefront of the black continent still experience in the apartheid period.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition as it not only generates good humour and joy, but sometimes tears a tear from some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find light there," said the people there.
And after an 8.733 kilometer trip as a crow flies, back to Heidelberg, in front of those choristers who are kicking in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Strasse, there is also light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice could be as much as 20 meters thick.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained in three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres of up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps an asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other elements essential to life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered the region where stars are born, dubbed "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope has photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a star dying.
The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, clusters of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope enhances the colors.
In this infrared photo, the Propeller Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblance to a land-continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular tint.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the tint, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the glowing heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname "Southern Fire Wheel."
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of grains of dust that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual household dust.
This photo was produced from optical and X-ray clichés taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives rise to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also permanently create young stars at 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced with a small black hole, there is not yet any dust, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have continued to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see further and further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes it possible to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa was segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The drawback of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity lies in its great light-collecting capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is similar to those of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach an impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A gigantic new telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been giving us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1.235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data had been indicative of the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
With the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain of this.
Drink butter daily, and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

A survey of a country, where you are still relatively young at 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is a hilly romanticism.
At the turn of the many turning points of the road, the small bus cahats along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost feels like the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small square town with its overly aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not fit at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be here the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum in this way in the world.
The lives of about eight dozen Talysh in the region can be discovered, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white picture.
This is my grandfather, he's reached the age of 120.
Still having a child at the age of 136
But the museum's controversial star is the city of zirali M. M.mov.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of Muslumov seems more than dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man is said to have married three times and he is said to have had 23 children. By the age of 136, he would still have designed a girl.
Would he have been mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the man in the old age of Central Asia.
"Susurprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men living incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil register.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is, however, in fact that the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that Talysh's high-calorie meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she was still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor next to a churn, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children also frolic in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of a stomach.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost it and they've kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the lead.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-gray son is right: 'the elders enjoy great respect in our culture'.
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country's deep divide.
The draft constitution based on sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian President is not stingy with words full of emotions.
We must make the transition a success.
'And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,' he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but also especially to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a Nile theocracy in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, temporarily narrowing the powers of the Constitutional Court and enlarging his "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, does not really know what it wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written hastily by the predominantly Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour nightstroke are indeed worrisome to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal room for manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, an article introduced to suggest that, in all matters relating to sharia law, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The school is the largest Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean, that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to the placing of the judiciary under guardianship.
Many points in the draft Constitution are relevant to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to repress opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The draft should also be noted that the State should protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
To put it plainly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is prohibited to "offensive people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature from the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore open to interpretation in the draft which Morsi is putting to the vote and which, in his own words, will be 'very soon' the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution was up"
The opposition has been rallying for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down sharia law before it came into force.
"The revolution is resurrecting and we will win", says Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, said that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and we will overthrow it," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet uponon," Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, said according to Egyptian media reports.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would mean that it would be null and void.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was held in front of Cairo University.
Veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people demand the application of God's law."
"Clean our country," they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Koran is their Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that is what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents of the draft Constitution, like its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
In their view, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballots of the direction that the country should take.
The Islamists’ plan will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have continued until February and encompass all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their worldview, but because for him human rights were indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he said in his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatantly damaging the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto deprives it of all its powers", Saeda deplores.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the Nile River with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid for.
A protester in the Tharir Square warns: "You give birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the locals' appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the landscape is spectacular -- and this smell, omnipresent, pervades the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can be up to a year old.
When the darkness sets in and it is cold, the Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter who is also known as 'Rakfisk General', responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of beverage.
'Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,' adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it's not bad - it's reminiscent of sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in air-tight water barrels and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once fermented well, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so richer until long ago, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit scenting, part of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 dollars each.
Norway does not often make a fuss about it in international news, which is not to be displeased.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who shot and killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they refer to this killing, they talk about the "migration of 22 July".
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of them could have committed such an act of barbarity.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
'But oil is not the only reason why we succeed,' explains Anna, our waitress, with a blonde hair and in the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic welfare, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are - how do you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to get noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything except a small percentage of oil from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out of the window, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has been able to keep its purse strings tight.
'As long as you can ski in winter and go hiking in the summer, we are happy,' says Anna.
'Without forgetting the rakfisk,' she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and line up to buy food - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I'm staying in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them -- or perhaps for the most odorant of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It feels like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here's our dots, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the smoke emanating.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is making a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his duties in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where congestion is normally legion, a safety barrage has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the nation’s new president.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, results for outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before rubbing shoulders with the President of the United States, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A densely densely and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On his favourite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plates bearing its name are attached to the outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for much-needed real change.
After 81 years of powerlessness, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected critics of the opponents who blame the new president for running out of charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of their former governor's people.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under the motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military had been called to the rescue to combat drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a disaster area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found at the landfill edge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best he failed to stem the problem of murders against women while in office.
At worst, they accuse its administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I got home, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and cadaverical rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross featuring the word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whining machine.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
'But it is not right that there are so many irregularities and omissions,' she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised that he will make his priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be as good as president as he was when he was governor," Congressman Olvera told Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected during his detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was carried out under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the greatest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claimed to have been subjected in his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
Cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring the Manning case to be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping was in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- occurred a day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At Friday's hearing, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers posed questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that his custody's treatment was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not file any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems raised.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing the concerns), and however, this did not mean that I hadn't raised any problems,' said Manning.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in a January 2011 interview with the special committee that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned it this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for its protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was doing well, and I wanted to have this status removed from me... in order to get a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Marine Corps base military prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and fainting once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that the failure to have been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once on Quantico, Manning said that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 9 p.m. and sometimes over 23 hours -- without a company.
Manning also added that the only items available to him were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also clarified that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked overnight in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with cover during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from his guard order that he had to drop his cover that might have concealed his nakedness, but admitted that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic band of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year.
The defence stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious offences and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all counts are charged, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remind the Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarette says that Mexican Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration authorities, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two tracks: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicains"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line I was to go.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the Mexican all my life.
It is an ethnic adjective, just as the one that my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York City when they call themselves "Italians."
Then I became "Mexico American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And on the earth that saw my grandfather be born, there is no need for a special adjective or a hyphen.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an indigenous person, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and went to the "Foreigners" line.
I thought at that point of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than venture into the United States.
He wanted to ally himself with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the lines of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is pmalting the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory to the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
So, as soon as a U.S. official criticizes Mexico, you start to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans undermine their neighbor's sovereignty.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million American Mexico Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to talk about bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason why the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, maybe a relative or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person matched a typical profile -- dark, unheeded skin, from a poor village, and so on.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are living in the American dream right now, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that this is the American dream that we live in, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with it in the United States.
On the other hand, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they tolerate us as if we were individuals of inferior and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't find ourselves stuck on the bright side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, because Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and the American Mexicoers are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels that she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many American-Americans I know do not feel like they belong to one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want American-American Mexicoers to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That will not happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to fend for yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still resent them of the way in which their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old quarrels, the new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed suggests that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments remain for who began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in a state of flux.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little further.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire on 21 November continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has been beaten with a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and driven the 1.7 million people from Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, with the other part of Palestine currently being at the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made itself rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken on the cause of Hamas; just as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the Islamist growing is bend around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where Hezbollah’s militia is wminating through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on Israel’s southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the region’s balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more easily relied on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hardline line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The missile interception system dubbed Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being behind the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who completely ignored the peace process.
Although rocket attacks from Gaza had killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel had been spared suicide bombings, including the separation barrier that encroached on the West Bank, the main weapon of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protected Jewish settlements that continued to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election of 22 January, has the good side.
Why pamper these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were to rule the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out with their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but the Arab Spring may make a difference.
Even if Islamists in power in Egypt and elsewhere dislike Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel -- much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable persons on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A small and short-term hope is that the ceasefire will give outsiders the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the circulation of arms to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian State than the forthcoming proposal for a pseudo-state of the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packets have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packets that are all the same, regardless of brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colours have been replaced by dark olive green and horrendous photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents's smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packets, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packets.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government has stated that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by suppressing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they're never starting.
'Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,' said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown with a logo to a princess.'
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied the law.
Tobacco manufacturers have said that this would boost the black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
'Harmful consequences will flow from this legislation,' said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers from China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that the Act had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of 'ico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, stated that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrendous packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the Australian High Court.
Ha stated that zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the target segment of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertisements, sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local businesses and websites, but cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
'If you work in tobacco marketing and you now have only a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the top-notch place,' said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being considered in England, New zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you put the packet," said Victor El Hage when he bought a packet featuring a picture of the mouth's tumor.
To be frank, the only reason I'm arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that uniformity of packaging made it difficult to store packs on the displays.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and we're locking them in the door," he added, raising arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to think about the subject of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to entertain you (not to mention duty-free shops).
Increasingly, however, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
'The boredom goes back a long way,' he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After browsing extensively published and submitting the idea to a panel of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experiment that "wants to do something, but without succeeding in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like to do so.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, combined with a sullen mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be connected, bored people tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which participants listened on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some bands heard, from the next hall, the too high sound of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or engaging task, a discontinuation of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like watching objects on an editing line, music can help you not bore you."
In fact, he says, now we know that when we twist or scribble, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
'Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigter learn more and learn more information than those who are forced to stay without change,' said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another -- the delay in my plane flight, a speaker with a monochord voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a 'Predisposition to boredom' scale in the 1980s.
The ladder includes claims like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonic," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, including need for many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasé.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I repeat my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes it does not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Bount is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what's the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, that'll make you happy.
But if you look at TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long run.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't have learned to look after himself or to self-tilge, says Professor Fenske.
And 'this self-regulation is moving from one situation to another,' he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I also do not think that we should criticise him.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should aim at.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this.
'We need to get bored more often, but the trouble arouses an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,' he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
'In an environment where we're constantly hyperstimulated,' he added, 'it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.'
In Colorado, no directive for the new Marijuana Act
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day in September, he and some friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for its use - minor offences, each with a fine of 100 euros - and a date of appearance.
'We are treated as criminals,' said Mr. Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than law.
Here and in Washington, D.C., which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been categorized.
The police have stopped charging adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for the acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own it.
At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales businesses in their neighborhoods.
'Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us,' said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking quite a few questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states of regulation of marijuana, first of all about therapeutic use and now regarding personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can only do more than suggest what works.
'There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves,' he said.
Washington's law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain outstanding: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis businesses within a 30 km radius of a school, park, playground or crèche.
'There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis business, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,' said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently formed Research Group, a research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons aged 21 and over who possessed small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging persons for this type of "immediate effect".
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement new court decisions that regulate the work of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "Acquiriter of the Republic" (Aknowsarco) (Aknows of the Republic), Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, mainly in order to put pressure on users to be detoxified.
Currently, 119 persons are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are subject to other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute those persons who committed an offence which, at the time of the events, was a recognized offence", said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana use.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer bring adults to possession of small quantities.
The county prosecutor's representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to file all marijuana detention cases without further action.
'I don't feel like I'm wasting my time of keeping the law running until it changes,' he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana consumption is not an easy task.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the Public Prosecutor's Office, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents those accused of marijuana consumption and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent a good part of their lives suing people who were consuming marijuana, so they find it difficult to accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington State are poised to become a case law for drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are planning a new frontier of legalized sales, they await with concern the federal government's directives, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give way.
Despite some high-profile arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has mostly allowed the therapeutic marijuana sales businesses to practice in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are unlikely to push the doors into small bags of drugs, it is likely that they are opposed to licensed sales of marijuana for personal use authorized under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoria on the establishment of new marijuana sales businesses, even if it is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose was granted a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than on the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not just today's students who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and elder brother studied in what I was a prominent place to know, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after moving to Worcester College in the late '80s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected that undergraduate students had sex in the bedroom next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said facely that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled, because I had been bullied and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather out of my name, or because I was from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of center-rights students suffers the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Hall (JCR) at Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They wanted there to be a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views could be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC documentary Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on student politics, which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
In particular, there was a student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silvery suit and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as scapegoats for setting up the tuition increase."
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing leftist bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even having met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says that such an climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, President of the OUCA, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right.
'This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members,' she said.
I was the only one to think like this in my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered September 1986, when I was 18 years old and shylysis.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found out that professors not only participated in sarcasms to Tory students, but that in addition, they enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on the strikers, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was a victim of was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pussy face, would get angry easily.
"Dothes of the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your spare time - well, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a snarling tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student of English, named James, who ran as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that this is the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (labour).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This ploy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economics who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city family and friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bell towers.
Even my communist friends had impeccable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, too Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
In a work session the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Roaring inwardly shameful, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and calling them "old mad."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who broke down the last nail of my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I lay in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a wet hen crying.
However, no child under the age of 18 should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also has an unshakeable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian fashion designer customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The fashion designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: A Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high fashion models created for his fashion house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "he ignores" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Mary Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent: from the modest fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
'At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do,' says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of the beauties of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also did not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Several years ago, after a parade in the Spanish Square, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One could see and feel his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, in food, in music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go through fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Line of nobility parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He likes well-raised people and with the biggest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters wide which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to parade on the podium to admire a "dour" of dreams bearing the main creations of Valentino, like the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica carried withOfficer Farah Diba.
This modeling audience includes names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a gillette jacket and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the fashion designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all the others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," adds the former Feeling of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot either forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being old and an opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a neckline to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the dresser's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, she is also the whole of the memories she conveys".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition was the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller worn at her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the fashion designer thus calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of high society".
Obsubiled for years by the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani combines as many honours as any husband of her clients.
'His refinement, its calm, its neat and perfect appearance have always jumped out to me,' says Arenberg.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If it is a princess who says so...
The world's toughest profession: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano wearers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilograms of sulphur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by carrying the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work daily to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur dioxide from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, which weigh nearly 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that rises to 2.386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle-like appearance, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur extracted.
Once up, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has set up a little below at 1.850 meters.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry of 10,000 (83 euro cents) since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleach sugar.
'As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about Rs. 46,000 (3.8 euros) for each trip,' explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and he finishes exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would gain in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid for 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.220) per day and where the average monthly wage is 2 million rupees (EUR 167)", says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.20) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto came back near his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as indisputable as the sulphur: 'I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her back to Java to Java.'
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to charge him for the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, cough constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Muded by life, this friendly and intelligent young person could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unsanitary wooden masure with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop gushing out at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers charge the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who are self-employed and weighed.
Moreover, they also do not receive a price mark below 30,000 (EUR 2.50) of camera increase, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.220 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent wearer who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left middle school.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilograms, he assured that he would not stop working "as long as he could", as he needed money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, artthrosses, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, can only charge 50 kilograms.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a weed-infested goat trail.
"I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, unveiling several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: that made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children for career, stress and the cost of home ownership.
"The people of Singapore must develop".
I'm a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, let's do our civic duty and give life.
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polchinelle in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertisement.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfil "their national duty".
It's only for the Internet, so we were able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in that country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth rates, so we felt that this was something we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromone fragrances or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought the following: What's more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
Singapore's government does not take it as much lightly.
It spends USD 1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state of Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the turnover rate, was in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said it was due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
'This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marriage and family building,' she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counter the shrinking population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of earning wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unintended consequences.
The government tried to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to reach the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoebox", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and are very successful in selling.
However, the authorities were concerned that they could promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, says its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it's much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously sidebreaking if they wished to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it would seem that they would not have much effect.
'People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it off to a later,' says a young executive.
Other persons may have children.
"But for me it's important to be able to have my money and my time," said another young man in his twenties.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of home ownership and education as well as reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the field of private life that we can protect from intrusion".
What is private for children under the age of 16?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does it understand the dangers to which it is exposed by broadcasting on the Internet events that it would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeridico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" and "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I won't reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
'These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone,' he says.
On FB, I post cool pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would be foolish," he said.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends, quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his friends list.
'It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example,' he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or telephone number.
'If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would just delete them from my account,' he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not unrelated to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was incarcerated on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only put it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young person would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
'Even though I know it's cyberbullying,' he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
'The Internet has emerged as a way to look for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,' she says.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people who were born with technology.
'We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,' she says.
He added that the topic was complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, to publish or say at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents confidentiality is to use questions that make them think.
'To say nothing is about not doing it,' she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like a friend you've published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you pick up party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online the way they do offline.
These are the same rules.
'Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks,' she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary schoolteacher and education counsellor, said that it was essential for parents to conscientiously read the conditions for using social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
'For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,' he says.
According to Guardia, it was essential to remind children that foreigners should not be talked to.
The Unasur Summit ended without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the declaration of the Lima Declaration, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven trustees present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Unasur Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the conclusion of the summit, and then claimed that it would be published from one time to the other on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been explained by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly restricted.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information circulating among journalists was that given by the press officers of some of the Unasur Governments that were present at the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document leaked during the day was a list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were asking for more information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this was the speech by President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit in South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was widely requested by the press, it had also not issued the so-called Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it is possible to verify that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the availability of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that rules a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piaera, met at the regional meeting and said that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in Lima's lawsuit against Santiago, which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the differences we are holding today before this international court", said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," added President Piaera, giving President Humala a handshake, alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011, after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host Chairman, Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the proceedings in the morning and to close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The trustee read the outcome document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total investment of 17 million dollars.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important approaches to achieving the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that action would be taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organised crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the Internet at low cost throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people", concluded President Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic channels," the Peruvian President said in a speech.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the cross-sections of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide further details.
Similarly, the outcome document refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow it to be reintegrated into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through an ICJ ruling requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to revise all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua which will ask for a discussion with this country", he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are going to sort this out in the most civilised and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to witness the seizure of power by the country's new president, Enrique Peia Nieto.
Similarly, within the framework of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers will meet beforehand to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which attempts to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
'South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,' says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today said that creating a common citizenship is an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State TV, TV Peru, that Europeans "were killed in World War II" and other conflicts, "but they are now almost a homeland".
In this regard, he advocated for the establishment of South American citizenship promoted by Unasur member countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador was in favour of rebuilding the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who repress our ears never compromise each other, but we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to Ecuador's political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary has respected his 'deep democratic and human rights values'.
He concluded that at the time "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish judiciary, which demanded that he submit to an interrogation concerning an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to her since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the President of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health will deteriorate by being enclosed in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
'It affects the health of anyone,' he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and he stressed that he had had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the WikiLeak founder.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
'The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, has launched a whole series of proceedings with various European bodies,' he said.
And he thinks that 'if Britain gave the safe-duct tomorrow, it would end'.
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or interrogated him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he could not tolerate was "medicated, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
'The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,' he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that it was not such journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than put forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate disguised expediency and coup d'état attempts", because in reality "this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as "completely relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgement is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They must be resolved as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed his confidence in the successful resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same tribunal and stated that it was "beneficial that Latin America should seize international bodies if both countries agree to a judgement so firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that, if he lost the primaries in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can be resolved only through political power.
'My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility,' he said.
If I won, this would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will do it too.
'This is my decision,' he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just discussed with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment is already planned and that he is waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chavez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VIth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
'It's as if the sky had fallen on my head,' he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make 'less painful', in vain.
The young man hid him from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about him and his zeal was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes it as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectiologist and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of assignment of the immune system that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 cell count of up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that for someone who gets a positive HIV diagnosis at 25, "as long as he remains under control, can live without problems until the age of 75," explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to place this progress in context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS increased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients on the basis of national data have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I do not think the problem is concerned about access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over at least the last 12 years, we have never run out of medication, the problem is that patients are reaching very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact: "nine in ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, to do so, we must propose massive screening tests, to all the people who request it".
The specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to test his screening in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better for me to have fun three times a week," they say, "is not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, through his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
If they take the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, 'we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, that is all very well, but as a result, as yet today, some do not have access to condoms,' he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", raised with sarcasm and value judgements by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposed to redirect that inefficient distribution; that condoms should not only be sold at counters, but should be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It is not a question of encouraging promiscuity.
It was also not a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when he had been asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
'It's not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,' he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the fourth largest country in the country in terms of the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and the 13th largest number of HIV-infected patients.
92% of the infections are carried out sexually, 6% by the blood route and 2% by the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for each case registered there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario sets a bad precedent for all national companies with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore appears that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country with a star-tank banner, against international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the June 15, judgement of Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the North District of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to refer the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case reports that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal asserts that the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would imply denunciation of cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of Commercial Law International had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that, without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical estate of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by subsidiaries of Vitro towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of Commercial Banks guaranteed the debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in every way the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vorur" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote was 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the time being, the company of the Gonzalez Sada family will appeal to the same appellate court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will demand non-prosperity and requires the review of the case by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, pointing out that this freed it from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guaranteed fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carhy: they stun a Vitro and they stun the country.
Overall stocktaking
The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Society of Aviation against the former boss of the company, Gaston Azcoraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos D'az Chavez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Bank and Values Commission, which is accused of obstructing the courts.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney-General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw the F/589 trust from the IXE Bank of 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviacion.
The funds were reportedly used for the purchase of shares in the Hotel Professional Administration.
As is well known, Azcorga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They besieged the Dragon Mart
Meeting at the weekend in an amphitheatre of the Caribbean University, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front opposing the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the south-eastern zone in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly in protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a demand of the Senate to explain the terms and circumstances of the Mexican Ambassador to Japan that the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym for ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property, this is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, this was done despite the fact that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the real estate developer Homex entered the stock exchange market for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The basketball globetrotrocharger "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as big as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral hemorrhage doomed him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamon Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I wore several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he resided with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories reminiscent of his extraordinary itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or team manager.
"It was my best years, the years I took most advantage of because I had the chance to compete in eight championships of the Vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It's been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired to the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said, "I have a tough player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
That's how Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players, started.
Bartow then recommended to me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He rejoiced in the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's responsibilities in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States in the 1989 pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game again, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the Pan American Cuba Games in 1991, when we won gold and we beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also the young people (Javier) "Tozito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 due to a problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the Imbroglio of the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, this is Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level, as Piculon did.
This is without taking into account his trajectory in the various leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having was one of the most glorious times on the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, that Ponce's boys play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of compulsory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I take advantage of the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died of cancer complications on Friday night, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most," said the family.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and had admitted to having drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become known on television as an ordinary guy in the NBC series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critical roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully abhorrent J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the Hagman character is almost murdered, generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode in November 1980, 41 million viewers averaged their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-in-in-sister (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had put her to pregnant and subsequently threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to internalize his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
We should write: "The honest citizen J.R. "Ewing".
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled on Friday from Hangman as a "big man, both on the small screen and in life".
It's unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already over for the second season and a sixth is in the process of being made, the channel informed.
So far, neither Warner nor the TNT has communicated how Hangman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who enjoyed celebrity with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the stages of New York Theatres in the early 1950s and then served in the 1952–1956 air force in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian town of Malibu, where many celebrities resided.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (Hello Darlin': The Circumsons of J.R.)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come to have surgery and afterwards," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them a little bit of comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it's going to be fine."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religious teacher Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook there: the end of the "big count" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the impending world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some dubbed the "Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-time Christian theorists thought that the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever seen," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we have to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher giving classes on the "end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
'We analyse this because these ideas proliferate over time,' he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human course.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyse films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
'I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,' said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a lecture, simply entitled "The End of the World".
'We're adding '2012' to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear,' said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and take their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be held the day before the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
'It was complete in two hours,' said Restall about his course for top students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinated me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, University of Rutgers-Camden.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and infirmary, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
'I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,' he said.
I like it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us that we believe in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and somehow we discredited it," says Julie Egle, a senior-year student at Temple, a 21-year-old student from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it's just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is anxiety about the apocalypse in Western culture, going back several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused this speculation to flourish.
'In other parts of the world, people don't think about that,' he says.
The majority of these are the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were giving classes here about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we've talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several have told us that they are thinking of going to 'end of the world's holidays.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at them together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
