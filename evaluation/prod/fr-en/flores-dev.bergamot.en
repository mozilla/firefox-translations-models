The former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, came in second place with 32%.
As a state in which the winner wins everything, Florida awarded Romney its fifty delegates, pushing him to the top of the list for the Republican Party nomination.
The organisers of the event claimed that around 100 000 people came to several German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
In Berlin, the police estimate that there were about 6,500 demonstrators.
Demonstrations were also held in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, about 200 people demonstrated in front of the offices of some major copyright holders.
Last month, there were large demonstrations in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which decided the Polish Government not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have delayed the accession process to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA Chief Inspector David O’Shannessy told ABC that the surveillance and inspection of slaughterhouses should be obvious in Australia.
“Video surveillance would certainly send a strong message to people working with animals that their well-being is of the utmost importance.”
According to data from the United States Institute of Geological Survey’s International Earthquake Map, no earthquakes had occurred in Iceland in the previous week.
Moreover, according to the Icelandic meteorological bureau, the Hekla region has not experienced an earthquake in the last 48 hours.
The major earthquake that led to the phase change occurred on 10 March on the north-eastern face of the volcano summit caldera.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity have been reported to the base of the mountain.
The clouds were at risk of confusion as to whether a real eruption had occurred.
The Luno had 120–160 cubic metres of fuel on board when it broke down, while strong winds and waves pushed it into the breakwater.
Helicopters rescued all twelve crew members and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre ship was on its way to recover its usual cargo of fertilizer, and the authorities initially feared that it would dump its fuel into the sea.
The proposed amendment was already adopted by both chambers in 2011.
A change was made during this legislative session when the second proposal was first deleted by the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex civil unions, could possibly open the door to civil unions in the future.
As a result of this process, the HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next legislature elected in 2015 or 2016 to remain pending.
Among Vautier's achievements outside the staging was a hunger strike in 1973 against what he saw as political censorship.
The French law has been amended. His activism dates back to the age of 15, when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He researched a book published in 1998.
In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, recently independent, to teach filmmaking.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, winner of two Olympic gold medals, died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was reported as cancer of the intrahepatic bilepan canal.
He died in Osaka on Tuesday.
In addition to being Olympic Champion and World Champion, Saito was president of the Japanese Judo Federation when he died.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple whose wedding took place last year.
The authorities stated that a formal anniversary ceremony had been scheduled for a later date.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and had come to Buffalo to celebrate the occasion with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, a native of Buffalo, was one of the four victims of the killing, but his wife was not injured.
Famous but no less controversial English tutor who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory, Karno claimed to have run 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents consider rude, and he reportedly used swear in class.
Modern Education accused him of unauthorized printing major announcements on the buses, and of purporting to be the main tutor of English.
He has also previously been charged with copyright infringement, but has not been charged.
A former student claimed that he "used slang in class, taught dredging techniques in writings, and was behaving like a friend of the students."
Over the past three decades, although it has officially remained a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economic size has increased 90-fold.
For the first time last year, China exported more cars than Germany and overtook the US as the largest market for the industry.
China’s GDP could exceed that of the US over the next two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The maximum wind speed sustained from this storm, which occurs about 4,800 km from Miami, Florida, reaches 64 km/h.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will turn into a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is far from reaching the coast, it remains difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital, Bobek became known by playing for the Belgrade Partizan.
He joined him in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time as part of the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 games.
No other player has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was voted the best player in Partizan history.
The festivities began with a special show of the world-renowned group Cirque du Soleil.
This was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band, followed by singers Fatih Erkoç and M. Gorses.
Then the turner dervishes went on stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Fire of Anatolia presented the show "Troy".
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle rider, died after being involved in an accident in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle, then was hit by his racing companion Xavier zayat.
He was immediately cared for by medical personnel on the runway and taken to a local hospital where he died afterwards.
He was released unscathed from the accident.
"As far as the global financial situation is concerned, 'the 'is the financial system', a key element, ''.
We are going through a one-year financial crisis, which has had its most acute moment in the last two months, and I think that now the financial markets are starting to recover.”
Last week, Naked News announced his intention to seriously increase the number of hours dedicated to the international language newspaper, with three new programs.
Already in English and Japanese, the world organisation is launching programmes in Spanish, Italian and Korean, for television, the web and mobile devices.
Luckily, nothing happened to me, but I saw a gruesome scene, where people were trying to break windows in order to get out.
People hit windows with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
“One of the windows finally broke, and they started to come out of the window,” said Franciszek Kowal, a survivor.
Star bodies give off light and heat because of the energy created when hydrogen atoms fuse (or condense) to create heavier elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take many years to build successful fusion reactors.
The steel needle remains submerged because of the tension at the surface.
The tension of the surface is created because the magnetism between the water molecules on the surface is so much stronger than with the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form a film invisible to the surface that allows objects like the needle to float on the water.
The blade of a modern ice skate has two ends with a concave hollow located between the two. These two ends allow better adhesion to the crystal, even when they are inclined.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, when the blade tilts on one side or the other, the edge which is in contact with the glass is also curved.
This makes the skater turn. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns left.
To return to the previous energy level, they must get rid of the excess energy stored on contact with the light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "phoron".
Scientists call this process “stimulated radiation emission,” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing a light photon to be emitted (light being a type of radiation).
The following image shows the atoms that emit photons. Of course, the photons are much smaller than those shown in the image.
Photons are even smaller than the particles forming the atoms.
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb ends up burning and the electric bulb no longer works.
The bulb must then be replaced. You have to be careful when changing the light bulb.
First, the switch of the light-signalling device shall be switched off or the cable disconnected.
This is because the electric current that flows in the socket, where the metal part of the bulb fits, can cause severe electric shocks if you come into contact with its interior or metal base while the bulb is still partially inserted into the socket.
The main organ of the cardiovascular system is the heart, it pumps blood.
Blood moves away from the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
A dentition of triceratops would have been able to crush not only leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that triceratops ate cycads, a type of plant that was very common during the Cretaceous period.
These plants resemble a small palm tree with a crown of pointed and bristling leaves.
A knieratops could have used its powerful beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very toxic, so it is unlikely that a dinosaur has eaten them, even though today, the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat toxic leaves or fruits.
How could Io's severity affect me? If you stood on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So gravity, of course, attracts you less.
The Sun has no crust like the Earth on which you can stand. The whole Sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas gets scarce as one moves away from the center of the Sun.
The outer part that we see when we look at the Sun is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just like the moon.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or Moon) facing the Sun is illuminated. The Venus phases justified the Copernicus theory that the planets revolve around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of Danelaw.
However, in 991, Ethelred had to face a more Viking fleet than any other since that of Guthrum a century earlier.
This fleet was commanded by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who had the ambition to remove his country from Danish rule.
After the first military failures, Ethereld appeared to be reached on an agreement with Olaf, for his part, who returned to Norway in an attempt to regain his kingdom, for mixed results.
Hangeul is the only alphabet originally invented for use in everyday life. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418–1480).
Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and remains one of the most respected Korean rulers.
Originally, he gave the Hangeul alphabet the name Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "correct sounds to educate the people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit came into being. One of them is an Aryan migration from the west to India that came with its language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language, which is comparable to the Latin language spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of Upanishads, Sanskrit simply erased due to the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France ended, Germany began to prepare to invade the island of Great Britain.
Germany gave the code name "Operation Sea Lion" to this attack. The British army had lost most of its heavy artillery and ammunition during the evacuation of Dunkirk, and was thus rather weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals feared being sunk by a German air attack.
Let us begin by explaining Italy's strategy, the main “dolphin” of Germany and Japan.
Their army and fleet were weaker, despite the fact that they built four new ships just before the war began.
Italy's main objectives were African countries. In order to conquer these countries, it was necessary to have a base for launching troops, so that they could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To do so, they had to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, the Italian battleships were not supposed to do anything else.
Let's move on to Japan now. Japan is an island country, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long time.
The submarines were used during the First and Second World Wars. At the time, they were very slow and had a very limited range of shootings.
At the beginning of the war, they sailed mainly on the sea. But in view of advances in radar, and given their ever-increasing accuracy, submarines were forced to pass underwater so as not to be spotted.
German submarines were called U-boat. The Germans were very good at navigating and handling their submarines.
Because of their success with submarines, after the war the Germans were not trusted to have many.
Yes. King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King All" or "The Child King", is one of the best-known ancient Egyptian monarchs of modern times.
It is interesting to note that it was not considered very important in antiquity and was not inscribed on most of the old lists of kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many of the tombs of the past were looted, this tomb remained virtually intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spoked wheels has made Assyrian tanks lighter, faster and better prepared to outpace soldiers and other tanks.
The arrows of their deadly crossbows could penetrate the armor of rival soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
A cavalry is an army that fights on horses. As the saddle had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry was fighting by going up.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. But the most famous of this civilization is probably Homer, the blind poet author of the two greatest masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagorean, best known for his famous theorem on the relationships of sides of the right triangles.
Estimates vary from the number of people who speak Hindi. It is believed that this is between the second and fourth most commonly spoken language in the world.
The number of mother tongues depends on whether or not very similar dialects are taken into account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary but a different script; in an everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can generally understand each other.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia was under strong German cultural influence.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives; that is why they invented the Estonian literal language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a character ". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
Over time, many words borrowed from German mixed. This was the beginning of development.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne did his military service after finishing his studies.
However, Charles went to university at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, earning a 2:2 (a inferior second-class degree).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to obtain a licence.
European Turkey (Eastern Tharace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,600 mi) long and 800 kilometres (500 mi) wide, with a more or less rectangular shape.
The area of Turkey, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometres, including 755,688 square kilometres in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometres in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the 37th largest country in the world and is roughly equivalent to the size of metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to only 1839.
Some of the current regions of Belgium were formerly part of Luxembourg, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830s.
Luxembourg always tried to remain a neutral country, but the territory was occupied by Germany during the First and Second World Wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the founding members of the body now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined Buddhist fortress and monastery in the upper Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that in 1649, Ngawang Namgyel created the fortress to commemorate his victory over the Turko-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire caused only a few of the Drukgyal Dzong's relics to remain, such as the image of Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of the most sensational attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was trapped between two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
At the end of the 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen per cent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those in employment work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of Venezuelans who work do so in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, of which the country is a net exporter, even though only one percent works in the oil industry.
In the wake of its independence, Singapore acquired expertise in the field of botanical gardens. This island state later turned into a tropical garden.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid hybrid, was chosen as the emblem flower of the nation.
Every year, around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores head to the southern plains, crossing the Mara River from the northern hills for rain.
And then return north from the west, crossing the Mara River once again, after the rains around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Hunting Reserve in Tanzania, as well as the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools mastered through interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design forces you to question your perception of media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
Interactive design requires that the elements of a project be linked to each other, but also that they make sense as an independent entity.
The lenses of the zoom objective have a drawback. Indeed, the complexity of the focal length and the number of lenses required to obtain a range of focal lengths are much greater than those of fixed lenses.
This becomes less problematic as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of lenses.
This allowed zooms to produce images of comparable quality to that obtained by fixed focal length lenses.
Another drawback of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is generally lower.
This makes inexpensive zoom lenses difficult to use in low-light flash-free conditions.
One of the most common problems when converting a film into DVD format is sweeping.
Most televisions are manufactured to please the general public.
For this reason, everything you watch on television has the edges cut up, down and sides.
It is therefore necessary to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called the overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably be cut too, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom of the screen, they won't appear.
The traditional medieval castle has long stimulated the imagination, evoking images of jousts, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even in the midst of ancient ruins, it is easy to remember the noises and smells of distant battles, to hear almost the clicking of the hooves on the cobblestones and to feel the fear mounting of the pits of the donjon.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Typical of the time, the castle of Kirby Muxloe is more of a fortified house than a castle.
Its glazed windows and thin walls could not have withstood a fierce assault for long.
In the 1480s, when its construction was launched by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was needed only against small bands of itinerant marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European States.
The idea was that all European nations prevented a nation from becoming powerful, which is why national governments often changed alliances in order to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession marked the First War, the main outcome of which was the balance of power.
This marked a major change, because the European powers could no longer use the pretext of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be described as a war of religion.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on 21 July 356 BC in an arson attack by Herostratus.
According to history, his motivation was celebrity at all costs. The Ephesians, indignant, announce that the name of Herostratus will never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo mentioned this name later, and that is how it has survived. The temple was destroyed the same night, which saw the birth of Alexander the Great.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was declined. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
Check that your hand is relaxed as much as possible when playing each note correctly. Also try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.
You would get tired less that way. Remember that you do not need to overemphasize the keys to resonate harder. This is the case on the piano.
With the accordion, to produce more volume, actuate the bellows by increasing the pressure or speed of the movements.
Mysticism is the search for communion, the connection with a deity or a god. It is the full awareness of a spiritual truth.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition or revelation of divine reality/of the deity or gods.
Adherents pursue certain lifestyles, or practices that aim to feed these experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious worship and belief by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a single state of consciousness, especially in the case of a peaceful, intuitive, happy, even ecstatic personality.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent, born in the 15th century in the Punjab region, following a schism within the Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a distinct religion from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their Gurmat religion, which means "guru's way" in Punjabi. The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, he has assumed the importance that forms the nucleus of Sikh beliefs.
Religion was founded in the 15th century by the guru Nanak (1469–1539). Nine other gurus have succeeded one another.
However, in June 1956, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when the riots in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Krushchev ultimately sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to certain economic requirements and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, encompassing most of present-day Pakistan and parts of north-western India and north-eastern Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the Indus basins, hence its name.
Some scholars argue, however, that since this civilization was also present in the basins of the now dried Sarasvati River, it should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, while some naming the Harappan civilization after Harappa, the first of its sites to be uncovered, in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the development of medical advances.
Emperor Augustus undertook to recruit doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to treat the victims of battles.
Surgeons knew of various sedatives such as morphine, this product from poppy seeds and scopolamine, extracted from black so-called seeds.
They became experts in amputation by saving patients from gangrene, as well as ligation clamps and arterial clamps used to contain blood flow.
Throughout the centuries, the Roman Empire has worked extensively in the field of medicine, and is at the origin of most of the knowledge we have today.
Pureland origami is an origami with the constraint that a single fold can be made at a time, more complex folds like inverted folds are not allowed, and all folds have simple locations.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who are inexperienced or have limited motor skills.
Children became aware of the notion of race and racial stereotypes at an early age, and such stereotypes affected their behaviour.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority usually perceived as poor in school tend to fail in school as soon as they discover the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have attracted a great deal of interest, especially the education component.
These sites have beneficial sides, including being able to easily set up page types that include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page is easily accessible from a single web address, making it easy to remember and write for students who do not know how to use a keyboard and who have spelling problems.
It can be customized in order to make it easier to read, and it is possible to put as much or as little color as desired.
Attention deficit disorder “is a neurological syndrome whose three characteristic symptoms are impulsiveness, difficulty concentrating and hyperactivity (or excess energy).”
It's not a learning disability. It is a learning disability that affects 3 to 5 percent of children and affects nearly 2 million American children.
Children with ADHD find it difficult to focus on things like school work, but they can focus on what they like to do, such as playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation.
These are children who tend to have significant difficulties, as they “adopt risky behaviors, fight and defy authority” in order to stimulate their brains, since it cannot be stimulated by normal activities.
ADHD affects relationships with other children, who cannot understand why patients act like this, why they spell out the way they do, or why their level of maturity is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn has changed in some way as mentioned above, the basic pace at which knowledge acquired changed.
The way the information was retrieved was different. There was no more pressure on individual memory, but the ability to remember a text became more important.
In short, the Renaissance has led to a major change in the way we look at learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Hominids no longer use their hands to walk, carry heavy loads or swing from one branch to another of a tree like other primates.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry weight in locomotion on the joints.
The man's hand is shorter than his foot, with more rigid phalanges.
The bones of a fossil, two to three million years old, reveal the mutation that the hand function underwent during the transition from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people think that making many artificially provoked lucid dreams and quite often can be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of lucid dreams that lengthen the duration between REM sleep states.
With less REM sleep per night, this state in which you enjoy a real restful sleep becomes rare enough to become problematic.
It's just as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucidly by night.
Things took a bad turn for Italians in North Africa almost from the very beginning. A week after Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the 11th British hussar seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the 10th Italian Army, General Lastucci.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and Mussolini's potential successor, was killed by a friend shot while landing in Tobruk.
The modern sport of fencing is practised at many levels, from students who learn it at university to professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport is mainly practiced in a duel format, a fencer fighting against another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls and send them into holes.
A game usually plays in eighteen holes: players usually start with the first hole of the course and end with the eighteenth.
The player who takes the fewest strokes, or swings with the club, to finish the course wins.
The game is played on the grass, and the turf that surrounds the hole is cut shorter and called the "green".
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is that most people associate with travel: Recreational tourism.
This is the moment people go to a place, completely different from what they see on a daily basis, to relax and have a good time.
The beaches, theme parks and campgrounds are often the most popular places for leisure tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to know its history and culture, this type of tourism is then called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different sites in a given country or choose to focus on a single region.
The colonizers, who had identified this activity, had also called reinforcements.
The troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1,200-strong New Hampshire Regiments, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later-to-back generals).
Stark's men took up positions along the fence, at the north end of the settler's position.
When the low tide dug a gap along the Mystic River in the north-east of the peninsula, the barrier was quickly enlarged by a stone wall to the north ending at the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 30 meters in front of the fence and ordered no one to shoot before the regulars cross it.
The American plan was based on the launching of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder launched a diversionary attack on the British garrison at Bordentown, in order to block any reinforcement.
General James Ewing crossed the river 700 militiamen at Trenton Ferry, seized the bridge over Assunpink Creek, and prevented enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 men, crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, then split into two groups, one under Greene and the other under Sullivan, in order to launch an attack before dawn.
With the passage from 400 metres to 800 metres, speed becomes much less high and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, an excellent half-distance runner, a man capable of breaking a two-minute record must have a good speed, but above all a perfectly cultivated endurance.
A little cross-country in winter, combined with indoor work for the upper body, is the best preparation for the racing season.
Good nutritional practices alone are not enough to ensure elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a good energy balance, adequate and regular hydration and good knowledge of the different aspects of nutritional supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy themselves even more in their sporting practice.
The half-back is a relatively inexpensive sport. The idea that it would require basic equipment is as false as most of the myths surrounding the sport.
Products can be purchased if the need arises, but most will have little or no real impact on the athlete's performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not bring any real benefit.
The atom may be considered to be one of the units which constitutes any material.
It is a very complex entity that consists, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, much like the planets orbiting the sun.
The nucleus consists of two neutron and proton particles.
Protons have a positive electric charge while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
Before you look at the victim, ensure your safety by inspecting the premises.
You should notice the position of the victim when you approach her and any clear warning signal.
If you hurt yourself by trying to help, you'll only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear and catastrophism were responsible for the relationship between pain and disability in people with lower back pain.
Only the effects of the disaster, not depression and fear, were conditioned by regular and structured weekly PA sessions.
Those who participate in regular activity need more support in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing between the differences between chronic pain and feeling discomfort and normal physical movement.
Vision, or the ability to see, depends on the visual system, sensory organs or eyes.
The ocular anatomies vary. They are ranked in order of complexity according to the requirements of the organism.
The various structures have different capacities, are sensitive to distinct wavelengths and have different degrees of acuity. They also require separate processing for the interpretation of the data received and the numbers they need to function optimally also differ.
A population is the set of organisms of a particular species in a given geographical area.
When all the individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic trait, they are said to be monomorphic.
When individuals have several variants of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Army ant colonies also walk and nest in different phases.
During the nomadic period, legionary ants walked by night and stopped to camp the day.
The colony began a nomadic phase when available food had decreased. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these raids or each of these raids lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word "cell" comes from the Latin word "cella", which means "small room", and was invented by a microscopist who observed the structure of the cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In the study of life, cells are so essential that they are often seen as the fundamentals of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain both the flow of blood in and off-disturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body, helping to protect it from any potential threat.
Tornadoes hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their path.
The tornadoes uproot the trees, tear off the planks of buildings and throw the cars into the sky. The two percent of the most violent tornadoes last more than three hours.
These giant storms have winds blowing up to 480 km/h (133 m/s or 300 mph).
Man has been making and using lenses for enlargement for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were manufactured in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses so that distant objects appear both larger and closer.
Greed and selfishness will always be part of us. It is natural in a cooperative relationship to win faster and faster, acting with selfishness, when the majority are favoured.
It is to be hoped that most people will realize that their best long-term option is to work together.
Many dream of the day when we can travel to another star and explore other worlds. For some, it's about what's elsewhere, others believe that aliens or other life forms could live on another planet.
However, if that were to happen, it would certainly not be for a very long time. Stars are so far apart that there are billions of miles between so-called neighboring stars.
Maybe one day, your great-grandchildren will end up in an extraterrestrial world, wondering about their distant ancestors?
Animals consist of many cells. They eat all kinds of things and digest them naturally. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (even if not all animals have brains; jellyfish, for example, have no brain).
Animals are found all over the Earth. They dig the ground, swim in the oceans and fly into the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella meaning small piece.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you'll see that they're made of small squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, an English biologist, saw small squares in cork with a microscope.
They looked like coins. He was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and components are capable of switching from one state to another without altering themselves.
Nitrogen in gaseous form retains the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules remain identical.
Water is another example. Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is a gas, a liquid or a solid.
Although its physical state may vary, its chemical structure remains constant.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects everything we do, and yet it's hard to understand.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We live in time as a series of events that pass from the future to the past and the present.
Time is also a means of comparing the duration (length) of the events.
You can mark the passing time yourself by observing the repetition of a cyclic event. A cyclical event is something that reproduces regularly.
Nowadays, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Computers can generate complex animations, increasingly used on television and in cinema.
Music is often recorded with sophisticated computers that allow you to transform and mix sounds together.
For a long time during the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New zealand were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia to a Great Fleet and took the country to the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, further evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own distinct and peaceful culture.
There was also another tribe on the Chatham Islands: they were Maori who had migrated far from New zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori, and after a few skirmishes, the Moriori were eventually eliminated.
People who have been involved for decades have helped us understand our strengths and passions while honestly assessing our difficulties and even our failures.
Listening to individuals to tell their personal, family and organizational stories, we have been able to obtain valuable insights into the past and on some of the personalities who have positively or negatively influenced the culture of the organization.
While understanding someone's story is not synonymous with understanding their culture, it helps people know at what level they are in the history of the organization.
By assessing successes and becoming aware of failures, individuals and all participating individuals are more deeply discovering the values, mission, and guiding forces of the organization.
In this case, remembering previous examples of entrepreneurial behaviour and the resulting successes helped people to open up to new changes and helped the local church take a new direction.
Such successes have reduced fears of change, while arousing positive trends towards future change.
Converging thought patterns are problem-solving techniques that unite different ideas or domains to find a solution.
This mindset is based on speed, logic and accuracy, but also the identification of facts, the mobilization of pre-existing techniques and the search for information.
The primary factor of this mindset: only one response is appropriate. You only think of two options: either that is the right answer, or it is a wrong answer.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this kind of thought have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Man is by far the most gifted species for reading in the thoughts of others.
This means that we are able to anticipate, and not without success, the perceptions, intentions, beliefs, knowledge and desires of other humans.
Among these capabilities, it is the ability of the other person to understand the intentions that matters most. It allows us to resolve any ambiguities posed by certain physical actions.
If you saw someone break a car window, for example, you would probably think they're trying to steal a stranger's car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost the keys to his car, and if it was his own car that he tried to force.
MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves mean that the atoms emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and science researcher, discovered the basics for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first body-wide MRI scanner, which he called the "Indumptable".
Asynchronous communication promotes the time of reflection and reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace while controlling the speed at which they are delivered from educational information.
In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of working with flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet allows apprentices to access information as often as they wish.
Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of the day and expect reasonably prompt answers, rather than waiting for the next meeting in person.
Absolute freedom: this is what the post-modern approach to learning offers. There is no good way to learn that would be unique in itself.
In fact, there is not a single good thing to learn. Learning is done in the experience between the learner and the knowledge presented.
This point is illustrated by our current experience of all informative television programmes on DIY and learning.
So many of us find ourselves watching a TV show that shows us a process or experience that we will never participate in or put knowledge into practice.
We're never going to renovate a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to look at ancient ruins, or redo our neighbor's house.
Thanks to fibre-optic submarine cable links to Europe and broadband satellite, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel, guest house or private residence certainly offers a Wi-Fi connection or a computer connected to the Internet, while all places have an Internet café or a place with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word “Eskimo” remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many non-American Arctic peoples, especially Canada.
Although you can hear the natives of Greenland using the word, foreigners should avoid using it.
The native inhabitants of Greenland are Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plouriel Kalaallit), Greenlandic, Greenland.
"Crimes or malicious acts in general against foreigners are not common knowledge in Greenland. Even in the city, there are no "risk areas""
Low temperatures may be the only real danger faced by unprepared ones.
If you visit Greenland during the cold seasons (as as you venture north, the cold intensifies), make sure you take with you to carry well enough warm clothes.
Long summer days can cause sleep disorders and other health problems related to these disorders.
Also pay attention to Nordic mosquitoes during the summer. Although they do not pass on any disease, their bite may be irritating.
Tourism occupies an important place in San Francisco's economy because of its international fame, but in substance its economic activities are diversified.
The main employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent performance in music, films, literature and popular culture has helped to publicize the city and its monuments around the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with many top-notch hotels, restaurants and convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best destinations in the country to discover Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
The trip to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage to many American families.
The “typical” visit is to fly to Orlando International Airport, to a Disney hotel on the site, stay around a week without leaving Disney facilities and return home.
Infinite variations are possible, but most people hear when they talk about "going to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online on auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are tickets valid in parks for several days but already partially used.
Although this activity is very common, it is banned by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
To camp below the Grand Canyon, you need a hinterland permit.
Permits, issued in a limited number to preserve the canyon, are made available from the first of the month, four months before departure.
Thus, a permit to enter the hinterland for any date of the beginning during the month of May becomes valid on 1 January.
Places in the most popular locations such as the Bright Angel Campground, a neighbour of the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with requests received on the first date of opening reservations.
Permits are limited in number and are reserved for persons who appear on the spot, on a first-come, first-served basis.
Entering southern Africa by car is an incredible way to see all the beauty of the region, as well as to get to places outside normal tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but a 4x4 is strongly recommended and many places are only accessible with a long wheelbase 4x4.
When planning, keep in mind that, although southern Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are stable.
The visa requirements and the related costs vary from country to country, and depend on the country you come from.
Each country also has unique laws requiring which first aid products should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of the country, on the other side of the border with Livingstone, in zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the falls, which are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers adventure lovers as well as tourists many possibilities for an extended stay.
During the rainy season (November to March), the volume of water will be higher and the falls will be more dramatic.
You're sure to get wet if you cross the bridge or walk along the tracks winding near the falls.
On the other hand, it is because the volume of water is extremely high that the view of the falls will be obstructed.
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the tombs in the valley, the place where Howard Carter discovered in 1922 the royal burial of the young king.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth visiting, being much smaller and with limited decoration.
Anyone wishing to see the traces of the damage caused to the mummy during attempts to remove it from the coffin will be disappointed because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer present, but have been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time would do better to pass it elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km from Siem Reap. This temple on the top of a hill was erected in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make the hill interesting.
Visiting the site can be pleasantly associated with a boat ride on the lake.
The Angkor Pass is mandatory to enter the temple, so don't forget to take your passport on your way to the Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as such.
The ancient city of the Judean hills has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is holy for the three monotheistic religions -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural centre.
The religious importance of the city, and in particular that of the many sites in the Old City, makes Jerusalem one of the main tourist destinations in Israel. 
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites as well as lively and busy shopping malls, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban nationals to obtain a letter of recommendation before they can enter Ecuador through international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be legalized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and must comply with certain conditions.
These requirements are aimed at ensuring an organized migratory flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens with a United States Green Card must visit an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exception to this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates. A round-trip ticket is required to prove the duration of your stay.
Visits are cheaper for large groups, so if you're alone or with a single friend, try to meet other people and train a group of four to six people to get a better rate per person.
However, this should not worry too much, because tourists are often mixed to fill cars.
It looks like this is a way of making people believe that they have to pay more.
This steep mountain, which dominates the northern end of Machu Picchu, often serves as a backdrop for many photos of the ruins.
It sounds a little intimidating from below, and it's a steep and difficult climb, but the fitter people should be able to do it in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps were laid along most of the path, and steel cables offered a support ramp in the steepest sections.
That said, expect to be out of breath and be careful in the steepest portions, especially in case of moisture, as it can go wrong very quickly.
Near the summit, you have to cross a rather small cave that is rather steep and has a fairly low ceiling.
The best way to see the Galapagos sites and wildlife is to take the boat, as did Charles Darwin in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships travel through the waters of the Galapagos, ranging in size from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people reserve their place well in advance (because boats are usually full during the high season).
Make sure that the agent through which you book is a Galapagos specialist with a solid knowledge of a wide variety of ships.
This will make it possible to find the ship best suited to your specific interests and/or constraints.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under Inca rule while the aracuan natives (Maput) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent American indigenous groups, which were not entirely absorbed by Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a central government operational for about two years), decisive victory over the Spaniards was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: Rep. Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Apart from the white sandy beaches and mountain scenery, the country is home to the oldest European city in the Americas, which are now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was primarily inhabited by the Tainos and the Caribs. The latter people spoke the Arawakan; it would have arrived about ten thousand years ago. J.C.
In just a few years after the arrival of European explorers, the native Taino population had declined considerably as a result of the Spanish conquistadors.
According to Brother Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), between 1492 and 1498, the Spanish conquistadors killed about 100,000 Tainos.
Jardin de la Union. This space was built as an atrium of a 17th-century convent, of which the Templo of San Diego is the only surviving building.
It now functions as the central place, and there's always a lot going on, day and night.
A large number of restaurants can be found around the garden, and free concerts often take place in the afternoon and evening from the central kiosk.
Callejon del Beso (the kissing alley). Two balconies separated by only 69 centimeters are home to an ancient legend of love.
For a few coins, children will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend excursion that offers kayaking, hiking, shopping, restaurants, and more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound, just off Vancouver, and is easily accessible by taxi boats that regularly depart from Granville Island, downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, a hike in the Sea to Sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (an hour and a half drive from Vancouver) is expensive, but became known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter, enjoy some of the best ski slopes in North America and, in summer, enjoy authentic mountain bike rides.
Permits must be reserved in advance. You must have a permit to spend the night in Sirena.
Sirena is the only forest ranger station that offers dormitory accommodation and hot meals in addition to the campsite. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping sites without catering services.
It is possible to obtain access to the park directly from the Puerto Jiménez Forest Warehouse Station, but credit cards are not accepted.
The park office (MINAE) does not issue a permit more than one month before the scheduled arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for a fee of 30 dollars, or 10 dollars for a one-day package; more information on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands Archipelago is a state in free association with the country, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometres of ocean.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes considered "Hawai of Oceania".
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of the island of Hawaii before it becomes a state with many large tourist hotels and amenities.
No city on the Cook Islands, but they are composed of 15 different islands. The main ones are called Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the offer of luxury guest rooms has been raised to a kind of artistic form.
In the top of the range, guest rooms obviously compete mainly on two points: bedding and breakfast.
As a result, it is possible to find in the best establishments in this category an extremely luxurious bedding, such as a hand-made quilt or an old bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies of the region or the specialty dish of the host.
The setting could be an old historic building with antique furniture, a maintained terrain and a swimming pool.
Get in your own car and go on a long journey has an intrinsic appeal in its simplicity.
Unlike large vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limits.
Install your tent on private property or in a city, regardless of its size, can easily attract attention.
In short, using your car is a great way to make a road trip, but rarely in itself a way to “came”.
Camping by car is possible if you have a large minivan, an SUV, a saloon or a station station with elongating seats.
Some hotels retain their heritage dating back to the golden age of steam trains and transatlantic liners of the 19th and early 20th centuries before the Second World War.
These hotels were home to the wealthy and celebrities of the time, and there were sumptuous dinners and superb receptions on a regular basis.
The old-fashioning, the absence of new equipment and a certain old-fashioned charm are also part of their character.
Although they are mostly private, some sometimes welcome heads of state or other dignitaries.
The traveller with considerable sums of money can envisage a plane tour of the world, interspersed with stays in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is the organisation that connects travellers with the inhabitants of the cities they will visit.
Joining such a network usually requires only filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require further verification.
A list of available guests is then provided either in print and/or online, sometimes with references and feedback from other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 by computer programmer Casey Fenton, who had found a cheap flight to Iceland, but no drop point to stay.
He sent an email to students at the local university and received an impressive number of free accommodation offers.
Inns are mainly aimed at young people – a typical customer in the 20s – but older travellers are also often found.
Families with children are rare, but some inns accept them in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host the Summer and Winter Games.
Beijing will host opening and closing ceremonies as well as indoor ice events.
Other skiing events will take place in the Taizicheng ski resort in the town of zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 ft) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival that begins in late November and ends in mid-May, which varies according to each individual's annual calendar.
Most of the temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple's birthday, the deity who presides over it, or on the occasion of any other major event associated with the temple.
Kerala temple festivals are very interesting to see, with frequent decorated elephant processions, the temple orchestra, and other festivities.
An international exhibition (commonly known as the World's Fair or Simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries organize arts and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions to highlight global issues or the culture and history of their country.
International horticultural exhibitions are specialized events with floral display cases, botanical gardens and everything related to plants.
Although they theoretically take place every year (provided it is in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
These events normally last between three and six months and take place at sites of at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. The standard 35 mm film (negative 36 by 24 mm) is by far the most common.
It can generally be replenished fairly easily in the event of exhaustion and offers a resolution roughly comparable to that of a current DSLR.
Some medium-format cameras use a format of 6 by 6 cm, more precisely a negative of 56 by 56 mm.
This gives a resolution almost four times that of a negative of 35 mm (3136 mm2 against 864).
Wild fauna and flora are some of the most difficult themes to capture for a photographer, and require a combination of luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wildlife photography is often considered self-evident, but as for photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens. However, other scenes such as a flock of birds or a tiny creature require the use of other lenses.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules for taking photographs for commercial purposes.
Wild animals can be shy or aggressive. The environment may be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
The world has more than 5,000 different languages, including about 20 with 50 million speakers or more.
Written words are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This is particularly true for addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce in an understandable way.
Many nations, as a whole, are fluent in English, and in many other countries, it can be expected to be partially known, especially among young people.
Imagine, if you will, a resident of Manchester, a resident of Boston, a Jamaican and a resident of Sydney, sitting around the same restaurant table in Toronto.
They feast each other on stories from their hometowns, told with their pronounced accents and local slang.
Buying food in supermarkets is usually the cheapest way to eat. Without the possibility of cooking, however, choices are limited to ready-to-use foods.
Supermarkets increasingly offer a more varied range of cooked dishes. Some even provide a microwave oven or other means of heating food.
In some countries or types of sales outlets, there is at least one restaurant on site, often quite informal and at affordable prices.
Make copies of your insurance policy and contact details of your insurer and take them with you.
They must present the insurer's e-mail address and international telephone numbers for advice/authorization and compensation claims.
Make another copy available in your luggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment, or stored in the cloud).
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in its memory or disk (available offline).
Also provide regulatory copies and contacts to fellow travellers and relatives or friends at home who are ready to help you.
The mowings are not aggressive in nature, but will defend themselves if they feel in danger.
When people do not consider the impulses to be potentially dangerous, they can come too close and put themselves in peril.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol has different effects on everyone, and it is very important to know its limits.
Possible long-term health problems due to alcoholism include damage to the liver, but also blindness and death. The potential danger is increased in the case of consumption of illegally manufactured alcohol.
Illegal spirits may contain a variety of dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death, even in small doses.
View glasses can cost less abroad, especially in low-income countries where the cost of labour is lower.
Think about having your eyes examined at home, especially if your insurance covers it, and bringing back the prescription that will then be filed elsewhere.
High-end branded executives sold in such parts of the world can have two problems: some may be counterfeits, and truly imported executives can be more expensive than in your country.
Coffee is one of the best-selling commodities in the world, and you can probably find many types of coffee in your home area.
Nevertheless, there are many ways to drink coffee around the world that are worth experimenting.
Canyoning (or canyonism) consists of going to the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or full of water.
Canyoning combines swimming, climbing and jumping elements, but requires relatively little training or fitness to begin, compared to, for example, climbing, scuba diving or alpine skiing.
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails.
A one-day hike involves distances of less than one mile up to longer distances that can be covered in a single day.
For a day hike on a difficult trail, it takes only a few preparations and any relatively healthy person can enjoy it.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but it is possible to spend a day outdoors, even with babies and pre-school children.
Internationally, there are nearly 200 travel organizations. Most of them work independently.
Global Running Tours' successor, Go Running Tours, is networking dozens of tourist jogging service providers on four continents.
Rooted in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and the Copenhagen Running Copenhagen in Copenhagen, it was quickly joined by the Prague-based Running Tours Prague and others.
There are many things to consider before and while you're traveling.
When you travel, expect that things are not like “at home”. Ways, laws, food, traffic, housing, norms, language, etc. differ to some extent from where you live.
This is something that you should always keep in mind to avoid disappointment or perhaps even any aversion to local behavior.
Travel agencies have been in existence since the 19th century. A tour operator is generally a good option for a journey that goes beyond the traveller's previous experiences in nature, culture, language, or low-income country.
Although most agencies are willing to take care of most regular bookings, many agents specialise in more specific types of travel, price ranges or more destinations.
It may be preferable to use an officer who frequently reserves travel similar to yours.
Take a look at the travel that the agent is promoting, whether on a website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world at low cost, out of necessity, lifestyle or challenge, there are a few ways to do it.
Basically, they can be divided into two categories: either you work during your trip or you try to limit your spending. This article focuses on the latter category.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability to cut spending to close to zero, check out the minimum budget trip.
These councils are based on the assumption that travellers do not fly, enter a public place, do not participate in the illegal market, beg or exploit other persons for their benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first step when you disembark from an airplane, boat or other vehicle.
In some cross-border trains, inspections are carried out on the moving train and you must have a valid identity document on you when you are travelling on one of these trains.
In night-deck trains, passports can be collected by the conductor so as not to interrupt your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries you need to register and indicate the address of your place of stay with the local authorities.
This may require filling out a form with the local police or a visit to immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will take care of the check-in themselves (don't forget to ask).
In other cases, only persons residing outside tourist accommodation must register. However, the law is much more obscure, so it will be necessary to obtain information beforehand.
The architecture relates to the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a site is often a tourist attraction in its own right.
Many buildings are pretty pleasant to look at, and the view offered by large buildings or cleverly placed windows can be strikingly beautiful.
Architecture cuts across considerably other areas, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscaping.
Due to the remoteness of many pueblos, you will not be able to find an important nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all the casinos mentioned above serve beverages, and several of them offer high-quality distractions (mainly the large casinos located near Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small town bars here are not always good places to hang out if you are a foreign visitor.
On the one hand, northern New Mexico has significant drunk driving problems, and the concentration of drunk drivers is high near small town bass.
Undesirable murals or doodles are known as graffiti.
Although it is far from being a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with the fact that young people are vandalizing public and private properties using aerosol paint.
Today, however, there are recognized graffiti artists, discipline events and “authorized” areas to indulge in it. Under these conditions, graffiti more often resembles true works of art than indecipherable vulgar tags.
Boomerang's throw is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that turns you directly into your hand, then make sure you have a boomerang designed to come back.
In fact, most of the boomerangs available in Australia do not return. It is better for beginners not to try to throw into the wind.
A hangi meal is cooked in a hot pit dug in the ground.
The pit is either heated with hot stones from a fire, or geothermal heat naturally heats up certain areas of the ground.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional roasted dinner.
Several locations in Rotorua offer geothermal hangings, while other hangis can be sampled in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail offers two classes in the suburban trains of Cape Town and its surroundings: MetroPlus (also called first class) and Metro (called third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but cheaper, while remaining cheaper than the normal fare for metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has Metro and MetroPlus wagons; the MetroPlus wagons are always at the end of the train closest to the Cape.
Wearing for others – never lose sight of your bags, especially when you cross international borders.
Someone could use you to transport drugs without your knowledge, which would get you into big trouble.
This includes online waiting, as drug sniffer dogs can be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, the sanctions are extremely draconian, even for the first offences; they can go as far as prison sentences of more than ten years or the death penalty.
Unsupervised bags are a target for theft and can also attract the attention of authorities who are suspicious of bomb warnings.
At home, because of this constant exposure to local germs, the chances are very high that you are already immune to them.
But in other parts of the world, where bacteriological fauna is new to you, you're much more likely to be in trouble.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Thus the scourges of Delhi Belly, the curse of the pharaoh, the vengeance of Montezuma and their many friends.
As with breathing problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warm climates are quite common and, in most cases, are particularly troublesome but not really dangerous.
If you are travelling for the first time in a developing country or a part of the world that you do not know, do not take the possible cultural shock lightly.
Many stable and skilled travellers have been overwhelmed by the novelty of travel to developing countries, where many small cultural adjustments can quickly accumulate.
Especially at the beginning, think about making follies in hotels, food and Western-style services to help you acclimatize.
Do not sleep on a mattress or cushion on the ground in areas where you do not know the local wildlife.
If you go camping, bring a camp bed or hammock to stay away from snakes, scorpions and the like.
Fill your house with the aroma of intense coffee in the morning and evening, with a relaxing chamomile herbal tea.
When you are staying, you have time to enjoy yourself and take a few extra minutes to prepare something special.
If you feel more adventurous in mood, take the opportunity to prepare a juice or mix smoothies:
You may discover a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city where the drink is growing, go to the bars or pubs of the neighborhoods you don't frequent.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, the words “infectious” and “contagious” have a distinct meaning.
An infectious disease is that caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, a bacterium, fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is an easily transmissible disease when you are in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many Governments require visitors entering their country or residents who leave them to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on the countries visited by a traveller, or intend to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte, North Carolina, is the abundance of high-quality services for families.
Residents of other regions often cite family conviviality as the main reason for their settlement, and visitors often find the city easy to enjoy with children next door.
Over the past 20 years, the number of child-friendly options in Charlotte's business district has grown exponentially.
In general, families do not use taxis in Charlotte, although the latter may prove useful in certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge to have more than two passengers, so this option could be more expensive than indispensable.
Antarctica, which surrounds the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Touring is expensive, requires good physical condition, can only take place in the summer (November to February) and are largely limited to the peninsula, the islands, and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in summer in about 40 bases, mainly in these areas; a small number of them remain in winter.
Indoor Antarctica is a desolate plateau covered with 2 to 3 km of ice.
Specific and punctual aerial expeditions to the interior, for mountaineering or to reach the Pole, with a broad base.
The South Pole Highway is a 1,600 km road between McMurdo Station, on the Ross Sea, and the pole.
This is compacted snow, with crevices filled and marked by flags. It may only be travelled by specialized tractors, sledging carrying fuel and supplies.
The latter are not very agile, so the track has to make a long swing around the trans-Anctic mountains to arrive on the plateau.
In winter, the most frequent cause of accidents is the sliding nature of roads, pavements and especially steps.
Shoes with adequate soles, that's the minimum. Summer shoes very often slide on ice and snow, even some models planned for winter do not depart.
The pattern shall be sufficiently deep, either 5 mm (1/5 in) or more, and the material shall be sufficiently flexible in cold weather.
Some boots are provided with studs and there is additional stud equipment for slippery conditions, which is suitable for most shoes and boots, for heels or heels and sole.
The heels must be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often dispersed on roads or paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not abnormal phenomena; steep slopes can retain only a small amount of snow, the excess of which spreads in the form of an avalanche.
The problem is that the snow sticks, so if it collapses, is that there was a trigger. However, a slight collapse of snow can be the trigger for everything else.
Sometimes the trigger is solar warming on snow, sometimes it's just more snow, and other times it can be natural events or human activity.
A tornado is a column-shaped low-pressure air vortex, the surrounding air is sucked inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects in the air, carrying them as the tornado moves.
They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and become "torcamdes" when they touch the earth.
Personal VPN (VPN) providers are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They are superior to web proxy for several reasons: they redirect all the traffic online, not just the http.
They normally offer greater bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
Media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this measure, claiming that it aims to “prevent piracy”.
In fact, the regional codes have absolutely no effect on the illegal copy; a bit-by-bit copy of a disk works very well on any device where the original can be played.
The real goal is to give these companies greater control over their markets; it is about making money.
As calls are routed via the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company where you live or where you are travelling.
Nor is it mandatory to get a local number from the community you live in; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the wilderness of Chicken, Alaska, and select a number that indicates that you are in the sunny Arizona.
Often, you have to buy an international number that allows calls in RCTPS. The place where your phone number is located is crucial for the people who call you.
Real-time translation applications are apps that can automatically translate entire segments of text, from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category may even translate foreign language texts written on panels or other everyday objects when the user points his smartphone towards them.
Translation engines have improved considerably, and now often give more or less correct translations (and more rarely gibberish), but care must be taken, because they may still be wrong.
One of the most popular applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translations after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS navigation applications on your smartphone can be the simplest and most convenient way for your travel outside your country of residence.
It can save money by buying new maps for a GPS or an autonomous GPS device, or by renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection on your phone, or if it is out of reach, its performance may be limited or unavailable.
Each corner store is filled with a confusing panoply of prepaid phone cards that can be used from payphones or ordinary phones.
While most cards allow to be called everywhere, some are specialized in offering advantageous rates for specific groups of countries.
Access to these services is often achieved through a toll-free telephone number that can be called free of charge from almost all telephones.
The rules concerning regular photography also apply to, or even more, video recording.
If it's forbidden to take a simple picture of something, you don't even have to think about recording a video.
If you are using a drone, check in advance on what you are allowed to film and what additional permits or licences are needed.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, it is rare for people to book their flight directly via the airline without having previously sought and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can have wide tariff differences between aggregators; before booking, it is therefore advantageous to compare search results and to consult the airline's website itself.
If you do not need a visa for short-term stays in certain countries as a tourist or for business trips, going there as a foreign student usually requires a longer stay than a simple tourist.
In general, to stay in a foreign country for a long period of time, you must first obtain a visa.
The application procedures and requirements for student visas are generally different from those of standard tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a letter of acceptance from the institution in which you wish to study, as well as sufficient proof of funds to support yourself at least during the first year of your study.
For details of the conditions, see at the institution and the immigration service of the country in which you wish to study.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you will have to file the income tax return in the country where you are based.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and tax rates and tax brackets vary widely from country to country.
In some federal countries such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels, so that rates and tax brackets may vary from region to region.
While immigration control is generally absent or a formality upon arrival in your country of origin, customs control can be a source of hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring, and declare everything beyond the legal limits.
The easiest way to learn about travel articles is to hone a perfect on a well-established travel blog.
Then, and only after you have mastered online formatting and editing, you can create your own website.
Volunteering on a trip is an excellent way to make a difference, but it is not just a matter of giving.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country is an excellent way to discover a different culture, to meet new people, to get to know each other, to gain new perspectives and even new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch a budget for a longer stay somewhere, as many volunteer jobs offer accommodation and food and some pay a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check the need for special permits, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mainly through rivers and lakes.
The Onega Lake is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to come from the Caspian Sea via Russia.
Rest assured: once you reach the marinas, everything will be clear. You will meet other hitclads, who will share their information with you.
Basically, you will display announcements to offer your help, walk the platforms, approach people cleaning their yachts, try to get to know the browsers at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and give you directions on the boat looking for someone.
You must carefully choose your Frequent Flyer airline as part of an alliance.
Even if you think it is intuitive to join the airline you travel with most, you should know that the privileges offered are often different and that the loyalty point system may be more generous with another airline of the same alliance.
Airlines such as Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have greatly expanded their offerings in Africa, and offer routes to major African cities at competitive rates compared to other European airlines.
In 2014, Turkish Airlines sold 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have more time to travel, compare the total ticket price to Africa with the price of a ticket to the world.
Don't forget to add the extra fees for visas, departure taxes, land charges, etc. for all these places outside Africa.
If you want to travel around the world by flying only in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations will be limited due to the lack of transoceanic roads.
There are no airline alliances covering the junctions of the three oceans in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of them).
However, Star Alliance covers everything except the Eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged a war against the Azeris.
With the support of Armenia, a new republic was established. However, no established nation, not even Armenia, officially recognizes it.
Diplomatic incidents in the region continue to undermine relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The canal district (Dutch grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district surrounding the Binnenstad of Amsterdam.
The entire district is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and real estate prices are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on the rugged and steep landscape to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm lies in the lack of visible development of companies. Roads, trains and boats connect villages, and cars from outside cannot access them.
The variants of French practiced in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from French spoken in France, although they are sufficiently similar to be mutually intelligible.
The numbering system of French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland notably presents some small features which differ from French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of certain words is slightly different.
Nevertheless, all Belgians and French-speaking Swiss would have learned standard French at school, so they would be able to understand you even if you were using the standard French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, making a hand-waking is a friendly gesture that means “hello”.
In Malaysia, however, at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means “come here”, such as folding the index finger towards oneself, a gesture used in some Western countries, and it should only be used in this sense.
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain could confuse a farewell sign made by a person who turns the palm of his hand towards himself (rather than to the person to whom she is writing it) with an invitation to return.
The auxiliary languages are languages, artificial or constructed, created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise have difficulty communicating.
They are distinct from the vehicular languages, which are natural or organic languages which become dominant for one reason or another as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
With the heat of the day, travellers can see mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the passenger pursues the mirage, thus squandering valuable energy and the remaining water.
Even the hottest desert can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk if you do not have warm clothes.
It is especially in summer that you will have to pay attention to mosquitoes if you plan to hike in the rainforest.
Even if you drive in the rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open while you get into the vehicle is enough for the mosquitoes to get in the vehicle with you.
Avian influenza, or more formally avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
Less than 1,000 cases have been reported in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most involved people who worked with poultry, but there was also some risk to birdwatchers.
The steep fjords and valleys that suddenly give way to a more or less regular high plateau are typical of Norway.
These trays are often referred to as "video", to designate a vast space without trees, an unlimited expanse.
In Rogaland and Adger, they are often referred to as "hei", meaning deforested landes often covered with heather.
Glaciers are not stable, but stand out from the mountain. This causes cracks, cracks, which can be obscured by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves can collapse and the cracks close.
At the edge of glaciers, huge blocks come off, fall, and perhaps bounce or roll away from the edge.
The tourist season of mountain resorts usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, their beauty and charm evolve in winter, with many mountain resorts with good snow and offering activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer mourning rates, which slightly reduce the cost of last-minute funeral travel.
The airlines offering them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States or Canada, and WestJet.
In any case, you must make a telephone reservation directly with the airline.
