This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but it provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. . According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown brown at the top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information about the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of the dinosaur is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other typical characteristics of the feathers, beards and barbulae, the researchers concluded that the spine is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for the flight, but rather for the regulation of the temperature or for the courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows an adult plumage and not the chick duvet.
According to the hypotheses of the researchers, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals a plumage as an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

The bill provides that violent video games sold in the State of California is affixed to a label read "18" and makes it punishable to sell it to minors with a fine of $1,000 per violation.
This morning the prosecutor, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to serve as Minister for Business Deleted by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at the Westminster Magistrates Court is scheduled for February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, was 21.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when she was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, he is blind in one eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified by videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where at the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which he participated, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's group of the "sitting" category, with a combined travel time of 4:41.30, slower than 2:11.60 minutes compared to the first classified, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Hungarian Gyongyi Dani.
Four female female skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants at the Giant Slalom did not rank in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police managed to retrieve the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya said: “Fire five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found his cell phone and his laptop.”
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been at the Edinburgh Sheriff's court on charges of killing his own son.
She is detained pending indictment and trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be polluted, as her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: “Journalists who publish photos or other suspects walk on mine ground.”
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for court proceedings, has told reporters that no new comments will be made until the formal indictment.
According to the leak, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
Shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting programme, the NPWS in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O’Flynn, acting director of the Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters chosen for the first shooting operation received exhaustive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission set up Martelly’s response to the widespread protests that began in October that challenge the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to run the elections, some of which have been planned since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and caused minor burns to four people.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related incidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "not serious".
In its response, the ministry called Apple's postponement of the report "absolutely deplorable".
The Marianne earthquake was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage was reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no signs of tsunami going on.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were freed immediately along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an old lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins retraced his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
After following training in midwifery, he entered work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that administering a hormone would accelerate the aging of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two ‘black boxes’ with flight recordings.
His wrestling companions also wanted to pay tribute to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said: “The moon was the first Queen of the Far. - My first manager. She died in the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
"Moon was as weird as I did... Maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... Let's hope she's in a better place," was Dustin's comment "Goldust" Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to the passage of Australia to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said he believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of survey participants, Queen Elizabeth II is expected to be Australia’s last monarch.
At opposites in the survey, 29% of respondents say that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200-meter freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but blamed several ailments that led to doubt its fitness.
He could not take the necessary drugs to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that have led water and organic matter to earth, i.e. matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed his signature on a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, speculation is nothing but "political talk and idiocies".
A candidacy for the presidency in 2016 is envisaged.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system employs satellite technology instead of the outdated ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transport is not being set up and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, while parking for cars or interchange parking are not available on site.
Fears related to the absence of means of transport have revealed the possibility of having the game played behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of birds were born on the Galapagos islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, the United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time it took for this process was much greater; this was the effect of the coupling between a Darwin endemic finch, Geospiza fortes, and the frig of the immigrated cacti, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can be rolled up to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled to form a thin thread, suitable for twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into foils.
It can be made very thin and attached on other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "minisonate codes" thanks to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the juice of the red cabbage it is possible to build a pH indicator.
The cabbage juice changes color based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the chemical analyzed is the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
By hydrogen ions we mean protons to which the electrons have been torn away (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, put them in a ball.
Between the humidity on their hands and the outer layers you will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and will form a kind of shell.
Almost all the houses in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a running water bathroom with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, the homes of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini have been discovered remains of sewage.
Cabinets in antiquity also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in the public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth’s atmosphere partly distorts light and visual.
To transport a satellite or a telescope to transport a rocket over 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages that it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport have appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on small prey, considerably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The niche concept is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called herds.
The herds are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The herd of lions acts in a very similar way to the herd of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly analogous to that of the lions (but not to that of other large cats), also with regard to the deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) of the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as the lion’s, but it looks more like a phrase of shouted and angry words.
Ogelotti love feeding on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the ogelotti follow and find the animals to eat (predate) thanks to the sense of smell, sniffing to the ground where they were.
Thanks to night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, the ogelottos camouflage themselves with the surrounding environment and then plunging them on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment than the one it was previously in.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, to place itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations compared to those previously necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it looks less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb carbon dioxide ejected by them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make a shadow.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosaur was the superpredator of his era and for this reason he feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws sprang more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus another row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed his path there was no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that fits into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their foods would look familiar to us, Roman banquets also featured several strange or unusual courses, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a kind of rodent called dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, rich men loved to feast together lying on their side while eating their meal.
Of course the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods, which came to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an internal sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurat, were built, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of paramount importance.
Much of the Jewish family's life was held outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor counters overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Nordic sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who named her, having met Greenland on her journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already there.
Although they are all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the film "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence a treasure map is drawn.
Anyway, this is false. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Declaration of Original Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large document of parchment (measures 29.75 inches for 24.5 inches) has been rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing clashes had led the north of France to liberation, but the south was still occupied.
He was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of "Operation Dragoon".
The American and French Free forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and headed to Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people living and working collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", that is, a citizen, and "civitas", or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the dimensions of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. The culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and Congress was the only component of it, according to the Statute of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on the often unrelated state authorities for the application of its acts.
He didn’t even have the authority to bypass tax laws and tariffs between states.
To modify the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required. These for their part had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German one, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 car races.
Winter sports are most widespread in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands are part of the Japanese (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considering the presence of groups of islands that compose it.
Taiwan was founded in the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through shortly there recorded the name of the island under the name of Ilha Formosa, or a wonderful island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, beginning a transformation that concerned the cereal production systems of the Aboriginal and by hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Tre Finestre Temple.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more precise idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the most used film at the end of the era of analog photography.
It still produces today and, most importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Oddly enough, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the APS format family) are the same or very close to this value.
The much-tapped and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to place the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into third parties, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
At this stage of European history, the Catholic Church, which has become rich and powerful, set out to be under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customary.
Its omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church’s monetary reserves exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to wonder whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it provided for the interruption of any essential military and civilian supply, although this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent access by any boat to entire sections of the ocean, putting neutral ships at risk.
As this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine war campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and brutalities of the First World War, the nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company of New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendations written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, the different time periods were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or every family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, fierce wars were fierce wars among many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in Xi'an's imposing palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the conviction that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Moreover, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same is true for the military, since the army rankings, instead of being based on the class, are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had deep interest in the issues that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of Muhammad’s spirituality.
The cave rests on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if it was known to exist. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a great deal of mountains around. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little about the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one who has come to the present day, not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plain, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and family.
The indication "array up" resembles a V and the indication "eye down" to a paper clip or a square without the underside.
Towards the top means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and downwards it means that you should start from the alamaro (which is where your hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while with a descending arc acron is a louder and stronger sound.
You can decide to add your personalized directions to pencil, but keep in mind that the signs of the arching that you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of women on the market forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Teresa of 11 years and Louis Charles of 4 years) and to Elizabeth, the king's sister.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and the queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses, and interest on bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the enormous gains from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people made up the profits at the base of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Pieno Medioevo was preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the strict sense that man’s destiny is moved by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology has in turn “effects” on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a road network development.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for the care of injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, dealt with by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time the customs, customs and culture linked to such geography have arisen that, being in harmony with the context of society, have been more effective than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly in Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as the nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige decreased, mainly because the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing underwent the strong influence of the East Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of the communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West can delay by 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, the result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing sufficient to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually biological, system that uses preserved seeds originating in the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures unite individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel themselves representing from the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or gender of its members.
Characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Often members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argots.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, as a result of misfortune, or by the effect of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "ferals" or savage. Some of them have been segregated from people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Feral children may have suffered severe violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others seem to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When the feral child is totally raised by non-human animals, he shows behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that has taken care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while the scaffold goes a little further.
Saffolding is not a way of learning, but the more a helper for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is the small paper-shaped assistant of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to query, solicit and explain the procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on his own.
Children are given in foster care for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not guarantee nourishment, care and training, but happens to them.
We believe that foster care is a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The custody is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were picked up.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage theory and gratification.
For example, as important reasons for the use of the Internet are suggested to "learning" and "socialization" (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on the public’s reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely “personal involvement” and “continuous relations.”
The use of video recording has made it possible to achieve significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying interpreting the microexpressions correctly.
In his essay "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation is added a new genetic variability, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans it is difficult to meet one’s amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Moreover, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, also death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest, unless they are cooked.
Animal feed, on the other hand (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a sense as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a resumption of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be put into practice by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without awakening completely.
If you decide to reset your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm options involve consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposed to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each of us has the potential capacity to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve the lighting. This goal is hindered only by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayan rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based in Kundalini Yoga, in meditation and in an all-encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (enhagen of lighting) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness develops.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts have caused the break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the allies of the past had become enemies; the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved to be immediately obsolete, at a time when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Leveraging freight ships is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguard of their ability to move people and goods, while countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples in support of this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have had the chance to win Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
Apparently, the goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
They began to be bred by the cultures and tribes of antiquity to easily have milk, fleece, meat and skin available.
House goats were usually raised in herds left free to move around the hills or other grazing areas, often looked after by goats (sogists of shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of pastoralism are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, the wagonways were built in England.
Although they were simply formed by parallel wooden planks, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rugged roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled them to reach greater speeds and move heavier loads.
The crossbars were introduced relatively early to hold the tracks in position. Gradually, however, it was understood that the tracks would have been more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron wheels. In 1767 the first rails were fully ironed.
The first means of transport that man knew were the legs. Humans began walking in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "electronic man").
His predecessor, the australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back to 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can begin to adopt lifestyles that are more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement and also do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, on the other hand, we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed much due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
In the night between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap Manifests".
The document was first read publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which had her read to her troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap's 25 broadsides still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists today, a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are the ones we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, lay their eggs and walk on the two hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in the technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
The internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. His symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of a container of drugs or open harmful chemicals.
Check if there are first aid instructions on the label regarding that specific poison.
The term acaro is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both the killer sheepbuds and the bedbugs of the beds are nestlings, that is, adapted to live in the nest or home of their guest.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) has about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among the neurological diseases that affect young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
The research showed that the chances of developing MS among females are twice as many as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their own interest, or in their own child’s.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In one adoption, natural parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not just about experimentation, given that an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle’s opinions on the various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, relative to most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is, viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved, and depending on whether the affected cells belong to the germline.
Mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the level of germ cells; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small country villages to drive to work, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic outgoings, everyone is somehow connected to a private car-based transport system, which they also support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints concerning water quality or ruining bridges.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers designing them that they are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
The "Traffic Flow" (i.e. "combust") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
The three main variables were correlated to achieve a more accurate representation of the traffic flow: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to take off. The ability to fly has allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects are advantaged by the ability to fold the wings along the body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small ravines to hide from predators.
Among all the insects existing today, the only ones who are unable to fold the wings are dragonflies and ephemeral.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed otherwise, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, why don’t we feel that the Earth moves, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the largest river on Earth, with a width that in some places reaches six miles.
The total 20% of the water that pours from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It pours the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to build stone pyramids until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of the greatness and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanting admiring the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the least population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of everyday use spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man has begun to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These in fact resemble more the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also theorized that they would turn into new substances, forming what we see.
The alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Please note that the periodic table contains a number of elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get into the point at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil turned out to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to approach a pencil sharpener.
We can only ask ourselves what fate the keyboard will have when something newer comes.
The principle that energy is needed to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the operation of the fission bomb.
In practice it is like rolling a heavy trolley on a hill. Then, further dividing the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of a poor or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The maria could be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the ascent of the lava on the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and pushes them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Theory of Needs Hire and Herzberg's Two-Centre Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the opposite extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, who feels he has to change the entire work of the team and do it his own.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreement between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
The members of the virtual team often have the touch point function for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as matches can take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
It defines "invisible team" as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process leading to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement the concepts of organizational learning can be innovation.
When you manage to use all the resources available effectively in all of an organization’s functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
In order for an organization to be defined as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The search area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that some types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and modify certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unentected brain structures and processes.
This gives us a great deal of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong sci-fi connotation, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes making machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some application examples are control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as writing, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into different software applications for home computers and video games.
Outgoings are a key part of teaching. Teachers would often like to take their students to places they cannot reach by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual outings. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing experiences and travel reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are marked by a little-curated grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, to avoid negative judgment the blog author is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also “force students to become more aware of the moment around them.” The need to feed the public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outlining their perspectives on specific issues” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the suggestive and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the past and present of the country.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoilt beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The larger areas of northern are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising to many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as the luxurious seaside resorts, are mostly independent or associated nations with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape course, from Europe to India, by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For travelers: it is recommended that everyone declare that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one with an expensive appearance).
Women should realize that cultural differences can give rise to what they consider to be a harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; under the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then called Casablanca by Spanish traders who chose these places for their trading bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the surroundings of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, hookah and a lot of knitting, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to read well before making any visits outside of Goma, so as to evaluate well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see Africa’s mountain gorillas.
You can use a boda-bod (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short run.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has ended up becoming a metaphor of exotic and distant earth.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates' special of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabic-like rather than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the others of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, to the north borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park includes 14 different ecozones, each of which sustens to a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa’s main attractions and is considered to be the most important of South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South Africa’s national parks, there are daily contributions for the conservation and entry to the park.
Buying a Wild Card may also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, is for many tourists the main destination.
The series of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, even more evident because it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong has focused on the reclaimed land of the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove in the world. It stretches for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of forest included in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: in them there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of marshy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; in the area it is estimated the presence of 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to get to nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stacked bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who lived on hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the meeting between the Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the pole camps of Las Canitas.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
To receive information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. Stanley can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It is likely that credit cards are unlikely to accept on the outlying islands, although British and US currencies can be welcomed. Check in early with the owners to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so you change the money before leaving.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30 degrees C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a lower temperature than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "pivovous" seasons: the amount of rain is kept almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to the sight of man, the fauna is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, moose, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors suffer injuries for not having kept an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid taking with you or cooking foods with very strong odors, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port the infamous naval stalemate of 1889 occurred, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 U.S. and German lives have been lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
Beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the harbour of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families that are sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can take a bath safely.
The best-known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta."
You may have a lot of French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand wines could better cope with the journey.
The tap water of the place is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, the bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. 'Express' is short black coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is at the same level as the Belgian one. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year many changes are made on the coral reef and injuries to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always ask the authorities for advice, follow the instructions and pay special attention to safety warnings.
The cubomeduses appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period you can only find it occasionally.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear him and tend to keep his distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly made up of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not actively living them in the ocean.
When you book in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most of the participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and win a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is over on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the ice crossing causes rather annoying noises for those who are more exposed.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted exemption from the visa requirement (verify the conditions).
Generally, casinos go to great lengths to increase as much time and money as possible from their guests. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and the exits can be hard to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood of guests high make them hold back.
In some rooms alcoholic beverages are offered from the house. However, the state of intoxication alters judgment and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snow-capped carriageways, friction is reduced and you cannot drive as when you are on the clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, in no time it can fall so much snow that you get stuck.
Precipitation and snow gusts, or ice formation or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterruptedly throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the hub of many visitors’ holiday.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to land-based travels, particularly in the savannah, to see beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking" safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and part of the events will take place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your flight and accommodation reservation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most of the coronavirus-related cancellation policies at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
It is expected that the cost of most tickets for events will be between 2,500 and 130,000 pounds, while normal tickets will cost around 7,000 pounds.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easy to dry. Many hotels offer the use of the iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear ironed socks, you can try with a hair dryer if you have it available.
Be careful not to subject the tissues to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these turn out to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travellers can come into contact with animal parasites that are not widespread in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are usually not qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to buy tax- and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses areas isolated between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and tight curves predominate.
The displayed speed limits are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile service is much higher than that present in other stretches of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked cakes also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste small but flavorful sweets, can be oriented on those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can occur both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan for curry in the inland regions, yogurt is normally used; in southern India and some other coastal region of the subcontinent coconut milk is more used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally indicates foods originating in the central and eastern area of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the feet of the rider and are hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems for the chance that the knight's feet will remain blocked there.
If a jockey is thrown by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the run-away horse. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures that you can take.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially the English ones, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamo Valley: Chile’s most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are drawn.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new ways on its walls, potentially endless.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very widespread and provide for slipping on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also called "ski bums" (the skids for skiing), which devote entire periods of holiday to skiing in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very old: the first rock paintings with the depiction of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering or skiing trekking.
It is connected, although usually does not understand them, to the touring or skimo skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking-like route.
If the conditions are good, you can cover distances in some way greater than those traveled by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would have to apply for a visa and pass through passport control several times.
However, with regard to this, the Schengen area works rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from one border to another without having to pass your passport checks again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antiques. Some tax agencies consider such an item that it is at least 100 years old.
The definition differs from the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Crafts may be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar objects produced in series.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Soms and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over the past, not all the Soms were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some were living on fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer especially as working animals.
Today, many Sami carry out modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sopmi, the territory of the Sami.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a wrong perception of Roma people.
If a traveler warning is issued for the destination you visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or insurance in case of travel cancellation.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To give an example, American citizens in the Middle East may encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The notices are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The opinions are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse Weather Conditions" is the general expression indicating any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social hardship, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similarly to thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are blizzards, blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travelers are recommended to inquire about the adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they could affect the planning of the trip.
Anyone who plans to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on Hostile Environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A normal course lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first-aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
The books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers who are planning surgery to change sex abroad must ensure that they have the valid documents for the return trip with them.
Governments’ intention to issue passports without any indication of sex (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents.
Inspections at security checks also became much more scrupulous in the post-September 11 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass controls without their privacy and dignity being affected.
The undertow currents are the return flow of the crashing waves on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue in an attempt to swim against the current, which may prove impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you don’t risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for help, based on your skills and whether you’ve been spotted.
The re-entry shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (being a smaller "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty adapting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the uses of your culture of origin.
In the first experience abroad, it is likely to have met patients and understand people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were also necessary for those who return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is the most interesting in the area for children.
Before the beginning of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The sound and light show is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest island and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano filled with water from origin to a magnificent natural harbour.
The land of Ellsworth is the region south of the peninsula and overlooks the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360-kilometer chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Monte Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not generally a substitute for the mobile phone, because to call you must find yourself outdoors with the clear view up to the satellite.
The service is often used by pleasure boats, including pleasure boats, as well as missions that need data and voice at a distance.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among recent graduates, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education when returning to your country of origin.
Usually enrolling in these educational programs requires the payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
It does not necessarily require a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Nautical is Finland’s national pastime, where you count one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For the descent to the ground you will not need a separate visa (starting from 2009) using the onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the fears and personal aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding a bit of how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can prove useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or about not having control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some journeys, larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies there were problems.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for unloading and customs.
The only way to get it faster would be to ship it as hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since the regulations of the airlines do not allow you to ship luggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the most obvious way is to shell out a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to shell out up to four times the normal economic rate for business trips and up to eleven times the rate for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is not even worth looking for discounts on first-class seats or in business class.
Airlines know full that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has once been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, the economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important crossroads for transport.
The ancient city of Izmney is spread over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although in the city you can breathe an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than to that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, the buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red tile roofs, the 18th century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
A half hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and charming town of Sintra, easily accessible. She became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant tale of her splendours written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), a place of Marian apparitions famous throughout the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has an almost incalculable meaning for an important part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or worked to the death, both Jewish and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid disfiguring these places by smearing structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers Catalan to speak, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by virtually everyone.
However, most of the signals are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the subway, ordinary ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians are reputed to be self-centered, rude and conceited.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get good in Paris continues to be to behave at its best, relating as a person "bien élevé" (well educated). This will definitely facilitate your travels.
The rough outward appearance of the Parisians will quickly fade if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in woods, mainly beech, berries and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a variety of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels, it has a wide variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and volatile species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the capercaillie, next to several other most widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most of the monasteries make you available stoles for women who come to you unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if in bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or the nun to the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers down to below the knees.
These too can be borrowed at the warehouse at the entrance; however, the clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts you may not feel comfortable. For men, one size for everyone!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is made from bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All the nouns, in addition to the pronoun "Sie" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "Lei", always start with a capital, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form makes writing rather complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they write.
The main letters to be careful are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the voice below.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: dear means beloved, while wagon means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and most often regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in comprehening sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with a minimum knowledge of the Spanish language may come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Premodern observers are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not as much as it is today, they are usually placed in cities or campuses, more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the flowering of the plums was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossoming festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" a specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even picking up some specimens of plants will cost you away from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy-to-turn city; you can buy pretty much anything once you get there.
But being in the "ups tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the heat (always) and the strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie canal.
In addition, they define the paths of hiking trails and well-known bike paths.
Christmas is one of the most important feasts of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions linked to this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an open place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations at the base of this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional churches a Easter Vigil is celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with the congregations that often begin the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands would swim, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, mammals could not face the journey. This caused the giant tortoise to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark almost throughout the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the culture of education that Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing is normally made up of jacket and tie or suit and you turn to colleagues with the surname or with the professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is crucial, as it attaches importance to the group's commitment rather than praising individual accomplishments.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors regarding every decision, and they are expected to stick to the instructions without asking questions.
