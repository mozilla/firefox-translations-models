[Roberto Battiston] Dare, have the courage to go into space.
Space is the object of charm, dream, danger.
What you see is a small solar phenomenon that happened a few years ago: a small spot emitted a large 'burst' of particles, plasma, and sun-spot 1,692, exactly as large as Earth.
What happened in the hours, in the following days: a very large mass of particles, plasma, energy, two days later arrived on Earth and what happened lit the skies of Northern Europe with formidable aurora boreuras, never seen.
But only this has happened, because the Earth is protected from the phenomena around space, a hostile space, by at least three elements: the magnetic field that defuses the particles, our planet that fends us in part and the atmosphere, which is like having two and a half meters of aluminum in front of us that protect us from the particles.
But if we were on a journey to Mars, if we did what we did so many years, from the time of von Brown, we want to do, conquer the Red Planet with astronauts, what would protect us?
How could we be able to resist this and all the other challenges that space offers us?
The space we have conquered: this is the International Space Station, as large as a football field, can accommodate up to nine astronauts.
It is the technological jewel of modern times.
It's something absolutely fantastic.
Samantha Cristoforetti, Luca Parmitano: our astronauts have been hosted for months in this great space hotel where they managed to resist the hostility of space.
But during the mission, to Luca Parmitano, an unpredictable thing happened: a small pump that managed the cooling of the space suit with which Parmitano was walking in space, working outside the Space Station, broke.
He began to lose some liquid: half awls of water that began to float in the helmet, aspirated by the nose and mouth.
He was about to drown in a water awl in space.
Who would have imagined it?
No one.
It was going to happen.
He was saved because the other comrades quickly brought him inside the inhabited space and could get rid of this half-glasses of water in which he was drowning him.
What is it that we miss?
We lack materials that know how to repair themselves, systems that can protect themselves automatically.
Where can we look for this kind of new technology?
[Nicola Fist] Nature is, of course, able to self-repair.
We see it every day: when we get a scratch thank you to the sky, we can then repair ourselves.
Even recently, from the age of the 2000s, from an engineering point of view, we can mimic this characteristic a bit.
The concept is very simple: you can also imagine it by referring to this projection.
Imagine putting capsules inside a traditional material.
These capsules, in turn, contain a sort of glue, so to speak, on microcapsules, there are many widespread everywhere.
When the crack spreads and tends to split my structure also breaks the capsules that release this liquid that goes to sew the crack and therefore, in essence, we have a material that has self-separed.
It's something that already exists.
There are even paints that can self-repair, so if they are scratched they recover on their own.
[Roberto] A very useful technology!
This is part of a more general framework in which we imitate nature.
[Nicola] Well, of course!
Imitating nature is something that has always been done.
Also think of Leonardo’s studies, also about flying.
Observing the flight of birds, we tried to build the first machines to go flying.
Certainly inspiration is important, more than mimiling nature tout-court.
Planes do not slam, for example, the wings, but we have achieved remarkable results that we use, alas, every day.
[Roberto] Very good, then, at this point, it will mean that the next time we have to repair a piece of the Space Station, we look, in this case, a panel that was done, almost 80 meters long, at a certain point showed a crack and the astronaut had to sew and sew up, repair with a huge effort and risk.
It would take more durable materials that do not break, that can resist the hostility of space, folding, opening.
Well, certainly one possibility is to self-feuse, another is that they do not split.
Then, to take inspiration, the most tenacious material, which has the greatest ability to dissipate energy before breaking, is the spider's silk.
The spiders are exceptional: think that even a spider that you find around is able to do up to seven different types of thirst.
Here you see the silk spinning apparatus.
It can therefore produce materials that are either extremely resistant or extremely tenacious, or able to dissipate even more energy with structural solutions that we will then see and are also sticky to block the prey.
They can do some really amazing things.
To give an idea, this material is ten times tougher than Kevlar.
Here you see a junction at the web itself, you have an additional length of silk within a droplet and this further increases the ability to dissipate the energy of the web, the structure.
In doing so, an insect is blocked and so the spider has been able to evolve and survive to this day.
[Roberto] Spider canvas is something extraordinary.
There are very special materials in space.
For example, a helicopter on Mars would need, due to the very small atmosphere compared to the Earth’s atmosphere, of blades that spin much faster, which are much larger and lighter.
We do not know today how to do it: even the most resistant materials such as carbon fiber struggle to resist these very special stresses.
Yes, carbon is actually the fiber we know today, from an engineering, macroscopic point of view, at least, more resistant than ever.
Sei GigaPascal: six times the strength of steel.
Theoretically there is a material that is even more resistant, at least from an ideal point of view, and is a single layer of carbon atoms: the famous, so to speak, graphene.
More layers of this graphene then make the graphite we have in our pencils, not resistant because the planes flow between them, but the single sheet of graphite is extremely resistant.
A resistance of 100 times the steel, at least theoretically.
In this way we can certainly make the blades of a helicopter to go to Mars and it could also have application on Earth.
Many people could not be saved in Nepal, because we did not have helicopters to go below a certain altitude.
But we can also do even more extravagant things such as, for example, a space elevator cable in order to bring mass from Mars to space at very low costs with advantages that we know well because the elevators use them.
[Roberto] But if we wanted, beyond a very strong layer, to have complex structural materials and that we need for a whole range of applications, what has nature done in this area?
[Nicola] Then this is very important.
We use carbon fibers in the materials of other matrices to build composite materials.
When we mismit things, unfortunately, for flaws and many other things, the resistance falls.
In fact, carbon-based composites are not so resistant today.
But there are natural composites.
We recently observed the composite, the biological material with the utmost resistance and found it in the nails of the patelle.
Going to take these elements, trying the tractions, we saw a mechanical resistance of six GigaPascals, that is much greater than the composites that man is now able to do.
[Roberto] Exceptional, we are truly collecting a lot of inputs and suggestions from truly extraordinary nature.
Well, one of the problems we have in space, both in low orbits and in deep travel, are what are called space waste, micrometeorites.
They move so fast at 7, 8, 10 kilometers per second that even a very small object - here we have an example of an inch of a metal ball - banging against 18 centimeters of aluminum thickness practically punctured it, deformed it for the enormous energy that dissipated with a mode that material as such could not absorb.
We would need screens, much more resistant protections.
What can we look towards nature in this regard?
[Nicola] Think of the insects.
Nature has evolved absolutely in this context.
Insect armor is an example.
Here we see in particular a very interesting beetle, the so-called bomber beetle, which manages to emit this fluid at high temperature and at high pressure to get rid of its enemies.
That’s why, you’ve noticed, I got scared before when the drummer emitted these streams, they remembered this thing we’re looking at here.
The beetle has this remarkable peculiarity, because you imagine the material that makes up the internal combustion chamber.
You see, it has this very light structure but it also has this wavy surface and this wavy surface seems to be the key to further withstood explosions, as in this case, but also impacts.
In fact, by making simulations, - you see a scheme of a numerical simulation at the bottom right - we observed that, on paromet of mass, equally of average thickness of this slab, if waved with a certain undulption, the protective capacity becomes much greater.
One might think, tomorrow, to make screens for spaceships to Mars inspired by the bomber beetle.
[Roberto] Exceptional, but another problem we have in space is that we need very large structures and when we start with our missiles by definition can only be folded.
A difficulty for space engineering is to be able to open them, possibly to close them, reliably, taking advantage of lightness, when we are in space, and flexibility and folding when we are still leaving for the Earth.
It’s one of the hardest things to make sure the mechanics develop and gets back in place as much as we want.
From this point of view, what can nature tell us?
[Nicola] Nature can tell us, as always, so much.
You see a simple ladybug.
‘Supid,’ it is so to say, ‘very common’, I would say.
The ladybug can explain the wings without any problem, she manages to fold them.
Imagine the complexity bends them thanks to a system of ribs on the wings, which are also structural for the wings, but which, with a sort of elastic stability, so to speak, manages to open and close in a somewhat discontinuous way, therefore in a very controlled way, these wings.
So we could imagine doing something similar to check the opening and closing of these panels very well.
[Roberto] This is just the technology of the third millennium: we need to make an absolutely extraordinary leap to go and do something that nature has already learned and can do for billions of years.
We went to Mars, we landed: we need resources.
The first resource the astronaut needs is water.
We know that on Mars there is water, ice, under the various layers of the ground, but that there is also an atmosphere.
So some amount of water in the Martian atmosphere has to be there.
If we could recover the water from the atmosphere as we do on Earth, it would be extremely useful.
What could we do, taking inspiration from nature?
[Nicola] There are organisms that can do this.
Think, for example, of the cactus.
Here I would like to bring a different example: it is another beetle, the beetle of Namibia, a desert beetle, which has a surface that is composed of two hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials.
That is, materials that, on the one hand, manage to attract water and, on the other hand, absolutely manage to make it flow very well.
This combination of two types of surfaces within the same macroscopic surface makes it possible to recover a lot of water and therefore manages to survive in desert environments.
[Roberto] Fabulous: beetles that take water from the air.
But, speaking of surfaces, we would need self-cleaning surfaces.
For example, this is one of the rovers on the Martian surface.
After a few months, it was covered with dust: the solar panels, which we see on the left, are completely unusable.
Fortunately, every now and then, beyond the storms there are lighter winds, small whirlwinds that clean up and, fortunately, put it back in place as on the right.
But if we had surfaces that are inherently self-cleaning, which manage to eliminate any form of storage, we would certainly be even more prepared to face an interplanetary journey.
[Nicola] Self-cleaning surfaces in nature are certainly there; the most famous is the lotus leaf, so much so that we speak of lotus effect.
Here you see some droplets of water flowing on this surface.
It gives you the very clear idea of how water-repellent, super hydrophobic, in this sense, and it is a particular surface area, so much so that it is considered sacred by some populations, because, despite living in swamps, in dirty places, it always manages to be very clean.
This is basically thanks to a superficial topology invisible to the naked eye, but which under the microscope is very well highlighted.
A particular topology thanks to which, essentially, the material becomes recently hydrophobic to super hydrophobic, from a chemical point of view.
It is therefore clear that, going to mimic this topology, which today can be done with nanotechnology, we can basically change the properties of ‘wetability’ – that is, of interaction with water – of surfaces.
Here you see, for example, a plastic surface inspired by the lotus leaf that we have made, simply with this topology invisible to the naked eye, the interaction with the fluid changes dramatically.
[Roberto] Exceptional!
One of the things we have seen, an imitation of nature is the famous Velcro.
You remember, it was patented and studied because someone started wondering why in the socks, going into the fields, attach a certain type of seeds of some plants.
Velcro in space is used everywhere to attack and close.
Even the suits that go to the Moon have pieces of velcro to be able to quickly make closures.
But nature on this, it has done much more, hasn't it?
[Nicola] Velcro is extremely interesting.
The main problem with velcro is that you can stick one element on the other, that is, I can hook the hooks to the microanellini that are there.
In nature, of course, something much more sophisticated was needed.
The most sophisticated animal ever, from this point of view, because the largest, has necessarily had to evolve with better adhesive mechanisms ever: it is the gecko, which actually has, within its paw, a number, we also counted them, billions of elements in grip, of two-dimensional structures, each of which exerts a small force that added together make a remarkable adhesive resistance of the gecko.
Just to give an idea, it resists five times an ideal suction cup.
He can also control this adhesion; this is perhaps the most intriguing aspect.
He manages to detach himself with extreme ease, using a little the concept that we use it adjusts when we want to do not get hurt by detaching a patch, that is, changing the angle in which he removes the pegg from the surface.
You might think of gecko-inspired surfaces to move a bit where we want.
[Roberto] We must also explain it to the man-spion who perhaps must become a man-geek to go into space.
Well, there is a problem however of duration and exposure to radiation and the difficulties of the deep vacuum to the heat and cold and even on this nature has given us extraordinary indications.
Both brewer’s yeast, both lichens, and streptococchi, and some complex structures such as plankton, tardigrades, very small animals, but still complex, were put into space, exposed to radiation, vacuum, temperature change, hibernation in a form of letagon and then were awakened after 10, 15, 20 months, finding that some of these individuals are still alive.
It’s amazing what nature has done, because it has never been exposed to these conditions, but nevertheless, some of these animals on Earth have had a chance to develop these characteristics.
But there is an absolutely impossible challenge to overcome: the duration of a space trip!
Mars 6.8 months, but the first 100,000-year star with current launch and travel techniques.
How can we plan to go on such a long journey?
[Nicola] Well, here we can also hope to take inspiration but the challenge is very strong.
But it is to be cited is the only organism that is known to be immortal.
A jellyfish that is called so, immortal jellyfish, which even has the ability to rejuvenate, that is, to return to the state of octopus in particularly adverse conditions.
So it is essentially as if a man in extreme conditions decides to return to a child and then replay his life when the extreme, too adverse conditions had appeared.
It is certainly a very interesting peculiarity and also difficult to mimic.
[Roberto] Now I understand why some science fiction films show polypons that come with spaceships are evidently already informed of this possibility.
In any case, it is clear that interplanetary travel, possibly a tomorrow when we have more effective ways to move, the interstellar one, requires very different technologies to which we are not accustomed and that nature, as you have seen, could give us very interesting stimuli and challenges.
We will probably need new technology tomorrow.
That’s why the challenge of going to Mars is so interesting to improve the technical capabilities of man.
[Nicola] Can't we end like this: when we're going to Mars?
[Roberto] Ah, I don’t know, but I’m sure the man and woman who will be there have already been born.
Oh, thank you.
[Applause]
I work in the digital economy in Europe and Italy, and I was lucky enough to spend part of my career in companies that had its headquarters in California.
I have been active for several years as an angel investor, i.e. investor in start-ups.
For me 2017 was a year with some satisfaction for my work: I received two awards for my business angel activity, one in Italy and one in Europe; in the past two years I was among the "50spiring", the 50 most inspired women in the world of technology in Europe.
I should be in seventh heaven.
But I'm not.
For me, 2017 has been, so far, a year of defeat for women in the world of technology.
Defeats that hurt us, because they come from the same place from which innovation and the future come; a place that is taken as a model and a place where everything that happens has an echo that spreads all over the world.
I'm talking about Silicon Valley.
In 2017, episodes and behaviors that are disconcerting both in themselves and the silence with which they were previously hidden began.
In February 2017, Susan Fowler, recounting her experience as a developer of unwanted sexual attention and rejected in an Uber engineering team, set in motion a chain of events that on June 20 led to the resignation of CEO, Travis Kalanick.
On June 13, at an internal meeting at Uber, businesswoman Arianna Huffington, who is on the company’s board of directors, talks about her desire to co-opt more women on the board.
David Bonderman, his colleague, interrupts her with a sexist joke: "More women, equal more chatter," she says.
The reaction leads Bonderman to resign from office on Uber’s board.
On June 30, the New York Times published a report in which more than two dozen would-be entrepreneurs, including Rachel Renock, reported episodes of sexism in the course of their interactions with venture capital funds they proposed to invest in their companies.
In July Dave McClure, founder of the incubator "500 startups", resigned after admitting improper behavior towards entrepreneurs looking for funding, collaborators and candidates.
In which Sara Kunst, who had told her story to the New York Times.
In August, an internal memo written by a Google employee, James Damore, who criticizes the diversity initiatives in the company claiming that women are biologically unfit to do the work of programmer.
On August 7, Google splits off their working relationship with him; quickly, he becomes the spokesman for a misogynistic and alt-right current of thought in Silicon Valley.
In past years, there have come wonderful things from California: cultural exports such as James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, the Beach Boys, the beat generation, the hippie culture, the black panthers, the punk music of California, Ronald Reagan, Blade Runner, the Mac, the Indiana Jones, the iPhone.
This year we only got poison among men and women.
So much poison.
I will now take a step back in the early 1990s.
At that time, as a new graduate I started my career in a multinational strategic consulting company, in Milan.
I did not have many female role models, on the contrary we can say that I had only one: this is Marisa Bellisario, a graduate in economics in the early 90s.
She worked as a programmer on the first mainframes of Olivetti, then made a commercial career in Olivetti, in General Electric.
In 1981 he became CEO of Italtel: a great company in deep crisis of which, in a few years, completed the turn around.
Conquering the covers of world magazines, it stands out for hairstyles, clothing, it is known that it would have reached further career goals had it not been for the veto placed by some men of power.
In 1988, he died of bone cancer at the age of 53.
So I started my career with just one role model of female manager.
And she wasn't even alive, she was already dead.
Some time ago I came curious to go and see what they do, today, the people who started their careers with me in that same year.
The men are CEO, more than half; general manager; managing director; senior partner; managing partner; chief strategy officer.
The women, no.
Women do, with some important and bright exception, other things.
They took other roads.
I took my own, on the street: I work as an independent advisor and as a business angel, as I told you.
I have held, in my career, roles of responsibility, I have had a lot of satisfaction.
Today I am an independent, a freelancer: I am invited to speak in public about the digital economy, startups, innovation; and even to testify about the success of professional women managers, and to talk about my work, in particular, in Italy and abroad.
But I don't have a top seat.
I have, yes, important responsibilities: but I do not host any power, if not shared and collegial within the councils of which I am a member.
I am an independent, a freelancer.
And so most of the colleagues I met on my path.
So what happened to my generation of women?
What prevented them from achieving the career goals they set themselves in the early 1990s, and what can we do because what happened to us, whatever it is, doesn’t happen to those who come after us?
Why can other women achieve their goals without crashing into a wall?
What are the costs of this state of affairs?
It is well known that the world economy, the well-being of all of us, pays a cost in terms of non-growth due to the absence of women from decision-making from the world of work; according to the OECD we are losing two and a half points of growth, in the next eight years, due to the participation gap.
If we halved it, the world would grow more.
In companies, the lack of diversity in management, correlated with a lower degree of innovation than that found in companies where at least 20% of top managers are women.
But these economic arguments are known and strange, and do not push for change.
Instead, I would like to give you some data on the human costs of the situation in which we are and these costs concern not only women but also men, these men to whom, in the vast majority of cases, we entrust the roles of power in companies, while women entrust other tasks.
We have concrete evidence, for example, of how to decouple masculinity from the role of head of the householder, or income procurer, could have important benefits for women and men.
An American study shows us that if incomes in the couple divaricava, over time, in favor of man, the physical and psychological health of the man is more likely to deteriorate: anxiety and depression increase.
And the effect is even stronger if man remains the only one, of the two, to bring income.
A longitudinal study of 72,000 Swedish men showed that decades after the birth of a child, men who used parental leave for a period of one or two months survived more than their peers who did not, at the same age, education, employment level.
The mortality rate of men caring for their young children was 24 percent lower than that of those who did not.
The experience of caring for newborns seems to have, in fathers, an effect of preventing risky behaviors, especially alcoholism; and it is an effect that lasts for decades to come.
So, what promotes equality at work and at home?
Equal economic opportunities and care tasks?
Unfortunately there is no silver bullet, we can only make a few considerations.
A study of 6,000 Danish companies with a male CEO showed that when the head is born a first-born female daughter the salary gap in the company decreases because women’s wages rise faster than men’s salaries.
This does not occur if the firstborn is a son.
A U.S. study suggests that venture capital funds whose partners have daughters, hire more women.
[And] not only do they hire more women, but they also perform better.
It is clear that asking that those who exercise power in companies have daughters are not a policy lever unfortunately actionable; we cannot force top managers to reproduce or generate these strange beings of sex other than their own.
Perhaps as a suggestion to the girls at their first job, before sending that resume it is worth taking a look at the familiar composition of those who sit in the button room.
What does all this mean?
That gender stereotypes, which are there and are there in front of everyone’s eyes, do not only hurt women.
Stereotypes are cages: a cage a little wider and more comfortable and comfortable for men, a narrower and limiting cage for women, and an even closer one for transgender, intersex and binary people.
So stereotypes really hurt everyone.
They hurt us women who accept to be seen as the queens of multitasking and to leave much of the power, too, to men.
As a result, we still suffer a wage gap, we make less career, accumulate less wealth and less savings, we are less autonomous.
And the prejudice against us seems to be alive in the millennial generation as much as in that of their parents.
But stereotypes are also bad for men, because masculinity can become a trap.
From childhood we socialize males as incomplete children who can express a range of limited emotions.
If a child wants to play football, or loves cars, now we understand that it's okay, we let them be a bit of a tomboy.
But if a child loves classical dance, we still treat him like Billy Elliot in the 80s.
We grow, therefore, these male children also in their cage of stereotypes of masculinity.
We send them to school, then go to work and we expect them to be the family’s economic engine.
With their baggage of stereotypes, and with ours.
When a woman leaves work away from home to devote herself to her children, which tragically happens much more than she should, she has all our solidarity.
Let's say: look what a good mom, look what heroine, what sacrifices she made to raise her children.
In the few cases in which, on the other hand, it is a man who makes this decision, to stay at home with his children, perhaps because the woman earns better than him, we punish him forcedging him as weak and inadequate.
This double standard is very dangerous.
The stereotype is bad for everyone: women, men and society as a whole.
My feeling is that elsewhere women are moving a little faster than in the West.
For example, in China, coming out of the stereotype, 55 percent of digital startups are founded by women.
How many of us are?
And women in China are partners in 80% of venture capital funds.
They decide on which initiative to invest.
They are on the march, they move, they move on: we here, in the West, have the feeling of standing still, or almost millimeterly advancing and, occasionally, going back.
Because even in very innovative environments, where the future is produced, it is as if women and men in the world of work were separated by a large canyon.
And from this canyon came the summer of poisons, which I told you about just now.
There is an air of defeat, there is a lot of bitterness for trying to win without having taken into account that the dice were rigged.
It is enough to make me want to give up dialogue, to return to such, to lock ourselves up among those who understand us, to cut off bridges.
But I am convinced that, more than ever, it is time to build bridges: building bridges between women and men to meet halfway and to give hands.
Make an effort together: Now is the time to challenge the canyon that divides women and men.
What does it mean in concrete terms?
I would not like to repeat the recipes already known, such as the need, for companies, to activate a different organization of work; or how the voluntary effort of doing it forward, of lean-in, which is largely always at the expense of women.
Today I have three new recipes for you that all have to do with building bridges: a personal, a media and a policy.
The first is personal: hygiene, in the working environment, is your responsibility.
I speak of hygiene of behaviors: if you are a man, you must know that at work, every day, a thousand things happen: interruptions, jokes, comments, words spoken in half voice, ideas generated by one person and attributed to another, that to a woman they make the effect of a thousand cuts in the skin made with the edge of a sheet of paper.
And of which you men often do not even notice.
Sit down with a woman and ask her, if and when it happens, to let you notice it, in a discreet but effective way, as it happens.
With a gesture, with a glance, with a signal agreed in advance.
Take, then, aside the men who interrupted, teased, excluded or belittled a woman and explain to them that this, in 2017, is no longer acceptable.
If you are a woman, however, you do not unnecessarily exhaust your energies by keeping your frustration inside, or trying to explain these things on its own.
Find a man ally, build a bridge with him, and make him work there.
The second recipe is the media: look critically at the role messages that surround us.
Your children’s school textbooks are full of stereotypes, even today, in 2017.
Dad and moms, look at these texts.
Not just moms.
Talk to the teachers and have the most appropriate texts adopted in the times in which we live.
Television, advertising, are always part of the media environment that surrounds us.
And we are not just talking about the classic woman who has to disappear from our screens without ifs and without buts.
Let’s talk about those cages made of stereotypes that in 2018 will have to stop existing in the UK because the Authority for Standards in the Advertising world has decided to put in place new anti-stereotype guidelines.
They can be sanctioned, for example, advertisements in which the whole family puts in disarray and only the mother puts back in order; those in which a typical activity of girls presents itself as not suitable for boys, or vice versa; those in which a man is teased because he tries in vain, and without succeeding, to carry out the tasks of caring for the home or family.
Do we want ads without these stereotypes?
Well, let's make our voices, women and men heard.
This includes the creatives in agencies, the clients of advertising campaigns, the decision-makers inside the companies and all of us consumers.
The third recipe is the political one: there is a big taboo that we must eradicate in Italy and that is that parental leave must be reserved for women.
True, whenever you try to give men an extra day of 100% paid paternity leave, the public coffers cry; but the habits do not change by giving up days with the dropper.
Habits are changing all over the world: in companies like Facebook, which all its employees offer, when they become fathers, up to 4 months of paternity leave; or Spotify, which offers 6.
But outside the big successful companies that can afford to have these parity policies, what can we do?
We have a great resource, in Italy: after compulsory leave, optional parental leave: today it is six months, paid only partially and available only to the mother.
It is politically possible, if we make an alliance between men and women, to institute optional bipartisan leave: three months for one parent, three months for the other, without being able to be exchanged or sold.
In this way women would return to work first, very much benefit; fathers would find themselves learning the work of care and perhaps, like the Swedes, to live longer; and third, the whole society would work better.
In an ideal world, men and women with a new baby would be home for the same time.
No one in the company would ever be denied an assignment, a project, a promotion, a pay raise because he could have a child.
We can no longer afford to be no longer men and women that we are not feminists.
Building bridges is the only way to unravel the world we live in.
With the three recipes I told you about today, we could go a long way.
That’s why I leave you with the words of a man who speaks as a feminist.
Oh, thank you.
(Applause) [English: It is critical that everyone understands] [that men can not only,] [but they should be feminists.]
[And I’m proud to be] [Being a feminist, to me, is to recognize] [that men and women should, they can, must have equal rights.]
[And second, that there is still a huge work to do.]
[He for She is a United Nations-sponsored movement] [to which I hope all of you adheras, [of men in defense of women.]
[Omen who close in the bud those offensive conversations] [who are born in the locker room, and in a camaraderie culture].
[We need to know we can be better than this!]
[The way we treat our sisters, girlfriends,] [cousin, mothers, and the world around us] [Count!]
[We must rediscover the true sense of manhood] [which is openness, respect, compassion] [and the courage to defend all this!]
(Applause)
Holy Father, I started writing to you two years ago.
An advanced spring morning, in a village in the Langhe, with the cobblestone streets spiraling up to the square.
On the square a castle and an ancient church as there are many, in Piedmont.
From that square, the valley opens to breakneck, at the bottom, the hills covered with woods: chestnut and hazelnuts, at the bottom, the vineyards and the corn fields.
The beauty of the Langhe, there the extraordinary beauty of the landscape coexists with the horror of certain families, my: bourgeois, in the indifference of many.
Holy Father, my name is Ginevra, I am 40 years old, I am originally from Turin I grew up there and I attended high school.
After I met the man who was going to become my husband, it was autumn.
It came from the Langhe, Cuneo, a young slender, with beautiful manners.
He had just enrolled in Medicina in Turin, Corso Massimo d'Azeglio.
That day the mists of the Po went up in the park, the air was drunk, we looked at each other and we were happy.
A dream that remained in blood.
He graduated, specialized, married, a lavish marriage.
I moved to your country.
First son: Matthew, gift of God.
Then Peter and Luke, the twins.
Peter is the stone on which Jesus bases his Church, Luke is the light, the favorite of Our Lady, St. Luke is the patron of doctors.
Franscesque: green eyes and blond curls, elusive degard... looks like me.
My kids are beautiful.
They have that healthy complexion of those who live in the countryside.
At the foot of the Langhe, at the confluence of two rivers, 300 meters above sea level.
Once, stop for travelers and pilgrims on the ancient salt route that connected Albenga to Alba.
We live in a large farmhouse, during the day, the children play barefoot in the grass and jump for joy, the night sing the crickets.
Andrea is the heir of a wealthy family, masters of a palace in the city and a beautiful seaside villa in San Remo.
The family of him is known in our village, makes many donations to the church, and on Sunday he always shows himself at Mass in the wooden bench in the front row with the name of the family on it.
As a young man he took the time to travel, but instead of marrying a village girl, a girl accustomed to country life, she chose me.
Torinese, a foreigner in Cuneo’s, slender and blonde like certain others he had met in the world.
Unfortunately, our beautiful story ends here.
My husband does not have the moral virtues of King Arthur, when he returned to live in the country he changed.
It will be the peasant culture, masculine, will be the friends at the bar, for them women do not count, they are made to serve them.
The fact is that Andrea has become violent he has been beating me for twelve years, now he also uses violence on children.
In the surroundings there is no Lancelot able to save us, ours is not a degraded situation, like certain peripheries: far from it.
Andrea is primary, he earns well.
Of course, with me he is not generous: he gives me a few euros a time, in the evening he claims the receipts of the grocer, from the butcher he passes at the end of the month, but, after all, the money is there.
The other night Andrea kicked me, I was too tired, I couldn't resist the pain, I shouted.
The little girl woke up from overhead slipping on the stairs and saw me on the ground as her father hit me.
The next morning, at school, she burst into tears, the teacher hugged her, she had everything told, she was surprised: she has always known Andrea.
She never expected her to be violent.
But children don't lie.
The teacher summoned me, said she was going to talk to him.
I begged her not to, we risk being killed, the child and me.
For now, I don't feel like rebelling, I can't leave this beautiful house, to move with my four kids to a small apartment.
And my husband is Catholic, he doesn’t want to separate.
My parents are Catholic, practitioners.
They live in the city, I don’t see them often.
My mother sensed something, but I don't want to sad her with my problems, I already know that a divorced daughter wouldn't like her.
In reality I do not want to leave Andrea, I do not want to go to the Carabinieri, as I recommend a friend, a high school class, the only one I hear from time to time.
It would be like cheating on him.
Maybe I'm wrong, it all seems so strange.
When I met him, Andrea was kind, he is also kind now: he fills me with beatings, then he hugs me, he says he loves me.
It happens often.
If they lean, obviously he does the dressing, he does not want to go to the emergency room, everyone knows him there.
The family often, instead of being the image of love, becomes a place of tranquil cruelty.
The other day I went home, I found myself in front of Andrea's mother as a young manesca was a manesca, she beat her husband, the children, in the house she does not speak Italian, uses the dialect.
In that rough language, a few nights ago he incited Andrea to beat me.
Then it was she, my mother-in-law, who sent me away, away from home, the children looked, astonished.
Maybe it’s because here oxen and people are all race, I’m from Turin, I’m from a good family, bourgeois.
She would have preferred a girl from here, the ones who are in the house and say nothing.
On Sunday I went to confession, Don Paolo says that I have to be patient, to endure.
The people tried by the greatest sufferings are God-preferred, Jesus said.
I don’t have to complain, the family is sacred, you can’t dismember.
Of course it is difficult to remain united, if you are not all respectful of each other, but here at stake there is not only respect, there is violence, violence severs love.
After beating me, Andrea goes to confession, repents and the priest grants him forgiveness.
Then he falls back, comes back to beat me and Don Paolo forgives him again.
He's a country priest, my mother-in-law brings him chickens and rabbits, stories of the past.
Andrea means "man."
Holy Father, in the Mass at the beginning of the pontificate you said that every man must be the guardian of himself and of others.
Andrea was watching Mass, on TV, then it was enough for a pretext to beat me again, in front of the children: it became normal, even for me.
I stand in silence, staring at my man turned upside down.
I have made four children, but here women are like then: they make children, and they don’t count for anything.
I'm full of bruises, I'm hiding the cheekbone wound with a little trick I have to do something for them, for my children, the eldest started raising their hands.
Holy Father, I heard her on the radio, while she was talking about the first believers, I would like to ask her for help.
Perhaps it would be enough for his word to put an end to so much violence, violence disguised as love, I have heard.
But maybe it wouldn't help.
What can be said that has not already been said?
Unless you, Holy Father, decide to speak to priests, to those like Don Paolo, because they do not grant forgiveness to men like my husband so easily.
The Church forgives, where she feels sincere repentance because a repentance only formal serves to return to the sacraments but also to the usual violence.
You have to show repentance, try to correct yourself.
In the face of fiction the priest cannot, and must not absolve.
Holy Father, I wrote to you a couple of years ago but you had just gone up to the papal throne, it was the wrong time.
You already know, my name is Ginevra, I am Piedmontese like your grandfather Giovanni and your great-grandfather Francesco.
I live in Turin, beautiful, ancient, when in the evening he becomes a star in front of a great chorus of people.
Turin means Naples that goes to the mountains, Turin: straight roads, it is the other side of the same Rome, Turin, a city sick with melancholy, so Venditti sings it.
We live in a condominium in Corso Francia, a straight: it starts from Piazza Statuto, Porta Susa and leads to France, to Chambéry.
Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy in 1711, connected the Royal Palace with the residence of Rivoli.
During the Second World War, when Italy entered the war against France, the city authorities changed its name, Gabriele D'Annunzio, in progress.
After the war returns to be Corso Francia Today the subway passes under it: nine stops.
At the beginning of Corso Francia there are many beautiful villas, Art Nouveau style, early twentieth century.
We live a little further, towards Rivoli, on the outskirts of Turin.
Employees live in my apartment building.
Early in the morning they run to work.
The one I live is not my home.
It's the house where I grew up, my parents' house.
They are elderly, they left me their furnished apartment and moved to the countryside.
Now, leave you tell you how I found the courage to go to the Carabinieri and denounce Andrea.
There I didn't want to.
Francesca was in fourth grade when her father kicked me on the carpet.
The next morning, he told the teacher everything.
Worried, the teacher wanted to go to Andrea, talk to him.
It wasn't good for the little girl to tell the story about that.
I begged her not to say anything, she would have beaten us, me and the child.
I made my decision.
For Francesca.
Today it is on first average.
After talking to the teacher I went to the Carabinieri and to the First Aid.
They ascertained the bruises, it was not the worst time, I had been beaten much worse.
But it was enough to press charges.
A few weeks later I went to a law firm, in Turin I relied on a lawyer for the criminal case, another for the civil case.
I didn't ask for state patronage, I wanted a trusted person.
I spent everything I had in lawyers.
A huge sacrifice.
Now Andrea spends 500 euros a month for each of our children.
He should have given me more, he's rich, but the properties are in the name of his mother.
He doesn’t care if the kids no longer have the same opportunities as before.
He doesn't care about the sacrifices I make to pay for the English course, violin.
The boys have changed their lives, give up many things, attend public school, and yet they do not complain.
They never said they wanted to go back to the country, to their father.
They do not regret that old farmhouse, with vaulted ceilings, frescoed, terrace, those beautiful arches.
Part-time work, secretary, in a museum, 900 euros per month.
In short, the expenses are many, even if I pay only 500 euros of rent, a symbolic amount, are retired teachers, some health problems, if they are doing it, but I can not expect more.
They already do a lot, and they don’t have great availability.
They are Catholics, practitioners, and after the many reservations they finally accepted that I left my husband and asked for separation.
And to think that two years ago I was being patient, turning the other cheek.
My brothers, on the other hand, just can not accept my choice.
They live outside of Turin, I see them infrequently.
I know that the time at my disposal is about to end, Holy Father, Let me tell you the reactions of Andrea and his family: when I left, he was very bad.
Now he's the part of the pre-worshipped of the honor, and I'm going crazy.
The week is in a white coat at the First Aid, the Saturday volunteer at the Green Cross and occasionally with the elderly.
Sunday in the church.
I am the one who made it all up.
He sued me.
In court five cases open.
To have taken it worse is my mother-in-law: a proud, wounded in pride, thought that the silence would protect everyone.
For her I am a witch, to be sent to the asylum: she does not understand how she could raise her head, give up my life as a lady to live in an unrenovated suburban apartment.
I just gave the white, everything was kept.
Few clothes, I had no jewels, he never gave me.
The round of pearls?
I have a gift of my mother for the eighteenths, in Piedmont he uses like this.
In the village I am no longer back, it is Andrea’s territory.
In that house I can not even enter to take my things I ran away, two years ago, it was June, the schools were about to end, I did just in time to pick up the report cards.
One evening Andrea was on guard in the hospital.
I took the children and left, in Turin, 80km on the old car that Andrea had returned, a few months later through lawyers.
In the country we left no friends, neither I nor the boys: they were isolated, the father never wanted anyone home.
It wasn't easy but I did it, we made it.
Holy Father, I'm not asking you anything, I just wanted to tell you how it went, that's all.
In the church?
I go there, every Sunday, I bring my children They were used to that beautiful ancient church: after Mass, while the bells rang to the party, we went out to the square, look on the Langhe.
Now we go to the neighborhood parish, to Corso Francia.
It's not the same thing, but that's okay.
I talked about these events with a priest, I met him by chance, on the train he left a mark.
His name was Father Carlo Caroglio, he said that one should not suffer violence was a city priest, modern, originally from Alexandria, he had lived for a long time in Novara, before becoming a priest he had studied as a chemical expert, as you did.
Don Carlo was different from the priest of the country, what Andrea still says: "You don't have to feel guilty if your wife has left you, a wife who abandons you doesn't like you, it's she who has to be ashamed, she's not worthy of you."
Andrea took me af barrel, then went to the priest, said he was sorry, and the priest absolved him.
For this, Andrea feels on the side of the right.
Holiness I have nothing else to say to you, there's no more time.
I trust in your kindness and understanding.
I only ask you one thing: make sure that the priests don't always absolve violent men.
My best wishes, Geneva.
(Applause)
I'll tell you a story.
A few weeks ago, I accompanied my daughter, 10 years old, named Ilaria, to school.
But I wasn't dressed like that, so I didn't have a shirt and jacket.
My daughter, with the curiosity typical of 10-year-old girls, makes me: popes, you don't go to work today.
I do it: no, today I actually work from home.
She looks at me and says, well, you probably won't get anything important to do.
(Laughter) And that made me think a little.
It made me think how much, in fact, we ourselves contribute to creating prejudices in our children.
Because I will tell you that, in fact, according to my way of seeing, work is not a place where you go.
Work is changing, it is changing profoundly.
I will tell you some things that go to support my thesis.
It is changing because there are increasingly rare skills, but increasingly in demand from the market and companies.
A BCG study has certified that about 30 percent of high-tech positions will be vacant in the next 18-24 months due to lack of skills.
You imagine: 30 percent of positions will remain uncovered due to lack of skills, especially in the world of data science and machine learning, so the most modern, more advanced skills.
So, from this point of view, we are a little struggling to build the skills we want to see in our organizations of the future.
We'll chase them.
Another interesting fact is that about 66 percent of CIOs, the IT infrastructure managers of companies, say that the scarcity of talent is approaching crisis dimensions, so it is becoming a very strong issue.
Another very important element: Artificial intelligence and automation and robotization are changing the world of work.
Always the same study of BCG, which I invite you to go to read, is called: "12 forces that are changing the way organizations work" has certified that, in the next 10 years, 70% of the professions that we make today will be drastically changed or even disappear.
And, if we look at what the World Economic Forum says, two-thirds of children who study in primary school today are preparing for jobs that don’t exist yet.
Impressive, if I think of my children who attend primary school today.
Another theme: the average life of some skills, of some engineering skills, has dropped drastically and today is between two and a half years and five years.
What does that mean?
That if a person does not put in mind to invest in himself and to play the game of continuous learning will be, in a short time, little "employable", not very employable.
But there are also some slightly softer forces that are changing the world of work.
For example, having a strong culture within the organization.
The fact that about 90 percent of companies consider culture a distinctive and competitive factor for the organization’s success is certainly a very important, very important thing.
And, from this point of view, there is correspondence.
Because even the people who live the organizations are putting culture and the sense of purpose at the center of their journey.
Sixty-two percent of millennials don't want a job, they don't want a salary, they don't want office work.
He wants to have a career that has a strong social impact.
And, this is my judgment, it’s probably not only millennials who want a trade, a career that helps them have a strong social impact.
Another soft force that is changing the world of work is the increasing focus on the world, the theme of diversity and inclusion.
In the United States, 80 percent of people employed in organizations say it is a factor in choosing their position and the company that organizations focus on diversity.
And 72 percent of the same people say they are willing to leave the organization they work for for an organization that is more inclusive and more attentive to diversity.
So, it is becoming an element of attraction to talent.
It’s becoming such a strong issue that McKinsey has done a study that has shown that there is a 15 percent more likely, for companies that seriously invest in diversity and inclusion, to achieve financial success.
So, it’s not just something nice to work on.
It is a differential factor for the economic results of the organization.
Finally, work, and this is probably the center of reasoning, is increasingly fluid and flexible.
There are - there is the explosion of co-working spaces.
In Italy we have some great success stories on this issue.
Smart working has become a theme at the heart of business strategies.
The smart working observatory of the Politecnico di Milano claims that now most of the companies in Milan have adopted smart working strategies.
And then there is another theme, just as important: skills are forming in places where, until a few years ago, it was unthinkable to see them.
Think of how many graduates there are coming out of the computer engineering pathway in India or China.
And this is forcing organizations to rethink their strategies.
If, until yesterday, organizations put an office where it made sense to put it and then attracted talent, today the same organizations are questioning themselves, they are wondering if this strategy is really the right one.
And they’re putting the locations where the talent is.
The explosion of jobs, especially in terms of technological content, in India is very strong in recent years.
The work is increasingly fluid and flexible: it is increasingly normal, increasingly common to see a work team where the boss is based in Washington and the five members of his staff are based in Caracas, Madrid, Greece, Shanghai or Sydney, perhaps on 5-6 different timezones.
So, from this point of view, you still need the office?
I have my doubts.
I have my doubts because, as I said, in a world of work that is changing in a very strong way, in which skills are increasingly scarce, war for talent is increasingly strong, the world in which artificial intelligence, automation are changing the way organizations work, in a world where the issues of the sense of purpose and the diversity of inclusion are falling back to the center, in a powerful way, of the company strategies, which are not flexible.
And so, here, my idea, very simple, very clear: helping our children to overcome prejudices, to question them.
And to remove them, if they have any.
Because the world of work is changing, the world of work will be characterized by an activity that is always done with more passion, more and more with more sense, with more and more desire to put at the center that theme of continuous learning that I have tried to represent.
And then our purpose is this: to talk to our children about this issue, to talk about how, from a practical point of view, work cannot be a physical space, it cannot be the office.
We don’t “go to work,” even if we say it often.
We do, a job.
And so, my point is exactly that: work must necessarily be our story to our children.
Something you do, certainly not a place where you go.
Oh, thank you.
(Applause)
Good afternoon, good afternoon to all.
Today I take you into my world.
I’ll tell you about the diversity in the blockchain world.
But let’s take a step back: what is blockchain?
Blockchain is a new layer, level, Internet that has fundamental characteristics: it is open, incorruptible, immutable, transparent and decentralized.
It is commonly called the web 3.0.
If the web 1.0 was the era in which companies communicated directly with users, and precisely there was a communication, let’s call it, bidirectional: companies promoted, perhaps, their products on the Internet; and users bought directly on e-commerce; and the era of web 2.0, instead, was the era in which users began to interact with each other, to exchange information and data on blogs, on social media, etc.
We know that this technology will have an impact in many industries, not only in the world of finance; and we know that we must get ready.
We do not know when this will happen, but we know that we must not only arrive prepared in terms of products but also of workforce, in fact, which constitutes, builds this new world, this new technology.
For example, in my company we believe in this vision of the 'tokenization' of everything, in the so-called "tokenization of everything."
That is, we think that any asset, any form of value, a tomorrow – whether it’s a home, a machine, a precious metal, a luxury object, a work of art – can be transformed, digitized into a token that can then be traded on this blockchain, on this new technology.
To give you some examples, imagine the companies that work in the textile sector or in the food industry, which can thus control all the processes of the supply chain in terms of, for example, anti-counterfeiting; or we think of art lovers, who cannot afford to buy a painting, for example Andy Warhol, but can invest in a fraction of that work of art and can exchange this fraction, this token, with other fractions of works of art.
But if we know that blockchain is a technology that will impact everyone’s daily life, through many products, the workforce that composes it must reflect this technology, it must be able to speak to everyone.
Today I will talk about diversity, so what I represent a bit in my world.
And to tell you I looked for the definition: I wanted to arrive with a beautiful definition of diversity, in reality I found many, one different from the other, because we hear about it in many keys.
It is linked to sexual orientation, ethnicity, socio-economic background.
In my opinion, the best definition of diversity in a business key is the ability to create a workforce where everyone, whoever they are, feels welcomed first and feels that they are contributing to the construction of the future of this company.
Intuitively, we know that diversity is a positive factor: now there are also researches that show us, with data, actually, that companies that implement, in fact, this characteristic, this factor, in all levels of their management, from top management down, also have greater financial return.
And this suggests that it is not only about gender diversity, man or woman, but all the differences we have mentioned before.
But why does this happen?
Why are companies with more diversity success in the market?
Because they can listen more to what happens out there, they develop a different sensitivity to understanding what, in fact, consumers want.
At what point, however, at this historical moment, of the diversity in the world of technology, of technical companies, which then concern my world, but not only?
At Circle, my company, we actually wanted to understand, in fact, the interest of women in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, more specifically, which are our field.
So we did a survey, in the United States, which is one of our markets, out of more than 3,000 people, in a range of 24 to 74 years.
Guess what?
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are of interest to males, millennials, whites.
This is the state of the facts.
And the results we have achieved, crossed with other research, other surveys, are always the same: there is about five percent, indicatively - think, only a five percent of women who make up the workforce of this area, who are founders of blockchain companies, investors, enthusiasts, engineers.
What I want to tell you today is that to work in the world of blockchain you don’t need to be 20-year-old nerds, who are all day in front of a computer and have a degree in engineering, they are passionate about finance, investments.
For example, think of me: today I briefly tell you about my journey, because I think it is no coincidence that I have sought this kind of innovation and technology.
I come from a completely different area.
I come from the world of sharing economy, I have not studied engineering, nor science: I studied economics, and then I did marketing.
By study, and for work, I lived a little around the world, in the sense that I have always been, since I was a child, an early adopter, I call myself that.
I was always the first one who wanted to try something new, that wanted to find out what was the innovation that would then be successful, shortly thereafter.
And I was lucky, because my first example - I grew up alone with my mom.
So my family was made up of me, my mom and my little dog.
And she always has me - instead of tie me up, holding me, has always urged me to try, do, go.
And so I did, in the sense that before, from the province - I grew up in the middle of the Piedmontese fog, I spent my first 19 years there - then from the province I went to Milan to study.
After three years of Milan - which was my dream, it seemed to me an unattainable thing - Milan was already mine, and it was time to continue for the next adventure.
And so I lived, in fact, for several reasons, study, work, in New York, in London and in Paris.
When I was entering the world of work, the tech wave of startups was just coming to Europe.
And I immediately realized that I wanted to be part of that area there.
And although it was much riskier than working in the big multinationals already started, I wanted to do that thing there.
I wanted to find economic models that would impact the lives of millions of people when people still didn’t realize it.
And so I discovered there was a small, then, Californian company that was looking for the first people to open the European market: they were at the time 100 people in all, in the company.
So I sent my CV, and you think, after two hours they answered me.
After a week I was hired.
And along with two other guys, we opened Uber’s Italian market.
At Uber I worked for four years, it was an experience, for me, decisive and beautiful, honestly.
After four years of the Italian market, I said: now I want to try another challenge.
Send me to India, I want to work in an emerging market that has a whole different scale compared to Italy, I want to see what happens there, how this technology moves there.
I arrive in India, I live in Mumbai a few months and there I hear, for the first time, talk about blockchain, which I honestly did not know before.
I start to get passionate.
So I understand, I feel it, I say: here, we go again.
Now that the sharing economy is an established, successful model that is impacting all areas of the world, I want to stand out, I want to try again this new technology, this new innovation, in which no one still believes.
And so I start looking for companies that operate mainly in this sector, and I come across my current.
I sincerely tell you that I was a bit hesitant, because I said: sure that I find myself a team of tech-loving males who handcuff around the computer all day.
And I'm not having a mace in there.
They make me the selection process, and in the selection process I fall madly in love with my company and my colleagues.
I cross first my head, which is my myth; and then I cross many women who have key roles in the company, from the Europe manager of communication to the head of Europe in the legal world.
And so these two factors: the selection process, in which I feel absolutely welcomed and I understand that there is the right space for me; and in addition the innovation factor, I wanted to be among the first to try, to find that thing, certainly pushes me to become part of this world.
But let’s take a leap back: the world is composed of 50 percent women and 50 percent men, in fact.
And we know that technology - what is the ultimate goal of technology?
Solving everyone’s daily problems.
As a result, it goes without saying that companies, even the workforce that creates these products, must reflect this gender mix.
I believe that companies, but not only, even institutions, have a key role in this.
Let’s start from institutions, from education: how there are courses for children related to the world of computer science, but not only: MBA, masters with classes, competitions dedicated to computer science, there should be, also, for the world of blockchain and technology.
I want to tell you this episode, which is nice and, destiny wants, it happened to me the other night while I was writing this speech, and then I said: I have to tell it.
There was a television program, "The TV of the girls," and there was Amalia Ercoli Finzi, who I discovered to be the first Italian woman with a degree in space engineering, which told a very simple and very interesting thing for me.
He said: to the girls you have to give the Meccano and a doll.
But not because all girls have to become engineers: this will not happen.
But if one of them wants to become an engineer, he must know that he can do it.
To tell you about this episode, I looked for gender, the feminine declination of the word engineer.
And I found that there are words that do not provide female gender: for example, the word surgeon, the word engineer, the word mayor, think a little.
This is, let’s say, the role that institutions have, for example, about education: to include dedicated courses, and giving the girls the opportunity to discover this world, to approach immediately.
What is the role of companies?
Well, certainly, to expose their female leadership: let's show them, these women.
We do interviews with them, let us explain them to them in the media.
We show that behind the success of these companies there are women, young people, who have traveled all over the world, who have impressive resumes.
And on the other hand, surely, the selection processes are transformed.
This, in my opinion, is a very interesting research that HP has done.
Think that a woman is applying, an application, to a role if she feels 100 percent in line with that role; a man makes an application at a position if he feels at 60 percent in line with that role.
Imagine, in my fintech sector, how difficult it is: we combine finance and technology, which are par excellence two sectors, two male areas.
How difficult it is to attract valid candidate women, who potentially can make careers, can be instrumental in writing the white canvas of this technology.
And the approach to the cv also changes.
The hp no longer becomes the backbone of the selection process, but it is up to the human resource to identify what is the appetite, the talent of that person, looking at the most, perhaps, in the "soft skills" than in the "hard skills".
Maybe it has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, or blockchain on the resume – as in my case, I had nothing to do with it.
Or maybe in his spare time he is an investor, he is an investor in the world of cryptocurrencies, maybe he has already informed himself for his passion, for his interest.
So, this is what we, as companies, must propose to do.
What about us individuals?
What is our role?
Well, I brought you to my world today, I told you this reality that is made up of men, women.
You think I had five bosses in all: three women and two men, one of whom was black and homosexual.
And for me I am - I aspire to be like them: that is, they are not a source of inspiration, more.
What you can do, however, from tomorrow each of you must start to inquire: you do not have to apply, but start chewing the material, start to understand what it is.
Maybe you discover passionate, maybe you start to take an active role and not simply, passively, this revolution when this will happen in the lives of all of us.
Because it will happen, and it will have an even bigger impact, even deeper than what the Internet has had, for 20 years now.
What I encourage to do to everyone - if I had to tell a student who has just left the university, but also to you, I would say: take a backpack, kick us in a shirt and go to Asia, where this world is already very started.
Start going to events, aperitifs, meetups.
He begins to understand what it is.
And do a bit like this little girl behind me, who throws herself, in total unconsciousness but also amused, on this new medium that she does not know, following her predisposition, in fact.
And you enjoy this adventure.
And that's what I encourage you to do, and in short, everyone.
To do that now, right now.
Oh, thank you.
(Applause)
﻿He is Juan, he is an indigenous Kaqchikel who lives in Guatemala.
An indigenous Mayan, Kaqchikel.
And like the vast majority of the indigenous Kaqchikel, they cultivate corn.
The Maya believe they are made of corn.
Their god, Huracan, of the Popol Vuh, which is their holy book, creates them from the corn paste.
So Juan, every year, before the dry season, sows corn.
Every year, he needs $500 to buy the seeds, $600 that they are to buy pesticides associated with those seeds, and $900 to buy fertilizers associated with those seeds.
They call it “full technology package,” they sell it to you like this.
A technology package that includes seeds, pesticides and fertilizers for the price of $2,000.
Obviously, Juan doesn't have $2,000 and he has to go to the bank to get them, that $2,000.
When he finally delivers, he will sell corn and have to bring the money back to the bank, he will have already become 2,400.
The problem is that when it goes to sell corn, in Guatemala, there is a free trade agreement between Guatemala and the United States, so goods produced in Guatemala and the United States circulate freely between these two countries.
So when Juan goes to sell corn, he has to compete with the corn produced in the United States, where it is produced like this.
Thanks to hyper-mechanized, industrialized, and large-scale farming agriculture, they in the United States manage to produce corn at an infinitely lower price than Juan produces.
The price at the quintal of corn has dropped so much that Juan now sells it at $10 per quintal: it’s 10 cents per kilo.
But the vintage went well, Juan managed to produce 50 quintals of corn.
So he will earn $5,000, which when we take away the 2,400 he will have to return to the bank means $2,600 for the entire harvest.
It means $220 a month.
But Juan still holds a part of that corn for himself, and then he also has a small vegetable garden and a few chickens.
Thanks to all this he manages to guarantee himself, his wife and his three children 1,700 kcal a day.
These 1,700 kcal a day, which for us could be a perfect low-calorie diet, to throw down the bacon in view of the summer, for Juan mean losing 1 kg per month, every month.
12 kg per year, every year.
It's called malnutrition.
In Guatemala, 22 families own 76% of the land.
9.5 million farmers share what remains.
The appreciations are so small that they can’t produce who knows how much, and this makes Guatemala the tenth worst-fed country in the world.
2,244 kcal is the average in Guatemala.
The average.
These include people in cities, including waste, waste, include the rich fats that live in cities and include millions of farmers who don’t get to those 2,000-literally fat calories, and they’ll never get there.
According to the World Bank, 49.8% of Guatemalan children under the age of five are malnourished.
According to this World Bank study, 72% of Guatemalan households had to sell assets last year in order to buy food.
Assets, this word used by the World Bank that may seem to us as a tool of high finance, for a farmer, an asset means a hoe, a shovel, a plow.
It means selling work items to buy food.
So what does Juan do?
He sees a future, he sees something different.
He sees advertising signs advertising a crop that could guarantee him to earn much more, and it’s sugar cane.
A U.S. company produces biodiesel in Guatemala.
It would directly lend him $3,000, so the debt is higher.
But that same company guarantees him that he will buy him corn at the end of the year, at $6,000.
The gain, for Juan, increases from 220 to 250 dollars a month.
It looks like the business of the year.
He's trying, Juan.
It throws itself on the sugar cane.
The problem is that then at the end of the year it no longer has corn, and what seemed like a perfect business turns out to be a fiasco.
And so, from 1,700 its calories fall to 1,600.
No longer 12 kg per year, but 15.
He can't do it, he can't do it.
So what do you do?
He decides to sell his piece of land to the same company that will produce sugarcane on a large scale, and then sell biodiesel.
He sells his piece of land at about $7,000.
It is a good piece of land, for Guatemala, in a fertile area, in the plains.
He also sells his house, [is] about $6,000 what he gets from the house.
And then he borrows again for $10,000.
With this $23,000, he will pay for a coyote, a human trafficker, who will take him and let him through Mexico, on this train that throughout Latin America is known as “The Beast”: the train on which thousands of migrants travel on.
They leave, who flee their countries to reach the United States.
Juan will travel in inhumane conditions for a month.
Clinging, sometimes tied, for fear that if you fall asleep falls downstairs.
So tied to this silo that carries exactly that biodiesel that was produced in its field.
Juan paid $23,000 to be transported illegally from Guatemala to the United States.
Those 500,000 liters of biodiesel are transported for the price of $350.
Why will I tell you all this?
And why me?
Well, because I in Latin America, in Guatemala, have lived there for a long time.
And stories like Juan's, I've heard hundreds of them.
Then one day I told myself that someone had to tell it, that someone had to come here and tell those stories.
But, to do so, before I had to deprive myself of something, I had to take something off, I had to take away this shield that we all have, this protection that we have at birth, which is the most precious thing we have.
You will think, when one is born, a newborn child says: “The important thing is health, the important thing is that he is well, the important thing is that he has the money, that there is the sun, that he is in a beautiful place, that he has the love of the family”.
There is a much more important thing, something that is assigned to you randomly, the moment you are born.
One thing that is not possible to touch, which is intangible, that we do not see, but that we all have.
And that’s one of the most violent things ever invented: citizenship.
Citizenship represented by this stupid brown booklet, which we all have.
When you are born, they give you one, it’s a bit like winning the lottery.
I won it, because on my own it says "Italian Republic".
With this I have access to the best education systems and health systems.
With this, I can go to 173 countries without the need to apply for a visa.
There are people like me who wrote “Republic of Syria” on this passport and doesn’t go anywhere.
In 1853, the United States was to build the trans-Pacific railway, the one that travels, say, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
They had a problem, though: in the center of the United States, the Arizona area, they were all mountains.
And so they couldn't build the railroad, in short, it was complicated, it was a mess.
So what did they do?
They went to Mexico, which was in the bill, as it is today, and bought him a piece of land.
The sale of the Mesilla.
Of the gentlemen, in Washington, they drew a straight line, so, in the middle of the desert, because they needed the plain to make the railroad.
Today, through that straight line, the border passes.
There is a city, in that straight line, there halfway that straight line, which is called Nogales.
Nogales is split in two: if you are born there, you have a US passport.
You have access to the best schools.
at the best hospitals.
You have a passport that allows you to go to 167 countries around the world.
If you're born this way, you're Mexican, and you don't do anything with your passport.
Did you think health was important?
The passport is important.
And the passport assigns it, perhaps, for a straight line drawn in Washington 160 years ago.
But I wanted to tell it, I wanted to live it like them.
And to do that, I had to undo this passport.
So I put it in an envelope, and I sent it to a friend's house.
I disguised myself, turned into a Peruvian Amazon migrant named Aymar Blanco.
I crossed the Suchiate River, which divides Mexico from Guatemala, and then I crossed all of Mexico.
Since 1994, Mexico has been working with the United States in the blockade of illegal immigration.
Every year, the United States pours between $4 billion and $6 billion into Mexico to do dirty work, which is to block Central and South American migrants.
So the border is no longer just the transition between Mexico and the United States.
The border is the whole of Mexico!
And Mexico doesn’t end anymore, it’s very long, it’s huge.
Depending on where you pass, it can be more than 4,000 km.
Much of the trip is taken on, stuck, sometimes tied as Juan to these freight trains.
A train that throughout America is known as “The Beast,” or the Death Train.
Father Solalinde defined the train lines as “the largest open-air cemetery in the world.”
Every year thousands of people, maybe fall asleep, or get distracted, fall off the train and end up sucked under the rails.
This train is the emblem of the modern world: a train that travels, a huge train, freight, which does not perform passenger service, which travels non-stop from south to north carrying cheap materials, but without carrying people.
Coal, iron, zinc, copper, pieces of machines, pieces of clothing, finished clothes, mangoes, papayas, bananas.
Everything travels freely without tariffs, without borders, without anything.
The only things that travel illegally on that train are humans.
They kidnapped me three times during this trip.
A gang of hooded men, in the middle of the desert, after stealing everything from us, emptied the water.
They no longer knew what to do with us, now, and they emptied it in front of our eyes, just to make us suffer thirst.
I had to run, run, jump off the train in a hurry over and over again, run faster than pregnant women and elderly gentlemen, to be able to escape.
I had to shut my ears and eyes, so as not to hear the screams of those who had not made it.
According to Amnesty International, 60% of women are raped during this journey before reaching the United States.
60%.
The federal police took us, arrested us, locked us in a cell of 4 meters by 4, in 40 people.
Two days, with 40 degrees of day, no water, no food, no bathroom.
40 people: we had to do the shifts, to sit.
Don't lie down, sitting down.
There was no way to sit all, we did the shifts: a little seated, a little standing.
For two days in a row.
Forced to eat, drink, shit, piss, vomit, faint, all in this space.
Sud on the train was not there, it had been carried away by rain, and then there was a replacement service made with trucks.
And we drove 26 hours hidden in the double bottom of a truck.
When we finished, our joints were so hooked that when we got out of the truck we fell with our faces in the mud.
Our transporters were laughing and drinking tequila.
Nevertheless, driven by despair thousands of people make this journey every year and arrive at the border with the United States, and I with them.
The border with the United States could basically divide it into three.
You arrive, you have crossed all of Mexico but you still have to cross the border, you still have to get to the long-awaited United States.
The easternmost part is the only part where there is really a natural border, which is the Rio Bravo, which by the way is a river with a funny name because in the United States it is called the Rio Grande del Sur, the great river of the south.
In Mexico it is called the Rio Bravo, the bad river.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people drown every year in an attempt to cross it.
The current takes them to the sea and then there the currents of the Gulf of Mexico make fun of them, and they take them to Texas, but dead.
The seven counties of the south coast of Texas have been in a health emergency since 2008 due to the amount of deaths that beach on their shores every day.
To the west, then, there is the wall: 1,223 km, the second largest separation barrier ever built by the human being.
In the 20 years of that wall there have already died, according to official estimates of the United States, 3,040 people.
To give you a term of comparison, in the 28 years of existence of the Berlin Wall the dead were 98.
Here we are talking about 3,040, officers.
In Mexico, estimates speak of 15,000.
Then, in the middle, there's nothing, there's a gap.
What else you have to add, in addition to the Sonoran desert, a desert a third large in Italy with temperatures that exceed 40 degrees during the day and at night they go to -10.
Pima County, just across the border, filed bankruptcy in 2013.
He could no longer pay the electricity bill, to keep the refrigerators that retained 871 unidentified bodies of the dead migrants in an attempt to cross the desert.
That's where I passed.
You walk at night, in the cold, you hide during the day, under an atrocious heat.
Groups of “American patriots”, Americans, poison the wells: one night we found a poisoned well, I was sick.
I owe the life of a Nicaraguan migrant whose name I don't even know.
While I was behind a cactus that I was vomiting, he took me by the shoulder and said, “Oh, look, they leave you here.
You have to move.”
Not everyone has a Nicaraguan guardian angel.
We left in 24 and in Tucson we got there in 19.
Today, through that desert we want to expand, build the umpteenth wall: a further barrier of separation between two countries, a further barrier that wants to prevent the human being from doing the most natural thing he can do: move, move.
We were monkeys 3.5 million years ago.
We got out of the trees to move.
We took the upright position, bipeds to be able to walk over long distances, to be able to move.
The history of the human being is made up of countless movements, of countless migrations and movements from one place to another, in search of food, in search of partners.
Then you come back, you run away from the catastrophes.
The human being is moving.
Children learn to walk before learning to actually use their hands.
Kids walk before they speak.
They learn to walk before eating solid foods.
Human beings are made to walk.
And no wall, no barrier in the world, however great they can build it, no barrier in the world will ever prevent the human being from moving and moving.
Oh, thank you.
(Applause) [The roots are important, in a man's life, but we men have legs, not roots, and legs are made to go elsewhere. - Pino Cacucci]
Today we talk about the future, of young people, of technology, but also of tradition, of know-how, of art, of beauty.
Today I bring you to the factory, and I tell you about that extraordinary opportunity that is at the border between mechanics and digital.
It was the early '80s, and I remember when I was going to the workshop with Dad on Saturday morning.
It was a mechanical workshop, indeed metalworking.
And they built very complicated details for the textile and aeronautical industries.
As we passed through the workshop, I remember a dark environment, a strong smell of oil, my father running right and left to give instructions to anyone he met.
I remember men with big, strong hands, busy, with their heads inside the machines, inside their dark suits.
I also remember a great order and cleanliness – my father has always held a lot to order.
I remember very precise mechanical details: they looked like jewels, works of art: the know-how.
Let’s take a leap forward, we are in 2017, we are in what is called today the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0.
It is a phase of history that is characterized by less defined and wider boundaries than the previous ones.
Let's retrace them together.
The first: 18th century, the introduction of steam power for the operation of production machines.
The second, beginning of the 20th century, electricity, chemical, oil, mass production and assembly lines - Ford.
The third, early '70s: electronics, computers, the first robots, factory automations.
This fourth is basically characterized by a connection between the physical system and the digital system.
And it's very different from the previous ones for at least five reasons.
The first, the speed: while the first took about 80 years to reach full impact, the second 50, the third 30, the fourth is hitting us like a tsunami.
Multidimensionality, amplitude: it does not only cover individual technological dimensions, but very many in acceleration and in combination with each other.
It’s not just about the processes inside the factories, but it’s about more and more products, supply chains, business models – everything is interconnected.
Democratization: the cost of access to these technologies drops dramatically, so it is no longer reserved only for large companies but for an increasingly large audience.
Human capital is at the center of this fourth revolution, much more than it was in the first three.
It is a cultural revolution, even before technological.
The mechanical sector, like everyone else, is not free from this great challenge and this great transformation.
Despite the great crisis that has hit the whole world, mechanics remains the pillar of Italian industry, an Italy that remains the second manufacturing country in Europe, and the fifth for added value in the world.
The mechanics alone realizes 48% of Italian exports and realizes 82% of high- and medium-high-tech production.
We mechanics feel at the heart of this fourth transformation by observing a growing convergence between mechanics, digital and electronic.
Not only in processes, but more and more in products.
The product of this convergence is what we call mechatronics.
This convergence will lead to 26 billion connected objects in 2020.
More and more intelligent products, designed to simplify our lives, to make it safer, which once on the market learn, collect a huge amount of data, feel, react.
How do you do it change the way of doing business in this context?
We in the company make products to move and dose fluids with great precision and accuracy, and given this growing complexity we started asking ourselves this question several years ago.
In 2013 we created a completely separate place, a separate company, a knowledge company where designers and engineers work together on the future.
It is a group of people who are at the center of a network of excellence made up of universities, research centers, experts, technological partners.
Working in an open way, acting and working as architects of innovation, combining technologies, people, knowledge.
This product is an example of the result of the work.
And it is a valve, a device to divert a flow, for use in the medical field – the extraordinary nature of this object lies in the fact that it has been, entirely, not only designed but also computer-tested, through hundreds and hundreds of repeated simulations, to which the task of identifying and sifting the highest possible number of configurations, geometries, has been delegated to identify the best possible according to a target function.
The result was then carried out by 3D printing, it was combined with a shape memory actuator, an intelligent material that serves as a sensor and also as an actuator, then an engine.
All this is a connected product, part of those 26 billion objects that can hear, learn, react according to predefined rules.
These objects are then made in increasingly modern factories, connected, where the staff are hyperqualified, without gender barriers – no longer, it designs and governs complex machines that make the same precise mechanical details of which I have a fan memory – today, mechatronics.
But while all this is happening, while with great dedication and passion we ride this wave, let me go back a moment: it was 2015, it was a Sunday morning, at home, with my three children, then 11, 9 and 6 years old and I spoke, as had happened at other times, of the work of Dad, of the factory, of the mechanics, of all this great transformation.
It was not the first time, but that time it particularly weighed on me not seeing my same enthusiasm in their eyes, and I began to wonder about why.
This transformation so fascinating that we live every day, this digital convergence, for our children, but [also] for families, for public opinion, are distant, unknown.
There is a dramatic gap between reality and perception.
Well, we in industry have never been famous for our ability to tell: we historically prefer to do, than to tell.
I realized, in front of the eyes of my boys, that we were missing an important opportunity while watching this gap grows.
Industry is the place where the most extraordinary transformations of our time are taking place.
And we have to be able to tell it, this, to our kids.
In a new way, with new words.
It took in me a sense of social responsibility, towards my boys in the first place but towards the young people, towards industry, towards the country, because I realized that we were playing so much.
So, as a good engineer, I decided to check my feeling with data.
Involved the association of industrialists, we realized an analysis of the perceived from which emerged, clearly, that to the word metalworking, which still distinguishes our sector, were still associated words such as: iron; blue overalls; mass production; assembly line; dirt; fatigue; oil.
It looked like an image from Charlie Chaplin’s “Modern Times.”
We're talking about the 1930s.
Companies, the people who aim for the future, the protagonists of this transformation, are absolutely not associated with these words, if anything to: technology; precision; electronics; digital; and mechanics; future.
All words, these, associated with the term “mechatronics”.
And so here we started with a project to reposition the sector, to make it the first choice for our young people.
Promoting a cultural change, completely rethinking our way of telling us.
And so we started by simply changing the name, from metalworkers to mechatronics, metalworkers so we were always known.
And then we made an image, a new identity that should tell us in a simple way, talk to everyone.
Then we went to schools, where we involved young people with the “director of enterprises” to make this new world of factories tell through their eyes, through cinema.
We involved the foundation “Progressive Publicity” to go and tell this new change, including social, work and factory.
And then we went to the theater, to the Teatro Strehler in Milan where we told this change with the show “The importance of being called mechatronics”, we told it about young people, about the future, but also of art and beauty.
Yes, because the products we make are beautiful, because they are generated by a way of designing that has in beauty the indispensable quality of doing.
And then we brought this project, and we are bringing this project, on a national scale, because obviously this is not just a Milanese problem, or a Lombard problem.
But let’s go back to our young people, because it has been said that 65% of our children who enter elementary school today will do jobs that do not exist today.
And if we want the future that I told you today to be sustainable to be sustainable, we must be able to involve them, inspire them, bring these guys into.
Today, however, we start from a situation in which in Italy, [there is] 65% of difficulties in finding young people with training in technical-scientific disciplines.
On the other hand, however, they tell us that we have 35% of youth unemployment.
It is paradoxical, we are talking about two worlds that do not speak.
But why do our children, and our families, make choices, choose paths without perspective?
Are they aware of that?
Or they choose, they deliberately err because they see this world so far away, difficult, complex and for which they choose, they make choices that are only apparently simpler.
Work is not stolen by robots, but an inadequate education.
On the one hand, the school model has not been adequate for our times.
In this context, multidisciplinary and the ability to move in complex scenarios are fundamental; creativity and the ability to solve problems are decisive.
And at school you see very little of this.
The school should make known and experiment with the most relevant technologies of our time: I’m talking about blockchain, programming, Internet of Things, Big Data, robotics, intelligent materials, Artificial Intelligence.
And I could go on.
And all this together, of course, art, literature, mathematics.
School should be the laboratory of the future.
It should be a springboard into the future.
And then, the formation must be felt and lived more and more also as an individual responsibility, of young people and of the less young, because today there are the tools and we cannot always wait for someone else to solve the problem for us.
And we, entrepreneurs, must take responsibility for our role, we must have the ability to convey the vision, opportunity and soul of this work.
We have to get out of business and we have to go to schools.
I do it as soon as I have the opportunity, and I assure you: I go out with the aim of inspiring young people and I return inspired, because they are open, they are ready; it is up to us.
And we must do this also as informed parents, curious, aware.
And if I hadn't convinced you yet, come and visit our factories.
Come with your boys.
And come not only in the factories, but in all those places where the future is being planned: I speak of the incubators, of the business accelerators.
I'm talking about university labs, I'm talking about research centers.
Today Italy seems to have lost vision: our young people do not risk, they seem to have surrendered.
But I don't want to believe it.
Italy is a country with deep industrial roots.
A very fertile soil made of extraordinary brains, passion, tradition, creativity.
Of a combinatorial innovation capacity that the whole world envilines us.
We do not throw away all this, letting our children get lost chasing paths without a future.
Nelson Mandela once said, “A winner is simply a dreamer who has never given up.”
And if we want to make our boys win again, we must first of all return to inspire them and make them dream.
(Applause)
Some of the most attentive viewers might inconvenience that they are in this area.
Let's keep a low profile!
So, I am a healthy bearer of optimism and I like the challenges, in fact when they told me to choose where I wanted to talk about optimism, whether in Silicon Valley or in Rovigo, Polesine, Italy, I had no doubts, because it can also be provocative to talk about optimism in this period.
In fact, what we believe to be this time is very important and the vision we have of the future is very important.
Why does the future have to do much with it?
The future has to do with it because it depends on how you see your future, because from that vision arise the actions you do in the present, think for example when we choose a course of study: the first thing we think is: “It will serve when I finish it?
Will it help me find a job?
Will it help me to have a better life?” Then it is very important that we have the awareness of what we are experiencing, if it is true the phrase that “we live the best era in the history of humanity”, not of the last 50-100 years, of humanity.
I am passionate about coaching, I know many coaches, but it was all invented by this here: Socrates was the only real coach, after what do we do?
Let’s do slides by changing the things he said, but the reasoning is his and the claim is simply to make you think.
Make you think to have a different vision.
First of all, we clear the field of a possible misunderstanding: I do not have it with the pessimists.
Pessimists and optimists make their contribution to the world.
If for the optimists we had the plane for someone who dreamed of flying, the pessimists invented the parachute, it is essential that they entered it.
Then it is true that if you parachute you have to be optimistic, because after... well, let's not go into a lap that never ends.
What is our vision of the world?
If we look at the world as we have always seen it, perhaps in a map, what is the idea we have of this world?
With what eyes are we looking at him?
Perhaps someone here in the room, an expert in cartography, geography, will know that this map is not really correct, it reflects a bit the area where the first maps were built, in fact some continents do not have a dimension consistent with what they actually have in reality.
There is a map, it is called the map of Peters, which represents in a more faithful way what is the greatness of the individual continents.
In this map that you see behind me you can see Italy?
Even those in the lodge that paid little?
Can you see it, even above?
Well, those who don't see do a zoom... And now?
Well, we need a few more seconds.
Did you find her?
Well there is Italy, it is just turned.
This map is overturning, but in reality this map is the map that Australia's primary school pupils have in school books.
So, who's running out?
The kangaroos or us?
Neither they nor us, but it is the different vision.
If we detach ourselves from our usual way of seeing things, perhaps we are able to grasp some aspects that could escape us.
We are living a revolution.
If it is true that there have been so many revolutions in the world, the industrial revolution, think of the first industrial revolution: at the end of the seventeenth century, the steam engine, the frame, which completely changed not only the production processes but also interpersonal relationships, the very structure of society.
Two centuries after another revolution, called the second industrial revolution with the advent of the assembly line, with an extensive use of electricity, which changed further, creating trauma, creating fractures and then subsequent well-being.
Think of the third industrial revolution that we have experienced, I believe practically everyone, with the advent of the Internet, and then the last one we are living now, that many define as the fourth industrial revolution, where we talk about genEtica and that and a capital is not a typographical mistake, it is the sense of new problems that we will have to face.
Think that Google is not just hiring computer engineers right now, it is hiring philosophers, to understand where the world ahead will go.
We talk about 3D printing, different connection speeds.
When we have a revolution, always the first reaction is fear: I remember my grandmother with the first cordless phone, it was a phone that no longer had the wire, she was worried: “If the words are not in there, where do they go?” Changes are worrying, even the smallest ones.
One economist wrote, I would like to read it with you, “We suffer from an attack of pessimism.
We have made faster progress over the past decade than in the entire previous story.
The rapidity of technical change produces problems that are difficult to solve, the countries that suffer the most are those that are not at the forefront of technical progress.
We are struck by a new malaise: technological unemployment.
A form of unemployment caused by the fact that we discover new ways to save jobs at a faster rate than we discover new ways to employ the job.”
This could be an article today, but it was written in the 1930s.
And you don’t need to tell you what happened in the decades that separate us from the 1930s.
It is only to make you understand how much a change can, if not correctly interpreted, if not framed in a right vision, create fears, create fears, often unfounded.
One, the classic, is that sooner or later progress will end.
This is the thesis that obviously supports the pessimists, those of the parachute, sooner or later the progress will end.
In reality, however, we have to think of progress as something that accumulates, does not exhaust, it adds to things discovered, inventions, skills that we had before, it is something that is added, not that ends.
Obviously, we can then divide progress into the various areas of life and therefore we see that there are different rhythms.
If technological progress is before everyone’s eyes, as if it had a very steep curve, social progress, not to mention the progress of the last line at the political level, is slower, because this is the characteristic of this era.
The characteristic of this era is speed.
The changes are so rapid that our brain struggles to interpret them, it struggles to realize, and for this reason we think that things can sometimes not change for the better.
In reality, technological progress is offering us incredible solutions for the well-being of all.
There are thousands of examples, look at the graph of the cost of mapping the human genome: $100 million to make a mapping of the human genome in the 2000s.
$100 million, only the world’s 2-3 richest people could afford it.
A few years later he goes down, and comes down with a very optimistic prediction that followed Moore’s law, which is the one that tells us that every year double the capabilities of microprocessors.
So it was a very positive projection, “We’ll soon get from 100 million to 10 million”, it means that instead of the two richest in the world, so many millionaires can afford it.
And then an incredible thing happens, not expected even by the most optimistic scientists: that this price drops very quickly and today the mapping, which cost a few years ago 100 million dollars, today costs less than a tablet, is within reach of many people.
What happened?
It happened that the studies of Frederick Sanger, one of the pioneers in this field, the fourth person in the world to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry, were put online.
Then we went from a series of concentrated intelligences, 5, 10, 15 researchers locked in a lab at 5, 10, 15, 50,000 researchers around the world, and this accelerated the reasoning ability on this issue, bringing much cheaper solutions and within everyone’s reach.
For example, one of the extraordinary characteristics that this future that we will live in the near future will be an absolutely transparent world.
I know it's provocative to talk here about transparency, but it will be.
This is a bus stop in Singapore.
With cigarette butts taken from the ground, the profiles of the people who had thrown them were reconstructed, with traces of DNA.
From this profile, people take the picture, put it on the bus stop, “If you see I’m zozzone, tell them that you don’t throw the butts on the ground”.
This is the transparency that we are seeing in many things, even in politics, in communication, we said it before, we can not delete the thing from the internet and it becomes transparent, a world where we have control and we are increasingly protagonists.
Of course it is difficult to perceive this, because if we see that there are taxi strikes in Rome or Milan, maybe we did not see that in July the first drone taxi in Dubai was inaugurated, which travels alone and maneuvers with a joystick.
And dic: I’m “But I would never go up there”, it’s the same thing we said the first time we went by plane.
We'll go, because it's gonna work.
There are paradoxical aspects, maybe we can think that the characteristic of today, the great progress is that we have generations of people glued to a smartphone screen, and it is true that in China and now even in Belgium they have made lanes on the sidewalks for the people who are chatting.
One might say, “But this such intelligent progress doesn’t seem like me.”
In fact, there are things behind these advances that should make us think, for example when we talk about 5G.
We are thinking, those who have 4G, “Well, what will be?
It'll be a little faster connection, I can download a movie for example --legally I'm referring-- so when I've paid, 1 gigabyte I can download it in 7-8 seconds.
A real wonder!”
It’s not just that, because this changes an evening where you don’t know what to do in your home.
In reality, 5G networks will have a wider capacity and more powerful than optical fiber, they will finally allow automatic driving in cars, allow you to operate remotely with even greater ease and with even greater precision, they will enter our lives, the internet of things will be a reality because these objects will be able to interact with each other at unthinkable speeds today.
And then I say that if you’re not optimistic, with all we have, it’s because you’re probably missing the data.
Today the irrational person, who looks to the future, is the pessimist.
What do we teach our children?
What can we teach our children if statistics and research tell us that 65% of primary school pupils will do a job that does not exist today?
What can we teach him?
I believe that we can teach them, and we too learn, to be better people, people who call themselves optimistic, or those people who transmit positive energy, have common characteristics and I would like to analyze them with you briefly.
They are first of all honest people, and it is a revolutionary word in this age, they are normal people, it is not that an optimist has a paresis.
No, No!
It has its positive moments and negative moments, it’s the different vision.
It’s true that they smile often, optimistic people often smile, then have the ability to share their good mood with other people, never stop making plans.
That they are 20 years old, 30 years old, 70 years old, do not stop making plans.
They have a unique and extraordinary feature: they emphasize positive things.
We all have negative things in our lives and probably if we make a list they come out to us right away.
And the positive things, how long would we do a list of positive things in our lives?
But if you have a parent, a child, a friend who loves you, a hospital within a 50 km radius, electric light, drinking water, are things that don’t go for granted.
I understand that one must not get home, open the faucet and say: “Long live the aqueduct society!”.
It would be excessive, but you have to realize that this makes you a lucky person.
People who transmit positive energy are generous people, who help others, we can teach and this we can practice.
They have no prejudices or are afraid to transmit, to show their affection.
So, being optimistic perhaps today is simply one thing: it is to return to believe in people, but not because man is able to create a 5G network or because he is able to carry passengers with a drone, because man is able to do the most wonderful thing that has ever appeared on this Earth: another human being.
And a person who has this ability can’t help make you think positively in the future.
So how do I do to change the world?
There are many who want to change the world, few think about how to change themselves.
I believe that if you really want to change the world, it’s just about being the best version of ourselves.
Thank you
