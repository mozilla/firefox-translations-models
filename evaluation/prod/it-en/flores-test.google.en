This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that was already widely held, but it provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
. According to the scientists, the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on top, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur plumage does not have the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and barbules, the researchers concluded that the rachis is probably the result of an evolutionary development following these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the find shows adult plumage and not chick down.
According to the researchers&#39; hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals the plumage of an adult specimen and not that of a chick.

The activity carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys carried out on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team had to be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth which generates the tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to infer that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that &#39;normal&#39; matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, made up of a multitude of small particles.

The bill requires that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled &quot;18&quot; and makes selling to minors punishable by a $1,000 fine per violation.
Prosecutors Kier Starmer QC issued a statement this morning that both Huhne and Pryce will be charged.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to fill the role of Enterprise Minister left vacant by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce&#39;s appearance at Westminster Magistrates&#39; Court is scheduled for February 16.
The victims were 25-year-old Nicholas Alden, and the driver, 21-year-old Zachary Cuddeback.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka&#39;s weapon did not go off when aimed at a fifth man&#39;s head. Schneider is in constant pain, blind in one eye, missing a section of his skull and having his face reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconference from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday&#39;s event, Carpanedo competed in two individual races of the Championships.
The first in the slalom, where in the first descent he recorded a DNT. Other 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race in which she participated, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women&#39;s group of the &quot;seated&quot; category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first classified , Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women&#39;s group failed to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 giant slalom participants failed to place in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police managed to recover the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General, DK Arya, announced: &quot;Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also found her cell phone and her laptop.&quot;
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house when the car crashed were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was closed temporarily while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff&#39;s Court on charges of murdering her own son.
She is being held pending arraignment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice has other parameters. The Scottish courts have in fact considered the publication of the photos potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee &quot;journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects are walking on a minefield&quot;.
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, told reporters that no new comments would be made at least until the formal indictment was filed.
According to what has been leaked, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders existing before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
Shooters in the experimental pest control program had to be closely watched by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the Sporting Shooters Association&#39;s hunting programme, the NPWS in partnership with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O&#39;Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four sharpshooters for the first shooting operation received extensive safety training and instruction.
Yesterday Martelly was sworn in to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly&#39;s fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission was Martelly&#39;s response to widespread protests, which began in October, challenging the regime.
The occasionally violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing four people to suffer minor burns.
Japan&#39;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 other overheating-related incidents, which the company described as &quot;non-serious&quot;.
In its response, the ministry called Apple&#39;s postponement of the report &quot;absolutely regrettable&quot;.
The earthquake in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office, no injuries were reported in the nation.
And the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired on the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Many of the hostages were rescued, at least six died.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took over for an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was fatally shot.
Liggins followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
After training in midwifery, in 1959 she went to work at the National Women&#39;s Hospital in Auckland.
While serving at the hospital, Liggins began studying cases of premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two &#39;black boxes&#39; of flight records on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: &quot;Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of two moons. Unique, exactly like her. A strong woman.&quot;
&quot;Luna was as weird as me… Maybe even more… I love and miss her… Let&#39;s hope she&#39;s in a better place,&quot; commented Dustin &quot;Goldust&quot; Runnels.
According to the poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
While campaigning for the 2010 federal election, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II&#39;s reign.
This view is shared by 34% of survey participants, who believe Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia&#39;s last monarch.
At the opposite end of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but has been suffering from several ailments which have led to questions about her fitness.
He has not been able to take the drugs needed to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was tested by several people using various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to the earth, that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and especially how the Earth formed, having collided with comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53, has served as governor earlier this year; last month he signed a law making same-sex marriage legal.
According to him the speculations are nothing more than &quot;political gossip and nonsense&quot;.
A candidate for the presidency is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of obsolete ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is being set up and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and there is no car park or park and ride available on site.
The fears related to the absence of means of transport have revealed the possibility of having the match played behind closed doors, without the support of the team&#39;s fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has been born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at Princeton University, USA, and Uppsala University, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the time required for this process was much longer; this is due to the mating between an endemic Darwin&#39;s finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all sorts of shapes. Can be rolled to create tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin thread, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into foils.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called &quot;illuminated manuscripts&quot; due to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice it is possible to build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color based on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level of the chemical being analyzed is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H for pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped away (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, roll them into a ball.
A reaction will be triggered between the humidity on your hands and the outer layers which will cause a strange sensation and will form a sort of shell.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushed toilet with a connection to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, the remains of sewage systems have been discovered in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in antiquity in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth&#39;s atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space requires a rocket more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car and various other means of transport made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic cats in the wild) that feed on much more numerous small prey items, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The niche concept is the secret of their success, a particular goal that every feline has and which allows it not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are made up of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts very similarly to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other big cats), even with regard to fatal attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (albeit not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four big cats are the only ones to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a line of shouted and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. Whenever possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and nearly all the prey they catch is much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing on the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots blend in with their surroundings and then swoop down on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (e.g. if it moves over a mountain range or river, or moves to a new island, thus making it difficult to return), it will probably find itself in a different environment than it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, therefore, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; continues to need the same adjustments as before.
Over time and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it resembles the other population less and less.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process of forming new species is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide they expel (through exhalation).
Plants process their nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Much of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its era and therefore feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
From its long jaws sprouted more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an additional row located on the palate, so for anyone who crossed its path there was no escape.
We don&#39;t know for sure, but it&#39;s possible that it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs and it is also possible that it was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex was no match for him.
While much of their food would look familiar, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a species of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, rich men liked to feast together lying on their sides while they ate their meal.
Naturally, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include several foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they didn&#39;t have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the god&#39;s abode.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, particular pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurats, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a shrine dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of paramount importance.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple open-air stalls overlooking the street. The stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse sagas it is said that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
Although all &quot;Scandinavian&quot; countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie &quot;The Mystery of the Templars&quot;, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even if there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription &quot;Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776&quot;. The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
While it is not known for certain who wrote it, the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) is known to have been rolled up for storage early in its existence.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was affixed as a label only.
The D-Day landings and ensuing fighting had liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, i.e. by those French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and allied with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940 the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of &quot;Operation Dragoon&quot;.
American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were on their way to Germany.
By civilization we mean a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, constituting a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin &quot;civilis&quot;, which means civil; the term is in turn connected with &quot;civis&quot;, i.e. citizen, and &quot;civitas&quot;, i.e. city or city-state, and therefore in a certain way also defines the dimensions of society.
The city-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural mark through equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as real civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, with Congress being its only component, according to the Charter of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to levy taxes and, given the absence of a national executive or judiciary, relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce its acts.
It didn&#39;t even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between the states.
To change the articles required the unanimous consent of all states. These, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, together with the Germany, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu) are part of Japan, making Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an &quot;archipelago&quot;, considering the presence of groups of islands that compose it.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when soon-to-be-transiting European sailors recorded the island&#39;s name as Ilha Formosa, or Marvelous Island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 establishes a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, starting a transformation that concerned the cereal production systems of the aborigines and hiring Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces; in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thus ceding the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan; the island would remain under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the outlying buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The world&#39;s most common format for still-image photography, for example, is 35mm, the same as the film most widely used at the end of the analogue photography era.
It is still produced today and, more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from digital camera image sensor formats.
Oddly, the height of the 35mm format is 24mm and its width is 36mm.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
The aspect ratio of many of the common formats (for example the APS family of formats) is equal to or very close to this value.
The much exploited and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a glue between European states for over a thousand years, despite the differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved cutting off any essential military and civilian supplies, despite this blockade violating international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties of the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any vessel from entering entire sections of the ocean, also putting neutral vessels at risk.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a similar reaction to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, fierce wars broke out between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands died fighting for a place of honor in Xi&#39;an&#39;s grand palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, among these we can mention the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to the republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since army rankings, instead of being based on class, are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as &quot;Hira&quot; on the mountain of &quot;noor&quot; (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, in itself offers a very clear picture of Muhammad&#39;s spirituality.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
It&#39;s actually not easy to find at all, even if you knew it existed. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You see nothing but beautiful clear sky and oodles of mountains around. From inside the cave, very little of the surrounding world can be seen or heard.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has survived to this day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or &quot;Giza Necropolis,&quot; in Egypt&#39;s Valley of the Kings, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The major pyramid was created in honor of the pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the pharaoh&#39;s wives and family members.
The &quot;arch up&quot; designation looks like a V, and the &quot;arch down&quot; designation looks like a paperclip or square with no underside.
Up means you should start at the tip and pull the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow towards you.
A rising bow usually produces a softer sound, while a falling bow results in a louder, more assertive sound.
You can decide to add your own personalized indications in pencil, but keep in mind that the bowing signs you find printed have a musical value, so in principle they should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, together with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Maria Theresa and Louis Charles of 4 years) and Elizabeth, the king&#39;s sister.
In a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard that had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism incurred in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of their expenses, and the interest on the bonds swung in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly the huge gains from the protracted exploitation of the Filipino people formed the profits underpinning US imperialism.
To understand the Templars you need to know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that practically includes a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or the technological imperative to the strict sense that man&#39;s destiny is moved by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their implementation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology itself has some &quot; effects&quot; on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can state that the automobile necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher rate of accidents on the roads, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for treating injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a consistent component of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time customs, habits and culture associated with this geography have arisen which, being in harmony with the context of society, have been found to be more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similarly to Paris, known nowadays as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its notoriety as a luxury nerve center began around 400 AD and continued until around 1100 AD
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, largely as the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the tenth and eleventh centuries and in the fourteenth century.
Initially the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the east.
But the slowness of communication means that the diffusion of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the time, a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence farming when it is practiced for the sole purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds native to the ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who do not feel represented by society&#39;s standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners, and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, through negligence, as a result of misfortune, or as a result of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called &quot;feral&quot; or savage. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases the abandonment is motivated by the refusal of a serious intellectual or physical impairment on the part of the parents.
Feral children may have experienced severe violence or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others appear to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When the feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, it displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that took care of it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning is supposed to make learning itself easier and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a way of learning, but rather an aid for those undertaking a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of scaffolding, but so is Microsoft Office&#39;s little paperclip assistant.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are intended to interrogate, prompt and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn&#39;t guarantee them nourishment, care and training, but it happens to them.
We believe that foster care represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is supposed to make up for any unmet needs in the home they were taken from.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;socializing&quot; are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord&#39;s (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely &#39;personal engagement&#39; and &#39;continuing relationships&#39;.
The use of video recording has made it possible to make significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting the microexpressions correctly.
In his essay &quot;The President&#39;s Speech,&quot; Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately gauge sincerity.
He even argues that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the variability back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savannah.
Furthermore, failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless cooked.
Animal foods instead (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors solved their &quot;protein problem&quot; in a sense as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally awakening during normal sleep, followed by a return to sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can easily be accomplished by using a relatively silent alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
Should you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can place it across the room, so you&#39;ll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options focused on the biorhythm involve the consumption of plenty of liquids before sleep (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get out of bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace that is proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force exists. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana ritual and various techniques of Indian yoga.
Broadly speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is grounded in Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all encompassing path of love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the awareness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts caused the break between the two countries.
Within two years of the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; Thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and be fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken through; the only option was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans soon proved obsolete as more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to ensure that the country safeguards its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the enemies&#39; ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans attempted to move men and cargo across the Atlantic to support Britain.
At the same time the German navy, using mainly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
Had the Allies failed to do so, Germany probably would have had a chance to conquer Britain, just as it had the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be raised by the cultures and tribes of antiquity in order to have milk, fleece, meat and skin easily available.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds left free to roam on hills or other grazing areas, often looked after by goatherds (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These herding methods are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although formed simply of parallel wooden planks, wagonways, compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses traveling along them to reach greater speeds and to move heavier loads.
Stringers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, even though the iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones. In 1767 the first all-iron rails made their appearance.
The first means of transport known to man were the legs. Humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning &quot;upright man&quot;).
Its predecessor, Australopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Signs of specialization for the bipedal gait are present in Australopithecus fossils dating from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate some future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and even do activism.
In many cases this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, on the other hand, we don&#39;t just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while the problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap&#39;s printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were produced overnight, known today as &#39;The Dunlap Posters&#39;.
The document was publicly read for the first time on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
Dunlap&#39;s 25 known broadsides are the oldest extant copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to think of them as dinosaurs due to their feathers and their ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics in common with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers used today.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, so much so that an immediate diagnosis is impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals in the house.
Check the label for first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term mite is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become human parasites.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, i.e. adapted to living in the nest or in the home of their host.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) has approximately 400,000 known cases in the United States of America, making it the number one neurological disease affecting young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that females are twice as likely to develop MS as males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or that of their child.
These couples have the option to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the birth parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually drives most scientific inquiry.
But it&#39;s not just about experimentation, given that an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; also asking questions and making observations helps to direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle&#39;s views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was genetic material was by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, i.e. viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects based on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germline.
The mutations that can be transmitted to the children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and studying ecosystem information.
For example by visiting, photographing and learning about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns to drive to work, crossing paths with other people whose workplace is the place they just left from.
In this dynamic coming and going, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which they support at the same time.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution for the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, which almost everyone complains about.
In developed countries it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Is it the engineers who design them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
&quot;Traffic Flow&quot; is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is complex because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to be within a reasonably constant range, so traffic flows, in turn, tend to exhibit reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small crevices to hide from predators.
Of all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold their wings are dragonflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don&#39;t feel like the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
Total 20% of the water that flows from the planet&#39;s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. The waters of thousands of minor tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is made up of about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican City language for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the language of daily use spoken by most of the people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious services.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is made up of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These actually look more like the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are thought to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minute amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil has therefore proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and less and less widespread use.
Today, everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the functioning of the fission bomb.
It&#39;s basically like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. Then, by further splitting the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, this means that they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinnest under the seas and thickest under mountainous areas.
The maria may be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding what satisfies or appeals to individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites some people and drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors of the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most popular content theories are Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg&#39;s two-factor theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors can emerge. On the one hand there are those who try to remain &quot;one of the boys&quot; (or girls).
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibilities.
At the other extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person who feels he has to change the whole team and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their next physical team.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as meetings can take place across time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real &quot;invisible team&quot; (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The &quot;invisible team&quot; is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization be willing to go through the lengthy process of building a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When all available resources can be used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to satisfy customer needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological findings demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The search area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior underpins scientists&#39; research.
It has long been known that some types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and change certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our thought processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some application examples are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer queries, as well as handwriting, speech and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is today often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also an excellent excuse to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. In fact, their first experiences with blogs are often characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, the blog author strives to improve the writing to avoid negative reviews.
Blogs also &quot;force students to become more aware of the moment around them.&quot; The need to fuel public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs &quot;can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues&quot; (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the suggestive and bilingual capital of Canada, full of art galleries and museums that tell the story of the country&#39;s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and to the north you can enjoy the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka region and so much more.
All this and more makes Ontario quintessentially Canadian in the opinion of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wilderness.
If you do a comparison of the population, the result may be surprising for many: in the United States there are more African American citizens than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent in its own right.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxury beach resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape Route, which runs from Europe to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: it is recommended that all of them declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for women to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and don&#39;t be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merenides.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it with the name of Casa Branca, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city which was called Daru l-Badya, later called Casablanca by the Spanish traders who chose these places for their commercial bases.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least attractive cities for shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs and lots of knick-knacks, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city&#39;s streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to read up well before making any visits outside of Goma, in order to properly assess the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
It is possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Partly as a result of its relative inaccessibility, &quot;Timbuktu&quot; has come to become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today Timbuktu is a decayed city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, even equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of Unesco heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
In Henry Louis Gates&#39; PBS special &quot;Wonders of the African World&quot; it was a major stop.
With its touch more Arabic than African, the city clearly stands out from the others in the country.
Kruger National Park (Kruger National Park, KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, it borders Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
Covering an area of 19,500 km², the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa&#39;s top attractions and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily fees for conservation and park entry.
Purchasing a Wild Card could also be beneficial, as it grants entry to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the whole territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar graph, all the more striking as it is framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
Most of Hong Kong Island&#39;s urban development has been concentrated on reclaimed land on the densely populated north coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you&#39;re looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world. It extends 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they are also the remnants of the massive jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², about a third of which is marshland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary; there are an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang) depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the service buses between different districts are often full, it will be advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge connecting the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l&#39;Oyapock, French Guiana.
Its two pylons have a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes 3.50 meters wide.
Below the bridge, the free vertical space is 15 metres. The construction finished in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only took place in March 2017.
By September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully functional.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called &quot;The Great Province of the Indies&quot;, was born in the 16th century from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its identity and its indigenous characteristics.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place in the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here you can attend minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, contact the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands has its own official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards may not be accepted on the outlying islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners beforehand to decide on an acceptable payment method.
It is nearly impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so change money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely dip below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than that indicated by the thermometer.
There are no defined &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;rainy&quot; seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to being seen by humans, the fauna is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how tame they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bear, practically any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for failing to maintain adequate distance. Adequate space must be given to these animals as they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This harbor witnessed the infamous naval standoff of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 US and German lives were lost.
In the course of the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is located between two harbours. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The Pacific Ocean beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbor district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mostly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the posh suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a large selection of shops. You can swim safely.
The best known local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called &quot;Number One&quot;. The other local beer is called &quot;Manta&quot;.
Many French wines can be had, but those from Australia and New Zealand might be better suited for the journey.
The local tap water is totally safe to drink, but if you&#39;re scared, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, &#39;flat white&#39; coffee is the brainchild of a foreigner. &#39;Espresso&#39; is short black coffee, cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is on the same level as the Belgian one. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many reef trips are made throughout the year and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Always seek advice from the authorities, follow directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear it and tend to keep their distance.
Saltwater crocodile habitat is mainly river estuaries north of Rockhampton, they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, transfers from/to the airport or even combined flight+hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need some time to think about the offer or to get additional documents needed for your destination (eg visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most attendees decide to camp on site, considering this a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the action you need to get there early and secure a space close to the music.
Keep in mind that once the music has finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes rather annoying noises for those most exposed to it.
St. Petersburg cruises include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are granted visa waiver (check conditions).
Generally, casinos go out of their way to maximize the time and money spent by their guests. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer upscale food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in the mood and stay entertained.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered on the house. However, being intoxicated impairs judgment and any good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone deciding to drive at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is reduced and it is not possible to drive as well as on clean asphalt.
During a blizzard, so much snow can fall in no time at all that you&#39;ll be stranded.
Precipitation and snow flurries, or the formation of ice or condensation on vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are arguably Africa&#39;s biggest tourist attraction and a holiday highlight for many visitors.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to overland journeys, particularly to the savannah, to view beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal gear is enough to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and are therefore best observed with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a &quot;bush walk&quot;, &quot;hiking safari&quot;, or &quot;walking&quot; safari) is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, with parts of the events taking place in other locations around Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games. The first Olympics were in fact held in 1964.
If your bookings for flights and accommodation for 2020 were made before the postponement was announced, you could be in for a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary between them, however most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, as of late March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020 when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets will cost around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can make them easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of irons and ironing boards, even if they are not in the room.
If you don&#39;t have an iron, or if you don&#39;t like wearing ironed socks, you can try a blow dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to subject the fabrics to excessively high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to sanitize water and some of these are more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters varies, so if in doubt it is advisable to evaluate the purchase of water packaged in sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not common in their home regions.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case scenario, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infection.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people do not usually qualify as vermin.
Duty Free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save big, especially on items like alcohol and tobacco.
The section of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions, often passing through isolated patches of vegetation.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes peeled, as steep inclines, narrow lanes and sharp curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are decidedly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent stretches (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Oddly, however, the level of cell phone service coverage in this area is much higher than elsewhere on the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German baked sweets also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
Those who want to taste small but rich in flavor desserts can orient themselves on what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either &quot;dry&quot; or &quot;wet&quot;, depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is normally used for curries in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines encountered in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread across the archipelago, offers a range of simple-to-prepare dishes; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider&#39;s feet and are hung on the two sides of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability to the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility that the rider&#39;s feet get stuck in them.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some security measures you can take.
First, most riders wear heeled riding boots with a smooth, rather thin sole.
Later some saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars inserted, which cause a leather stirrup to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: Chile&#39;s premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, home to a large number of huge granite walls and crags.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are continually tracing new routes on its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve sliding on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also referred to as &quot;ski bums&quot;, who dedicate entire holiday periods to skiing in a particular district.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings with the representation of humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport has its origins at least in the seventeenth century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Ski hiking: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski mountaineering or ski trekking.
It is connected, even if it usually does not include them, to touring skiing or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a path similar to a hiking one.
If conditions are good, you can cover somewhat greater distances than walking, but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel across multiple countries, you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area rather functions as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from border to border without having to go through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider an object that is at least 100 years old as such.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit which can be lower, such as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Handicrafts could be defined as antiques, albeit newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture underpinning this trade also underpins many other professions.
Even down through the ages, not all Sámi people have always been involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer mainly as working animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the land of the Sámi.
Although widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word &#39;gypsy&#39; is often found to be offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveler&#39;s warning were to be issued for the destination you will be visiting, it could impact your travel medical insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than your own, but please note that these opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Notices are simply a brief summary of a country&#39;s political situation.
The opinions reported are often superficial, general and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
&quot;Adverse weather conditions&quot; is the general expression used to indicate any dangerous meteorological phenomenon which can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in any part of the world, and there are many different types, depending on the geography, topography and weather conditions.
Severe winds, hail, above-normal rainfall and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered as a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching the Internet for &#39;Hostile Environments Course&#39; you are likely to find the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all of the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games as well as lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are widespread, while there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents with them for the return journey.
The intention of governments to issue gender-neutral (X)-free passports or updated documents to match a desired name and gender varies.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Inspections at security checkpoints have also become much more thorough in the post 9/11 2001 era.
Pre-operative transgender people should not expect to pass screening without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Rip currents are the backflow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formation.
Due to the submarine topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming back will be no more difficult than normal.
Try to identify an area where you don&#39;t risk being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for help, based on your skills and if you&#39;ve been spotted.
Reentry shock occurs in a shorter time than culture shock (there is a shorter &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes have a hard time readjusting to the culture of their home country.
When you return home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
In your first experience abroad, you are likely to have met people who are patient and understanding, aware that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
Many people did not imagine patience and awareness were also necessary for those returning home.
The pyramid sound and light show is the highlight of the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise from tourists and vendors. The sound and light show is just like a story book.
The Sphinx becomes the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water gives rise to a magnificent natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the region lying south of the peninsula and bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the peninsula&#39;s mountains merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360km range bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4892m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only alternative.
A satellite phone is generally not a substitute for a cell phone, because to call you must be outdoors with an unobstructed line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by leisure craft, including pleasure craft, as well as missions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options for those planning to take a gap year is to travel and learn.
It&#39;s especially popular among recent college graduates, since they can take a year off before starting college without compromising their education.
In many cases enrolling in a gap year course abroad can actually increase your chances of resuming higher education upon returning to your home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the &quot;Land of a Thousand Lakes&quot; there are also thousands of islands, within lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You don&#39;t necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
While coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland&#39;s national pastime, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also occurs in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather unusual fact (eg in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that it is possible to visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required to go ashore (as of 2009) using onboard excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be scary for people of all ages and all conditions, especially if they have never flown before or have had any traumatic experiences.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not unlike the personal fears and aversions that many people have towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little about how planes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or not being in control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Timing is often very important in the case of business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but problems arose on other routes and in the case of smaller companies.
On some routes, shipments by air would take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And that&#39;s where you come in, since airline regulations don&#39;t allow you to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly first class or business class the obvious way is to fork over a tidy sum for the privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is steep: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for Business travel and up to eleven times the fare for First Class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B it is also not worth looking for discounts on seats in first class or business class.
Airlines are well aware that there is a category of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably, and they charge certain rates accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic which has been the scene of an ethnic conflict in the past.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport crossroads.
The ancient city of Smyrna spreads over a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, evolved and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more akin to Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey, the wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping malls are dotted with distinctive red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market century and from ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the churchyard, on some of the tombs, there are some interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the charming village.
To the north is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, which is easily accessible. It became famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to Lord Byron&#39;s brilliant account of its glories.
The Scotturb 403 bus line runs regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Still in the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), place of Marian apparitions famous all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a mass grave, and has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world&#39;s population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many more who saw their loved ones murdered or worked to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid Holocaust or Nazi jokes.
Avoid defacing these places by smearing the structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority being able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used for public transport and other services.
On the Metro, ordinary announcements are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service outages are communicated in a variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and conceited.
Even if it&#39;s often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to feel comfortable in Paris is still to behave at your best, relating as a &quot;bien élevé&quot; (well-mannered) person. This will definitely make your travels easier.
The rough exterior of Parisians will quickly fade if you show off some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly of beech, spruce and fir trees, and is characterized by a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of different microclimates, soils and altitude levels, it has a great variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to a huge variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and capercaillie, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially one in bright colors, you&#39;ll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers below the knees.
These too can be borrowed from the storeroom at the entrance; however the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not feel comfortable. For men, one size fits all!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil throughout.
Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the condiments available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, other than the pronoun &quot;Sie&quot; used for the polite form that stands for &quot;You&quot;, always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand if a verb or an adjective is used in a noun form makes writing quite complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively straightforward since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation changes according to the following vowel.
Also make sure to pronounce &quot;r&quot; and &quot;rr&quot; differently: caro means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language may hastily conclude that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Nowadays pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, early cherry blossom parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants are at their best when in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to get even &quot;just&quot; one.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you the removal from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around; you can buy just about anything once you arrive.
But being in the &quot;high tropics&quot;, only a few degrees north of the equator, you&#39;ll have to contend with the heat (always) and strong sunshine (more rarely, when the skies are clear).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes inside Hebron and doesn&#39;t stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be an excellent theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Most of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians from all over the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an open place to admire the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In more traditional churches, a paschal vigil is frequently held on Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the ceremony at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ&#39;s resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands arrived there by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, the mammals could not make the journey. This has caused the giant tortoise to become the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats have been introduced to the Galapagos since the arrival of man.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during the winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun stays below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility of witnessing the northern lights, because the sky remains dark almost throughout the day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners tend to be used to.
Office attire normally consists of a jacket and tie or business suit and colleagues are addressed by last name or professional title.
Workplace harmony is crucial, as it values team effort rather than praising individual accomplishments.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors on every decision, and are expected to follow instructions without question.
