The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning&#39;s crash, the Prague Stock Exchange restored its losses.
Transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of current daily trading.
Since early Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the previous day&#39;s crash which was nearly 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, even here, we see a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Stocks plunge in Asia
Shares in Asian stocks experienced a dramatic plunge on Tuesday, although the indices, however, later erased some of their losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange&#39;s Hang Seng Index during the day erased almost 4%, but later also erased part of the losses to stabilize at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but the losses eventually settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, dropped by 3.6%.
&quot;The planning of the bailout action is uncertain and it will affect financial markets around the world,&quot; noted Hong Kong Bureau Chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its financial policy by itself, therefore without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates on the same level as the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian premier Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise there is a risk that other countries will also feel the consequences.
Massacre of American stocks
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (nearly twelve billion Czech crowns) were to be allocated.
Lawmakers thus ignored President Bush&#39;s plea to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks experienced a carnage on Monday, with major stock indexes posting the biggest plunge in more than two decades.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly 7%, and a slump of similar size was last seen in 1987.
The index was already dropping before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the US government can give 700 billion dollars to the banks.
The highest representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an understanding of economic support for the US financial system.
The vote on this will be early next week.
US lawmakers have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the bailout plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (nearly twelve billion crowns).
But it hasn&#39;t been said yet.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
House Banking and Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank told Reuters on Sunday.
In the Senate, according to some sources, a vote on the plan could probably not be before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of reawakening the financial markets.
Subsequently, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to reach the aid of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
&quot;We have taken a big step forward.&quot;
&quot;We have clarified our differing views regarding the form of the market stabilization package presentation,&quot; Democrat Nancy Pelosi told the Bloomberg news agency.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Deputies from lawmakers met Saturday night with US Finance Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government&#39;s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We have completed the definitive agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market&quot;.
&quot;It is still necessary to carry out the recovery plan, but I think we are there,&quot; said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis has a heavy impact on stock markets which are crashing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, lawmakers are also trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are, chronologically, the first to influence the market on Monday following the Congressional decision.
But for the moment it is not definitively clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law and even if the negotiations could be stopped at the last moment on some problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount foreseen for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it gets the impression that the program is not performing its function, blocking the next 100 billion dollars and after the final 350.
Bush welcomes the progress in the negotiations.
Even if the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has persisted, namely to obtain the finances to buy the mortgage debt, whose price has plummeted due to hundreds of thousands of Americans being unable to pay their mortgages. .
&quot;We worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,&quot; the Republican senator mentioned.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday&#39;s positive performance and appreciated &quot;the effort by both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.&quot;
Golden parachute restriction
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the principal spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on accountability of the finance program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget on reductions, splitting the finance plan.
The new law must also limit so-called golden parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will monitor the funds.
These should be managed by the finance ministry.
&quot;We have worked very hard and have taken a big step towards the agreement that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans,&quot; said Paulson.
The plan is counting on helping homeowners who are having trouble paying.
The government is expected to negotiate the new mortgage payments it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly payments on mortgage payments for borrowers and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
&quot;And this is because we do not know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide the losses between themselves,&quot; Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so crucial.
&quot;Much more important is that already this week congressional representatives agree to support this plan and christen it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important right now,&quot; Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceptible weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the populist right-wing parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People&#39;s Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously faltering, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten sub-prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the socio-democratic one (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, however it loses 5.5%.
It went even worse for ÖVP, who lost almost 9% of the votes with 25.6%.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular parties, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the populars had a significant advantage in preferences over the SPÖ.
But the voters evidently punished them because they scuttled the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that they could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
Perhaps this evolution should facilitate the path towards the increasingly probable way out of the electoral result, i.e. towards the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the liberals (FPÖ) gained early 18% and the BZÖ 11% of votes - but the socio-democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the popular collective government, (at the time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even a reason for sanctions by the European Union.
Haider obviously plays on this evolution, who has already declared that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party also managed to enter Parliament, but it fell slightly, dropping from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has evidently passed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Duel to the death: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost any cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
From this it becomes clear that it is better to just buy the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for which to get a standalone reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc&#39;s latest album on it.
First of all, these musical products are not released as LPs and from a qualitative point of view there is not even an objective reason for this.
However, if hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are crowded on your shelves, you probably dream of a turntable like this at least.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8,000 crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to digest the twenty-crown headphones on the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It&#39;s the battery life that decides.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just play music, but cell phones can&#39;t even accidentally.
There is no other device today as universal as the cell phone.
Alongside the primary functions, making calls and sending text messages, it can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better, sometimes worse, and maybe it can even navigate.
And if we take smartphones and PDAs into consideration, you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It&#39;s a small miracle since no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the screen will ask for the charger.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap cell phones, don&#39;t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add to it, from time to time, a few calls, get yourself another charger at work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won&#39;t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have the universal USB port, and in addition, not all of them can be connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few memory players can do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in cell phones.
Players, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the unit with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create themselves a media library sorted by artist names, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with OS).
Players are easier to handle, cell phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, look first and foremost at battery strength, memory capacity, the quality and type of audio outputs, and of course ease of use.
If you need music above all as a background and if you listen to it only briefly every day on the tram, any mobile phone that can play MP3s will suffice.
This succeeds now, of course to any mobile phone.
You don&#39;t have to worry too much about which formats your mobile phone or player recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
Apart from this format which belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by the Apple company and its Ipods).
The best cell phones also allow you, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough to visit, through the mobile Internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or other provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile phone reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is meager and is usually limited only to hits of the moment on the radio.
The prices aren&#39;t exactly very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phones with them.
Anyone who wants to listen to a little something rummages in his pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
However, this also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small fraction of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of cell phone readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very decent Walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the lack of an input for common headphones.
The best and technically the most equipped mobile phones and even with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead the advantage of the readers is, among others, the easy handling.
The simpler not necessarily cheaper ones (see our pick) really anyone can handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the record player, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally bumping up the mobile internet network and consequently a gigantic bill for data transmission.
Which appliance to get
Even the cheapest cell phones (for example Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also for the purchase of the respective card, you are within the 2 000 crowns.
But be careful
Base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player as well, get Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you shouldn&#39;t spend more than 1,100 kroner.
If you are part of the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized mobile phones - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service thus approaches the MP3 player itself.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made the most headway, whose Walkman line phones have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above brands offer you the same service and price category up to 4 000 kroner, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (commonly 15 hours, usually maximum up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Perhaps
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer practically all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here – a virtual operator who forces the traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe it won&#39;t be missing for a long time.
We have already written many times on Mobil.cz about the fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe.
After all, ČTÚ also confirmed it, pointing out that the price of SMS is higher in Italy than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really like to start the fight.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage well above 100%.
However, mobile phone operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, also often emphasizes, who in the past sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably doesn&#39;t have many possibilities anymore. (After all, perhaps it would be difficult to find other frequencies by now).
But there is yet another possibility - the virtual operator.
Just the entry on the market of virtual operators has led to a significant lowering of prices, to which traditional operators would then have had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices were resounding in Great Britain as here.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be truly successful.
After all, we don&#39;t have to go very far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the arrival of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking stands the financial group Penta which in the Czech Republic belongs among others to U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to actually function, it needs far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry, that is, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at a low cost, offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the more restricted service offer
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers text messages that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, even betting on a significant target group can be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men, so to speak.
&quot;Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and they can trust&quot; says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept can be affirmed here as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts it: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated.&quot;
In the Czech Republic no chance, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is ever an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;There is talk of expanding this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not full of expectations.
The ignition of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries in our area,&quot; Jana Studničková, the press spokesperson of the financial group Penta, said in a telephone conversation for Mobile.cz.
Thus he indirectly confirmed that the current traders in the Czech Republic are definitely not very supportive of this thought.
Quite the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor is created.
For some time now, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would thus like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
&quot;We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only landline services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner it is done the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already managed to make progress in negotiations with some of them,&quot; says group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
From unofficial information it emerges that we will have to have the first virtual operator perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, an impenetrable wall of silence rises around his creation.
&quot;Right now we don&#39;t believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now, no person with a complex and serious project has approached us,&quot; Vlastimil Sršeň of the press section of Telefònika O2 mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The other operators also make use of the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: &quot;So far, we have not noticed any viable and mutually beneficial commercial project on which it is possible to continue building.&quot;
And he adds: &quot;It is unlikely that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
By now we should have already had a concrete agreement on the table, in order for it to be possible to consider it on the horizon.&quot;
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: &quot;We are open to negotiations on potential virtual operators, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.&quot;
The competent authorities - with the accomplice operators
The attitude of the mobile telephony operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, it would lead to a lowering of prices and with this a decrease in profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances surrounding the U:fon creation testify that when operators care about something they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure was on ČTÚ in the period of creation of U:fon to the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for not accepting the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: &quot;The competitive environment of the mobile telephony market was recently boosted above all with the entry of the fourth mobile operator in the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on it and above all on its services.&quot;
However, the complete lack of interest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies is surprising in the attitude of the mobile telephony operators.
It is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
That belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, this has assumed its typical position in relation to the whole problem.
&quot;The entry of the virtual operator on the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract for the rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for the traditional operators,&quot; said Kristián Chalupa, of the ÚOHS External Relations Section, in response to our question.
Such a worded statement by the operators&#39; representatives is perhaps not surprising.
On the other hand, on the part of the office which has to defend the interests of consumers and above all ensure that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the lowering of prices for mobile telephony services.&quot;
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices are not in the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence arises by itself.
Just as the identical price of petrol for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
&quot;The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, therefore it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator,&quot; Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of market dominance is one of many controversial points.
Of course there is the analysis of the relevant markets elaborated by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - the agreement of the network operator is always required for the creation of a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator has – ultimately logically – a monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we didn&#39;t admit this argument, it should be a little alarming to ÚOHS that three mobile operators proceed in such an eerily similar way.
At the same time the complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Offloading responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick by which ÚOHS stays out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ&#39;s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved update of the Telecommunications Law, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve from this.
This fact the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
It can be done, when no one is watching
While without our realizing it, the functioning of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephony services which, however, are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the pre-specified people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators forbid such pre-sales.
&quot;If the cases you mention arise, which we will look into, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company&quot;, replied Martina Kemrová to the question in question.
But it is highly unlikely that such an activity did not reach the ears of the responsible subjects of mobile telephone operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned, there can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends himself against such an attitude at the same time.
In other words, they derive a considerable profit from the activity of these companies and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way by their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: &quot;The law permits such speculation, yet only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have full use of it like regular customers of mobile phone operators&quot;
But this should be the least bit strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another question opens up for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why are they blocking the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to unmask similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not have to settle for the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions forbid it.
When we won&#39;t be more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile telephony market has brought about a considerable reduction in the prices for services.
At the same time in practically all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically identical - market too small, borderline too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries it was precisely in these cases that the regulatory bodies intervened in defense not of the mobile telephone operators but of their customers.
With both formal measures and non-formal pressure, then the first virtual operator was created and others followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing the whole case from one to the other like a hot potato.
In our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of competences in these cases is more than convenient for them.
But let&#39;s not throw in the towel.
If the information behind the scenes is correct and the virtual operator will appear with us really soon, the Czech mobile phone market will get back on its feet.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it would be difficult for ÚOHS to remain impassive to the refusal (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling at higher prices than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem &quot;Kde domov můj&quot; on the occasion of the Czech State Recognition Day.
The new recording of the anthem was made by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choir passage and the instrumental edition.
The singing is under the direction of Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier he told the radio &quot;Český rozhlas&quot; that he specially chose to sing the solo variants, singers with the most representative young voices, who are expressive and popular.
&quot;From the beginning I have tried to make sure that both, and also the choir, have clear diction, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony,&quot; he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song &quot;Kde domov můj&quot; was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in Josef Kajetán Tyl&#39;s original opera Fidlovačka accompanied by music by František Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the &quot;new&quot; anthem sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will also accompany you with an electronic card for the first time
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers boarding the metro, tramway and bus will have an electronic card in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
Right now, around 100,000 people who own their own Opencard can get one.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual card (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at the Infopoints and offices of the Transport Company and at the Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice metro stations, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons can already be bought on the Internet on the Transport Company page www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who start using the service via the internet can completely forget about the counters at the metro stops where until now they had to stand in long queues for paper tickets.
The coupon can be bought on the internet and on the Opencard they can top it up at one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
&quot;In these places, passengers have access to a counter with trained personnel who will help those interested in making purchases on the internet and will also register the acquired credit on their card.&quot; said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to load electronic coupons onto Opencards at ATMs and self-service machines installed at the metro entrances.
What are these ATMs like?
They are red, look like ticket validators and passengers have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stops.
&quot;Now there are five throughout the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; concluded Opatrný.
The coupon will be checked instead of by the driver at the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after paying the coupon, it will be loaded on top.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban train and bus lines from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
&quot;In the trains added to the integrated transport of Prague there are inspectors equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity,&quot; explained the ticket control method Filip from the Ropid organization, which develops the timetables of the public transport in Prague.
City buses have card readers built into the driver&#39;s box.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the specific point next to the cash desk.
Thus the driver verifies the validity of the coupons loaded.
&quot;If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded coupons, there&#39;s nothing easier than asking the driver for this kind of information,&quot; added Drápal.
Passengers who take city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the coupon expires, can go again to the self-service ATMs, where the coupons are loaded onto the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the USA
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 demanded that Šumava be included in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we can&#39;t be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to reports, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the US president in 1945.
This emerges above all from the letter preserved in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of Southern Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the &quot;Šumava district&quot; – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,&quot; the letter reads, signed with the words &quot;The people who care for the fate of Šumava with all the heart&quot;.
Since, they say, annexation to Czechoslovakia - knowing the Czech national character - gives the Sudeten Germans hope only for brutality, inconsiderateness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray to the American president to assume the protectorate over Šumava now and forever.
&quot;We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allies,&quot; the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot; thirst for revenge.
If the US president doubts the conviction of the Germans of Šumava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the willingness of its inhabitants to become part of the USA or live under US control.
While the text of the letter may seem naïve with our knowledge of postwar history, according to some witnesses it aptly describes the expectations of Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans must have guessed at all that it would be their displacement from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Budějovice in the Baltic Sea Power.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a POW camp at Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans came to see him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They thought the Czech would come in handy when they got home,&quot; Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war counted on the fact that on the basis of Beneš&#39;s decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
Don&#39;t think - you will pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček&#39;s office expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his seat belt before leaving.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least professional drivers.
What is it that will appear in the commercials?
Especially people&#39;s stories that will affect emotions.
And this is also testified by the &quot;bloody&quot; slogan of the whole campaign:
Don&#39;t think - you will pay!
The word &quot;don&#39;t think&quot; is capitalized on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word &quot;you will pay&quot;.
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The commercials will &quot;scare&quot; viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic scenes of accident victims can commonly be seen.
This promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The commercials were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to the drivers
&quot;The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they run a red light and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risk,&quot; says Transport Ministry psychologist Martin Kořán from Na Homolce hospital.
And therefore we need information campaigns in the press and above all negative publicity, believes the psychologist.
According to him the panels that warn drivers of the danger are already less effective.
&quot;If you have installed the fixed panel that warns of danger, it will probably soon blend into the surroundings and drivers will no longer pay attention to it,&quot; warns Kořán.
Olmert would return nearly all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace
The premier of the Israeli interim government Ehud Olmert has spoken out for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that the Jediot Achronot newspaper published on Monday.
&quot;We have to come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all,&quot; Olmert told the newspaper.
&quot;We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas) to the Palestinians, because without this there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He admitted that any restitution would also include East Jerusalem .
&quot;Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and above all doesn&#39;t want bulldozers or bulldozers to run over him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem,&quot; noted Olmert in referring to the two July attacks in the city, in which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find &quot;a particular solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places&quot; located inside the Old City. .
&quot;Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won&#39;t work,&quot; he further stressed.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel&#39;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which according to him is the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
&quot;I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,&quot; he warned.
&quot;The Syrians know what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shia movement); they will have to renounce the permanent support they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the Shiite movement) of Al-Qaida (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,&quot; the premier specified.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool off
Failure to resolve the issue with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegal beetle harvesting in India could lead to some cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today&#39;s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
&quot;If it doesn&#39;t resolve, then yes, some cooling would occur,&quot; he noted after the meeting which took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive power can hardly meddle in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling which falls under its jurisdiction.
&quot;Your problem could be solved,&quot; the Minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison to appeal to a higher instance.
Then he can ask for release on bail and wait for the sentence in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion during the negotiations.
&quot;He recommends the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain pardon,&quot; said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter into the matter is to provide the convicted with &quot;competent legal support&quot;, argued the Indian minister.
At the same time he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
&quot;We have a vested interest in maintaining the best relationship with India that has been handed down for many years.
Even the Indians admit it,&quot; Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
&quot;We truly consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a profound mistake,&quot; he said.
The minister declined to answer the question of whether he had obtained a promise from the Indian side to take care of the matter.
&quot;I got relatively a lot of promises,&quot; he just noted.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law doesn&#39;t recognize them, you can&#39;t walk on the bus that travels long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus of the Student Agency company the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the ride.
&quot;If we want to comply with the law strictly and formally, the steward&#39;s activity is in conflict with the road traffic law,&quot; says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
Last week&#39;s accident in which a 22-year-old stewardess lost her life was caused by a lorry which cut off the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting at that moment next to the driver on the least safe seat on the bus, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing room according to the vehicle registration document.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses have no standing room, the director of the company Radim Jančura confirmed to the Aktuálnĕ.cz website.
&quot;We evaluated this with the Ministry and initially did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
It was later lifted and we concluded that passengers can use the restroom during the ride if they have their assigned seat,” he expressed his view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
&quot;There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward&#39;s role – no law addresses the regularization of this role.&quot;
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the term vehicle attendant, his rights and duties are not defined,&quot; spokesman Hanzelka adds less clearly.
Director of the Road Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný however believes that the law takes care of this problem enough.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing places.
That&#39;s all,&quot; he says.
Categorize buses into city buses with standing room and limited maximum speed, long-distance bus with standing room and higher maximum speed, and long-haul buses without standing room with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like in an airplane, says the expert.
BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
&quot;During a smooth ride there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on an airplane.
It&#39;s not safe there either when there&#39;s turbulence and the flight attendant can hit her head.&quot;
&quot;If the bus makes a sudden stop of course the laws of physics apply.
Equally as in the city bus or on the tram.
The transport company must solve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation,&quot; he says and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the problem has not been solved.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards..
This takes about two hundred.
Not even after the accident did the director consider their job dangerous.
&quot;As soon as I feel that I must regard stewardship as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
Expenses would also decrease,&quot; he says.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, justified the absence of stewards on his vehicles as an interest in safety.
&quot;We have no hostesses, we&#39;ve already opposed it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident,&quot; Týden.cz said less than a year ago.
An immense tragedy has occurred.
In the accident on the line to Naples, a young stewardess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years, died.
A Slovenian lorry probably left the hard shoulder without using the arrow and blocked the way for the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver, but hit him with his front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two places reserved for rest of the stewarts had been occupied.
&quot;It is not possible to reserve these seats on long-haul coaches, they are non-transferable.&quot;
The company plans to sue the truck driver.
The agency won&#39;t wait for the court&#39;s ruling to pay damages to the girl&#39;s family, but expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewards on board buses.
&quot;They haven&#39;t achieved any concrete results though.
They don&#39;t consider them so much the coaches, they are more concerned with the points system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving,&quot; says expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider steward activity as a major threat to passenger safety,&quot; concludes spokesman Havelka, who is responsible for the police and safety offices to control the safety of buses.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
He approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent sea areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The zone is at once as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 workers at OSN&#39;s Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his presentation and occasionally adds something.
Dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find petroleum, metallic ores and other mineral materials, but also hitherto unknown living organisms that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest seabed on the mainland
Coastal states have begun to take an interest in underwater territory.
According to the OSN convention that is, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf which often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
That has according to the convention an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental shelf.
&quot;In a nutshell, a continental shelf means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends across the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles,” Mikulka explains.
The application for which the country presents before the commission for the definition of the dimensions of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
&quot;One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The commission has dealt with 5 requests so far, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees were successful,” adds Mikulka.
Australia&#39;s recent success in significantly expanding its marine holdings has received worldwide echo.
But New Zealand has also gained - the seabed area, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, is about 1.6 square kilometers so roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will yield them in the future from the seabed, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for ten years since &quot;the Montego Bay convention&quot; was ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins which the convention has declared the common heritage of humanity.&quot;
Here now no state has an exclusive position.
The right to mine in this area is granted by this international institution established by the convention.
&quot;But the Seabed is not Klondike,&quot; director Mikulka exaggerates, &quot;with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established.&quot;
The Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the common organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
In 1991, like investors from a few other states, this acquired the so-called &quot;pioneer investor&quot; status according to the convention.
It has the right to mine in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extending between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is jagged, it is an almost submarine replica of Tatry.
&quot;It is possible to mine on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a deposit rich in polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,&quot; explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker from the Macedonia division Robert Sandev brings an artifact with him to show.
It looks like a small potato or with a little imagination, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of the awakening of the Golem.
Düsseldorf&#39;s hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the collaborators of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that &quot;the capital market center of the savings bank finance group&quot; could be formed through the unity meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution with Frankfurt&#39;s Deka-Bank.
West LB would launch &quot;a competent block&quot; with lasting profits in such an enterprise.
Furthermore, such a union could be a decisive push for further ties in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is how it is read when a board of directors wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the troubled WestLB is still under great pressure.
Not only by the EU commission, but also through the National Financial Supervision Service, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in the search for a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the customers of the Savings Banks themselves already know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB have certainly been talked about for quite a while, even from Frankfurt&#39;s side.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas said when presenting the turnover for the first half of the year that a merger of the house near Mainz street with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the director of the Deka, half of which is brought in by the regional banks and consortia of savings banks, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
This could be the market trades or parts of them.
However, the conversations have, as they say in the business square, only just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important in the business center in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003, for a short time it seemed that the Deka-Bank might merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba.
Nothing came of this trio.
As soon as the plans were published, the Hessian regional bank was against Helaba&#39;s participation.
The remaining two institutes also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate instead went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always often thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
However, in the end Günther Merl , chairman of the Helaba board, spoke out against planning games to reunite with his house.
Apart from this, it seems that knowledge is being created, that it is necessary to approach the different houses of the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-Württemberg could first take place.
This is not entirely good news for Helaba.
If pressure builds for more mergers, partners will gradually fail.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has survived the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings bank association, which holds 85 percent of Helaba, has put the bolt on the meeting with the WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain
These geo-strategic reasonings are only one thing.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of the regional banks would be secured, had not yet been answered by the association of German savings banks.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which of course is not desired by it.
Thus the letter from the board of directors expresses the will to aspire to a &quot;general solution&quot; in any case.
It will be seen how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the 5l barrel. of the Kaiser brand stands a massive bearded man and demonstrates to the approximately 200 travelers what are the deep tones he can produce from his throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pat and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here at the bus park next to the Porta Nuova station, four coaches leave this evening at 11.45 pm with destination Monaco, Beer Festival&quot;, arrival scheduled at 6.30 am.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are chanting with flags in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It&#39;s so loud, says Marco, that it&#39;s not for Italians.
Marco wearing a long coat lined with fake fur and a pair of glasses with wide silver ribs belong to the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for 5 years, this year it is 3 tours.
Outward journey at night, during the day to the party, return at 10.30pm.
Staying overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the trip, the welcome toast with Kaiser beer, made according to the standards of Bavarian authenticity, the health insurance fund and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave for the Brenner Pass.
There is no beer yet.
Suddenly silence falls on the bus, the travelers are asleep.
All the better, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich make a short break.
When, as planned, Marco&#39;s group arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at 6.30, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others regroup, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow cap.
On the left there is written &quot;Oktoberfest&quot; next to the internet address of Marco&#39;s travel agency: &quot;Conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second: &quot;When the doors of the beer tent open, it means running!&quot; Marco quotes early in the morning.
&quot;Run!&quot; Run and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
&quot;Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow caps sitting on the same benches, split into the adjacent space!&quot;
The mug costs 8.25 Euros, shouts Marco.
And don&#39;t forget to tip.
&quot;Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!&quot;
Third: &quot;Tonight at 10.30 pm punctually we meet again here! Got it?&quot;
We&#39;re already off to the party.
On the street one attaches yellow caps to trees, road signs and even to an advertising billboard of a large Bavarian people&#39;s party as you follow away.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the party, known as the &quot;Italian weekend&quot;.
Exact figures do not exist, there is talk of 50,000 who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tents, it is argued that 10% of visitors come from Italy on purpose.
The Munich police is reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which compiles statistics on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical treatments ahead of the British (about 60 medical treatments) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the big top of the Hofbräuhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate lenders
Germany&#39;s banking system is relatively stable, confirmed Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word &quot;relative&quot; and also hinted, that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate lender Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, obtains a billionaire credit from a consortium of German banks, in order to be able to protect itself from the turmoil on the markets.
A person expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would go up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest for the required portion.
Money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper article, the state lender has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008 the bank&#39;s reserves had decreased by 95% to 2.37 million Euros, the share of equity capital also dropped from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net rents from financial business had fallen to 0 compared to last year, profits from increases both in applications and certain shares as well as from the liquidation of loan provisions dropped more than 70% to 5 million. of Euro.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the repayment of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the consolidated text of the tax laws and from business management for business consortia, the negative profit resulted quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 got lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were spun off into Aareal Bank.
As the income in classic state funding was too low, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and private and state investor (PPP) joint project financing and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write off the value of the subsidiary, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group&#39;s profit and loss account.
The fact is that dividends have been canceled.
Already in 2007 they had been reduced by 2/3.
After the absorption of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate is an important financier of the state and of infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing among banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer escrow deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the granting of credit between banks has largely dried up, because the banks hoard liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs a part of Depfa&#39;s credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – short-term means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate&#39;s notice, the financial needs of the group have been covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected from the influence of the mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources it is heard that thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
HRE Management Committee Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE Group will not need money markets any time soon.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the marketability of the HRE Group still being ensured.
This is hoped for the bank&#39;s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be used in full.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank was reportedly close to failing on Sunday evening, the momentary bailout failed to soothe spirits.
The share price collapses by 75% on 3.30 Euros.
Mortgage prices are holding up quite well.
While the debts of an earlier degree show themselves to be almost immovable, the courses of the subordinated credits give way.
The mortgages of the subsidiary Württemberg-Hypo are particularly affected, understandably the maturities beyond 2009.
Previously, HRE mortgages seemed an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and of the institution itself, which with the relief of Depfa has married the crisis, will have to be considered dependent on the stability of the financial system international.
As long as central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, you can count on the annuities being amortized within the deadline.
Or it works, what no one dares to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But concerning information overturned due to partial nationalizations the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially give long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision of whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can carry forward losses for future payments of offsetting capital gains tax.
German special units were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in freeing the hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
We are getting more and more detailed information about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages taken.
As regards the rescue operation, what the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior mention, German special units took part in it.
In addition to specialists from the military, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as logistic experts from the technical institution were present on site.
As the spokesman for the ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages and fled.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
&quot;Luckily we didn&#39;t get there,&quot; says an Interior Ministry spokesman.
Attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian and their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in a deserted area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained secret until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, those released have arrived in Cairo in good condition.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn&#39;t explain himself on the details of the release.
There had been no information in Berlin as to when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; the 5 vacationers and the special units should leave by flight with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is supposed to show up at Tachibana Highschool on the first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German is completely &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new Exchange Log she tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I was even scared of going to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road by myself and luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
The start of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed as well as we in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 onwards, until at 8.40 a brief conversation with the professor begins, the so-called &quot;home room&quot;.
But before class started it was my turn to introduce myself.
Meanwhile, I&#39;m not the type who likes to talk in front of people, moreover in front of a class of 40 pupils
Since I didn&#39;t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from the host mother, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I sat in front of the teacher&#39;s desk and tried to pronounce correctly: &quot;Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...&quot; - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I will celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered and giggled and waved and over and over I heard the word &quot;Kawaii&quot;.
I already knew this from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means &quot;cute, sweet&quot;.
Then I quickly ran to my seat.
The girl next to me grinned, it was an honor for her to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class continued quietly, but when the gong sounded, I was literally assaulted.
They were all rambling and giggling and pestering me with questions – then it&#39;s really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother even made me a lunchbox – it&#39;s different from boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
To tell the truth, I don&#39;t even know what exactly I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
Fact is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except the salted plums, brrr!
Bento isn&#39;t just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives away a self-made Bento, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of getting to know the boy during recess.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I&#39;m just curious, if I can find out.
&quot;Why Japan in particular?&quot; my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
&quot;Because it fascinates me&quot;
Finally, I have been reading the Mangas fervently for years.
And to better understand comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started learning the Japanese language a bit.
I was completely convinced to come once.
Tradition, habits and customs also fascinate me.
Here they care a lot.
On the one hand Japan is a place of technologies and the latest trends - on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is organized well, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.&quot;
US House of Representatives rejects bailout package.
The first chamber of the US Congress has just derailed the 700 billion bailout package. dollars for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones has dropped lower.
With 206 voices against 227, the US representative house rejected the government&#39;s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the programme, which was supposed to stem the chaos on the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters desperately tried to coax critics out of the hefty $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the talks, urged deputies to consent, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It&#39;s hard to be grateful to avoid something, that hasn&#39;t arrived yet..
While the suffrage was underway the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors&#39; concerns was that the state bailout package could fail.
It recovered before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of bankruptcy, collapsed again.
Experts are now expecting further serious turmoil on the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, it must have the approval of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
1. Rats have feelings too
A rat or a cockroach runs away when they sense danger. Does it mean, that they also feel fear?
The neurological scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could we verify if, when they behave in the same way as we do, they have the same sensations as us?
The Internet journal &quot;Edge&quot; has been publishing articles by well-known scientists for several years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: &quot;What do you believe is true, without being able to prove it?&quot;
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, which I or no one else has so far been able to prove, since we can&#39;t even prove that other humans have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter impassable territory, because the baseline doesn&#39;t match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things other animals do as well. That is, he plays dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don&#39;t believe this.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human awareness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates, and among other creatures it appears to be completely absent.
At least in those aspects of our awareness that are dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, this allows for foundation on the assumption that humans differ even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should appear in man&#39;s way of speaking: given that a large part of life is linked to language, it is often said that it is linked to conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would affect it so that the animal&#39;s awareness, as it is made, surely differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
Thus it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through one&#39;s experience due to the special hardware, their pursuit will pose great problems to us.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from that there is another aspect of consciousness that would be easier for science to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short memory of primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we move first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both could be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for visualization enacting.
So what is outlined for feelings?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
What we refer to as &quot;fear&quot; is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) occupies the working memory.
Seen in this way, feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize primates and in particular human beings.
With the speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
With respect to this, Antonio Damasio for example believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the regions of the body than the sensations of the cortex and the paleocephalus, similarly to Jack Pankseep, who has however focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network hasn&#39;t changed much in the course of human evolution, this could very well be part of the sentiment extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, however I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear to rats and humans probably feels so with the senses either way: but how could that be the case, if rats and humans feel the same when do they behave similarly?
Does a cockroach flee in case of danger as if it too felt fear?
In my eyes mere similarity of behavior cannot yet demonstrate any similarity of life.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalons, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleobrain responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be demonstrated for humans: how is it that one would want to demonstrate it for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn&#39;t know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, provided that the same procedure on rats and humans is dispensed with.
Just as I don&#39;t research language and consciousness in rats, I don&#39;t research their emotions, I don&#39;t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward rather than constantly bumping into a wall.
I am precisely a practical emotional.
UEFA President Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Premier Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
&quot;The government sees UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Euros with Poland,&quot; Wasjunik said
&quot;This however is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries&quot;
Both host countries are limping on schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually the number of stadiums to be used for the European Championships will even be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can&#39;t waste any more time.
Now we have to work with maximum speed,&quot; said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
&quot;UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly&quot;
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After several scandals, the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent director Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be &quot;a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
&quot;We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the EM 2012 will not suffer.&quot;
Numerous members of the first division were convicted of manipulation last season alone, in the end the start of the league even had to be postponed until the last moment.
Promoters report increasing numbers of bookings
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to a study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly - even by more than 30% for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlook, the Germans&#39; wanderlust remains firm according to a survey.
On reservations for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as announced on Monday in Berlin by the German association for tourism DRV.
According to the survey by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking quotas for the autumn months.
Thus the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would have amounted to around 11%, the DRV communicated.
Prerequisite for these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and prepares statistical projections for the entire market.
Also included would be travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar, travel to the United States would be in particular demand, reported the DRV.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
Furthermore, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as places within Germany, would be particularly popular travel destinations among the Germans.
Especially package tours are highly valued, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be &quot;better calculable for the customers than for an individually arranged holiday&quot;.
Consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, among others, Laepple said.
The summer months also reported very good booking figures, so that there was again a turnover surplus compared to the previous year - although according to a further study, the number of Germans who went on a trip compared to the year previous fell.
Dennis Quaid retorts indignantly
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he spoke of private life and now he has trouble with his ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared her ex Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He foams in anger and retorts.
Delayed War of the Roses for the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now having a nasty fight with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the breakdown of the marriage: &quot;Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this was very painful.&quot;
The extent of the betrayals she would come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the &quot;stripping of the soul&quot; was Ryan&#39;s press work on her new film &quot;The Women&quot; - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to her being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clearly outrageous: it would be &quot;unheard of&quot;, the 54-year-old told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, for &quot;Meg for the umpteenth time to repeat and rework the story of our relation&quot;.
It would also be &quot;deplorable&quot; that Jack, their 16-year-old son together, would again &quot;be publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval a separation means for every child.&quot;
While Ryan has been living alone since the separation, Quaid is married again and will soon become the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments end with the dig: &quot;My life goes on in any case.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family with everything going so well.&quot;
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of the year 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights are even up to 50% cheaper
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial provider American Express.
The company analyzed its 2008 first-half-year booking data and after a first-quarter price hike observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, room nights in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined still rose on average by around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the reason for this as the weak dollar, which would have led to a &quot;waning desire to travel among American tourists&quot;
Even financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would be affected by the recession in hotel prices more strongly than industrial centers such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Even with regard to flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still up:
Due to higher kerosene prices, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the prices of airline tickets in Economy Class fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, in first and business class, however, the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9%, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for internal German flights, according to the study, the prices have even halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the collapse in prices would be the decline in economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure from competition due to the open skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe.
A sign of the critical situation would be the abolition of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes leaders.
At Borussia Luhukay still can&#39;t find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the crash landing for national player Marko Marin .
The Gladbach player first came into the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was precisely worded, it passed over his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right
&quot;We need the second goal,&quot; exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the corridor of the Hamburg arena booths.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the game break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist at HSV for almost 3 decades, he enjoys an even higher esteem than some old players.
And so his warning also found a hearing in the upper echelons.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave a thumbs up in approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
&quot;Everything wasn&#39;t pretty here today,&quot; admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have &quot;wanted to be more relaxed&quot;.
For the 1-nil goal, the Hamburg players had to thank Mladen Petric&#39;s (11) header and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
&quot;It was a dirty victory,&quot; summarized Martin Jol.
Hamburg&#39;s SV will turn 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves earlier, on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports club as first in the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
&quot;We can put everything right,&quot; said Marcell Jansen.
He has the feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals signed late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, goal defender Petric as well as Jansen stolen from FC Bayern – that is, slowly finds itself, but has not yet managed to shine.
&quot;We need more atmosphere and more dribbling&quot;, Jol relaunches forcefully.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits from Ballermann, beer from liter mugs and VIPs in designer Dirndlns.
A debut at the Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually have not much in common.
She is blonde, a TV presenter and wears a custom-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I&#39;m a student and my dress is second hand.
However, one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at the Wiesn, photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking pictures until the memory of the cameras is full – very flattering, and this on my first visit to the Wiesn.
That&#39;s how friends are made
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
As a tourist from the Wiesn and actually living north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress still remains within limits to this day.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, it&#39;s nothing serious
Almost everyone wears a dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – all perfectly normal.
Only my dirndl apron garners strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
A Munich woman points out to me that I would have tied my apron incorrectly: &quot;On the left you are free, in the center you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind you a widow.&quot;
I stealthily adjust the bow from behind to the left.
It&#39;s okay,&quot; he says and laughs.
Others waste less subtle flirting techniques and don sober felt hats, headed by &quot;To drunk to get dressed!&quot; and they stretch the bare backside against an uninvited one.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he is from England and he is also visiting the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it &quot;gorgeous&quot;, with a drawling &quot;ooooo&quot;..
This he tells me, after he gets rid of his pint of beer drunk earlier.
Right next to one of these fire hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
In short, Bob is one of these infamous &quot;Wildbiesler&quot;.
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol this way.
Around 8 in the evening, the sanitary workers walk in packs on the square of the party, who have to take care of the poor drunkards
Nurses appear in packs each time – always 4 at a time dragging a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works as with most visitors to the Wiesn: you go empty, you come back full.
Whoever lies under the tarp in this blood-alcohol coffin is invisible.
&quot;Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn&quot;, one of the doctors shouts at me and disappears into the chaos.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
Early news of the failure of the bailout package temporarily dropped the Dow by 700 points.
This was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later Down recovered a little again.
Around 20:30 the most important global stock market barometer quoted/surveyed with a good 5% shortfall on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq tech stock was stalled with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, losing just 14%, and the Bank of America at about a 12% loss.
No title could do it.
Shares of Goldman Sachs bank dropped by just 10%.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the bailout plan, financial funds were to be allocated for the hoarding of so-called mortgage documents
However, the sum must not be paid all at once, but in stages.
In return, the state had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an appropriate course of quotations, to reduce the charge to the state coffers.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downward spiral
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the US do not erase investors&#39; doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate plunges and tears the German stock index downwards
The American Dow Jones index loses despite the planned salvation of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pulled the German Stock Exchange index into a deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender lost 3 quarters of their value despite the bailout action by the federal government and private banks, the Commercial Bank lost more than 20%.
The German stock exchange index DAX has slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is trading with a deficit of 3.7% on 5,839 points.
World stock markets fall to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government&#39;s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to get financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3% to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of business.
The American Chamber of Deputies wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate was able to follow on October 1st.
Even the other European stock exchanges have only managed one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index has lost 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.
In Asia the benchmark index Nikkei after initial profits had a shortfall of 1.26% on 11,743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1% to 18,286.90 points.
In India the Sensex fund index lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
In the MDax, the shares of Arcandor are sold after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed for new shares in the amount of 23 million.
The business and tourism group also said its Thomas Cook stakes will not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has been perplexing scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einsteins general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe has been flying through space for almost 18 years.
Due to the fuel lines freezing quickly, she now freezes to death.
A mysterious phenomenon has been wreaking havoc among scientists for years – the anomaly of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum / thrust / swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
Thus the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as did the solar probe Ulysses.
What has amazed scholars for years: Rockets don&#39;t quite behave as one would expect according to the law of gravitation.
Indeed it comes to irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein&#39;s general theory of relativity, which describes the attractive force of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes as firmly as before that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have sighted in the cosmos.
&quot;Responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth,&quot; he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
A force of attraction evidently emanates from her, the effect of which on the other celestial bodies is evident.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation whatsoever, especially any visible light.
According to scientists&#39; calculations, dark matter makes up at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the release, 6 kidnappers are reported to have been killed.
In southern Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the redemption are already underway.
The Germans are always targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported in agreement by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the report by the Italian television station Sky TG 24: &quot;Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed
We are examining their state of health&quot; Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts are said to be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of an expedition in the desert turn out to be already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages remains unclear: therefore the kidnappers, following the indications of an Egyptian public security agent, would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise .
&quot;The problem had been solved.
They agreed for a ransom,&quot; the official said.
It would have &quot;still only been a matter of taking the hostages over&quot;, when suddenly &quot;this surprise&quot; arrived.
Sudanese soldiers Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot dead 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money was supposed to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot; reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to remain held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to comment on the report.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the crash on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital, Romford but died soon after.
After the crash, a 51-year-old man was arrested on careless driving charges.
He was released on bail.
Stepfather&#39;s abuse &#39;led to suicide&#39;
Years of stepfather abuse led to woman killing herself, a court has found.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for 6 years after admitting to eight cases of sexual assault.
Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: &quot;I feel responsible for her death.&quot;
The court learned that Miss Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007, aged 34.
When she was a child and living in Coventry, Trerise molested and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was away working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse they had caused her.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends of Miss Randle, who had been an accomplished surfer and cyclist, was &quot;emotionally dead&quot;, and that she had &quot;given up on life&quot;.
In April 2007 her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
She is thought to have suffocated to death on a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession which ended: &quot;I bound and blindfolded her.&quot;
&quot;I did not sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: &quot;You are an extremely strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
&quot;This unfortunate saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Harder still is the fact that if he hadn&#39;t done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up in court.&quot;
I note the effects that Stephanie&#39;s father and mother describe having had on their daughter over the years.
&quot;Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman.&quot;
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June faces charges under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the charges made under this law and there is nothing to suggest criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
&quot;They would have thought this was being dealt with internally in the Mod and the Cabinet Office,&quot; he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police due to the highly sensitive nature of his job.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq&#39;s security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to an undisclosed location.
Building companies face the B&amp;B bill
UK building companies could face a bill of more than £80,000 after the Bradford &amp; Bingley bank bailout.
The Government has given £14bn to protect the deposits of 2.6m savers at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the savers&#39; money, including the 59 building societies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) chief executive Adrian Coles said it was &quot;infuriating&quot; that the companies and their members have to pay.
The £14bn loan will eventually be paid off when Bradford &amp; Bingley&#39;s mortgages are paid off.
But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will accrue in the meantime will be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies would be included in that number.
It is galling that those institutions which have been prudent ... are now called upon to foot part of the bill of those institutions which have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies between them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450m in 2009.
This means that the companies will need to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the association of construction companies, told the BBC he believed it was unfair.
&quot;It&#39;s galling that those institutions that have been playing conservatively in the recovering housing market are now having to foot part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.&quot;
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since filings began in 1945.
&quot;We need to look into all aspects over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a significant bill,&quot; added Mr Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 a full year&#39;s interest will be due and this could be almost twice as much.
Since building societies are mutual organizations with no shareholders, their members end up footing the bill through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Turkey is broadening its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 paces into Asia, lies one of the finest relics of this failed imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-Renaissance style.
At least that&#39;s what the guidebooks tell you.
The building straddles the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial town halls.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building slightly run down.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, there&#39;s no doubting the magnitude of the enterprise of what used to be the westernmost passageway.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a latecomer to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by means of this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany&#39;s imperial ambitions foundered during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
Its relative isolation from the surrounding region, spawned by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed
British and domineering forces advanced out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha Station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly fallen apart, largely overtaken by history.
But nowadays, this rail outlet to Anatolia and all points to the east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey&#39;s ever-widening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, engendered by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
There is now a new engagement policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping car for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP&#39;s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride along the tracks that produced the old-world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular state bent on turn away from its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in the Turkish consensus.
It has prompted some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - purpose-built - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and power bakeries, where business-suited managers - both men and women - meet to make contracts in the early morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I&#39;m sure he had a Blackberry too.
&quot;The aim of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly,&quot; he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Today it has to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn&#39;t the case for one or the other.
It must be both.
&quot;But surely at some point,&quot; I ask, &quot;Turkey will be forced to decide?&quot;
&quot;Turkey,&quot; he says, &quot;doesn&#39;t want where to make that choice.&quot;
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I spoke to here recited by heart: the ties of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, benefit Europe and the United States as much as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, All of Europe can metaphorically run those train lines eastward through Asia and into the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had looked at this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to find that Europe&#39;s Middle Eastern ambitions may now be, in large part, in Turkey&#39;s hands.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was always called &quot;the sick man of Europe&quot;.
At the time, at least, there seemed to be no question as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating country.
Milk goes up to 5p a litre
People in Jersey are facing having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced there will be a hike in the wholesale prices of its milk by an extra five pence a liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, following a twopence rise in February, and comes after research by a consultancy firm.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase onto their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladesh court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges pending against her.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country&#39;s military-backed interim government first give her total freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on parole, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal the High Court order to the Supreme Court.
&quot;The high court rejected Sheikh Hasina&#39;s bail application on the grounds that she cannot have bail as she is already abroad on parole for medical treatment,&quot; said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
&quot;We will appeal the High Court order.&quot;
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s return home is expected after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took over, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all allegations against themselves.
Fear of the Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN rolled out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said it cannot reach children in southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said it came despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission&#39;s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB has been told by the competition appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the commission said BSkyB&#39;s participation hampered competition and allowed unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal which effectively blocked NTL, now rebranded as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB&#39;s stake in ITV cast doubt on ITV&#39;s independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the buyout.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the case by the US prosecutor
The US Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine US lawyers in 2006.
The operation came as a report on the case by the Justice Department&#39;s inspector general criticized the actions of the administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fears that the prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
&quot;Serious allegations involving potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or discharged,&quot; Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine US prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it later emerged that the fired lawyers had been rated no worse than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the firing was politically motivated.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-profile Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate allegations of defrauding Democratic voters.
US prosecutors investigate and pursue court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, got caught up in the firestorm, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials resigned.
(The Inspector General&#39;s report was highly critical of Mr. Gonzales&#39; role in the case, saying he had primary responsibility for the layoffs, had abdicated his leadership role and been extraordinarily aloof during the trial.
Other officials, including former Bush senior aide Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s epic will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for his anthemic epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will accept his special gold award at next week&#39;s ceremony in London, said he was &quot;honored&quot; to earn the accolade.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track from Meat Loaf&#39;s 1977 hit album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year&#39;s awards, being shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: &quot;There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.&quot;
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required strong vocals which were provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted nearly two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf&#39;s album Bat Out Of Hell spent nearly nine years on the charts and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other cross streets, some famous, some merely for use.
But even many veteran cab drivers and longtime residents find it difficult to give Extra Place&#39;s location, mostly because they&#39;ve never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street – not making Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than a bustling thoroughfare.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it in a normal atlas.
The street must, however, have admirers.
For example, there&#39;s Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Street.
They want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques due to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the truncated street simply because it was one of the last remnants of the former genteel neighborhood.
But the city&#39;s conservation and development department, which controls the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
Representatives from the city and Avalon Bay agency outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the streets during a meeting of the Boundary City Commission&#39;s land use committee.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in city hands, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
&quot;There is very little space left for city ownership, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,&quot; he said.
&quot;There might be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.&quot;
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it would reopen the small street and install seating, including some for use in a café that the developer hopes to lease the space to.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the road was first made public at this month&#39;s meeting.
Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokesman, said that although the company wants to use the road, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s main concern is to renovate this derelict alleyway and turn it into a public amenity,&quot; he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Preservation Lodgings, said it was the city&#39;s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency&#39;s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his many sons and the narrow strip of land went unclaimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is perhaps best known as the set for the Ramones album cover photo &quot;Rocket to Russia.&quot;
&quot;The ground was beautiful,&quot; said Danny Fields, the Ramones&#39; manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
&quot;It was full of rubbish, shreds of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes.&quot;
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about &quot;gentrifying&quot; the East Village, have resisted the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the publicly owned piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have lauded Extra Place as a rarity – an almost unchanged fragment of a city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah&#39;s Vanishing New York (subtitled, &quot;The Book of Laments: A Slightly Nostalgic Look at the Vanishing City&quot;), published part of a City History Speech that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even by day and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, with weeks-old newspapers fluttering along the slums.&quot;
With a few exceptions, the street looked almost the same as it did on a recent evening.
A rat scurried across the back street near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an upscale clothes shop.
There was graffiti on the walls and an empty 22oz beer bottle lies next to a pile of fresh, abandoned newspapers.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place but suggest it could do with some sprucing up.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the street&#39;s appeal in its current state.
&quot;The best years of my life,&quot; she said, &quot;were in black, dirty, disgusting places.&quot;
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Education Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior fellow in California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book &quot;Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School .&quot;
Truly attracting Hispanic voters is tricky business.
Barack Obama&#39;s educational projects are a case in point.
Mr. Obama&#39;s campaign notes that, &quot;African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving goals, Obama&#39;s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for English learners.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom instruction in languages other than English, overrides his interest in closing learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The school&#39;s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students passed the high-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
An equally astounding 93 percent of fourth graders took the English-speaking-art expert level test.
This amazing result was achieved by using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama&#39;s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and practice, constant skill assessment, and a &quot;no excuses&quot; attitude.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street director, the school&#39;s disruptive approach to English learners is &quot;full immersion.&quot;
Usage of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, &quot;We had fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you had walked into the class 12 months later you wouldn&#39;t have been able to pinpoint which one it was.&quot; .
&quot;It works,&quot; he noted, &quot;it works for us.&quot;
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools with English students?
The school&#39;s achievements make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations are a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent it from predict Mr. Obama&#39;s response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently trivialized the topic when he said people should stop worrying about &quot;English-only&quot; legislation.
Instead, he said, &quot;you need to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish.&quot;
If Obama truly wants to close these achievement gaps, he should look carefully at educational models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday on concerns that even a US bailout for financial markets may fail to lift the economy.
Crude futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Merchant Exchange in morning trading.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
For the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 a barrel in June, prices tumbled to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month before rallying once more amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety swayed investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they reached a weekend deal on the bailout, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest installment of the rolling merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said frantic weekend trading led to a bailout deal &quot;appear to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to calm down.
&quot;The outlook for global equity, interest rates and foreign exchange markets has become uncertain,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
&quot;We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a commodity perspective, our most pressing concern is how far the US virus will spread globally and specifically to China. &quot;
Banking analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption slows due to slowing economic growth, trimming oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time in a Jets uniform than anyone in the past eight-plus seasons, defensive back Shaun Ellis thought he&#39;d seen it all.
Then he watched Sunday&#39;s second quarter unfold as the Jets turned a scoreless game into a comeback.
&quot;Never seen anything like it,&quot; Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had matched the grayness of the brooding clouds with sluggish play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon in which their growing chemistry took a giant leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback was down and another with 10 seconds left in the first half.
&quot;I haven&#39;t gone off my path,&quot; Favre said of all the passes that came to Coles.
He&#39;s a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think.&quot;
While Favre and Coles made catch plays, the defense hit hard for Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a loose pass and rethrown it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith predicted another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a fumble from Warner.
The last turnover, Bowens&#39; forced fumble, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals took the lead on that possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets got the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a try from 20 yards, for a 34 to 0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe his insanity, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, &quot;The second quarter or the third quarter?&quot;
When told both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, &quot;I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.&quot;
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time.&quot;
Rested Gebrselassie surpasses his world record
Ethiopia&#39;s Haile Gebrselassie showed again why many consider him the best marathon runner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile run under 2 hours 4 minutes .
With a win on the favorably flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shatters his previous time of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record of a career so jaw-dropping it has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing — perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would make her asthma problems worse.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In nearly perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a searing average of 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
As half-distance runners like Gebrselassie and Kenya&#39;s Paul Tergat went long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Brazil&#39;s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998 .
After Sunday&#39;s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his calves and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left it fresh, not rusty.
&quot;I am so happy,&quot; Gebrselassie told reporters.
&quot;Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and had some doubts today, but in the end everything went well.&quot;
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s East African rival - for overly orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world&#39;s top star marathon runners, relying on pacers as if it were a middle-distance race, and placing world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie&#39;s prowess as a marathon runner.
With pace set by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, kept Gebrselassie in competition after the frontrunners faded.
With just over three miles to go, Gebrselassie made a final surge to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best time by nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, capped off a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was an upset winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is being described as a bad crash, but recovered to win in Berlin, setting her personal best time by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran one race math right, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners start with a large gap, catching them after about 18 1/2 miles.
Ethiopia&#39;s Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second in 2:21.31, while Kenya&#39;s Helena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and trials of a black life
Tucked away in the sprawling theme park on the Orlando suburbs, just miles from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black incorporated city in the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer quite as simple as she described it in 1935: &quot;the city of five lakes, three croquet lawns, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no jail.&quot;
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival at Eatonville to show their respects to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city it described—and which makes tourists stop by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers&#39; Project—remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who &quot;knowing so little about us, doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s missing.&quot; .&quot;
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called in to keynote address on race, many here remain wary of the outsider&#39;s gaze.
&quot;We are very careful about how our story is told,&quot; said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city&#39;s oldest church.
&quot;It has to be right.&quot;
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and hardship.
It is both a historic model of black takeover and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an oak-shaded example of rural Southern black culture - sometimes scorned, sometimes rewarded - born out of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville&#39;s image really began with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through earnest, dialect-rich books such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Rout 17, a road that runs through the oft-forgotten center of Florida into a backdrop of black history and human drama
Low as a bass drum in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the shop owned by Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clarke, then detoured into more private areas.
&quot;Off the road to the left,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is the modern public school, brown with white trim, with its well-kept gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always tended, thinking he could scarcely read and write.&quot;
She also mentioned Widow Dash&#39;s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn &quot;sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the walk-through rooms.&quot;
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor&#39;s.
Indeed, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
&quot;Zora was saying it like it was,&quot; said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson&#39;s girls whom Hurston immortalizes by quoting men singing crass songs about their beauty.
Adds: &quot;Some people don&#39;t like it.&quot;
Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned to her family who moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston swooped into town, he routinely arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing slacks in a city that even today prides itself on decent dress.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin says, while others chuckled.
&quot;People were always very happy to see Zora,&quot; Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, rocking back in his chair on the back patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, &quot;she never stayed long.&quot;
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Though she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no big memorial services, and no big conferences.
&quot;I don&#39;t think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy at all,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows,&quot; a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change came in the 80s.
Orange County officials wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
Orlando&#39;s expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 through the city&#39;s western limit.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the community&#39;s relative idyllic isolation
In the 1950s, the battle over miscegenation brought hatred to the community&#39;s doorstep.
&quot;During that time, a bunch of white kids came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side,&quot; says Mr. Franklin.
&quot;We actually had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a watermelon from a car.&quot;
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown v. Board of Education &quot;an insult rather than an honor to my race.&quot;
Residents now say the desegregation of the schools, while they have been positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville&#39;s cohesion and threatens the confidence of its young people.
&quot;Black kids used to be hugged — I remember this — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher at night,&quot; said NY Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
&quot;You didn&#39;t hug your white teacher because your white teacher…- I mean, there&#39;s a cultural divide there,&quot; Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and made room for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudice, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like, &quot;How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can&#39;t understand.&quot;
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out on a long journey to Hurston&#39;s unmarked grave and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway hit bookstore shelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The freeway project came just as its most famous daughter had re-entered the limelight.
And this time, Hurston&#39;s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what could wreak havoc on the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state backed out of its road plan.
&quot;The five-lane resurrected highway has brought what one would say high speed, a real pride for the city,&quot; said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it simpler: &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
Victory over the highway project has helped change the city&#39;s self-image.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historic register in 1998.
A new single-story bookstore (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a repaved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: Just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can feel like a back street in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She&#39;s 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to seek out Eatonville&#39;s history, for its significance, are often still treated with caution.
Advance permission is required for most interviews, but some things—like the murals on Eatonville&#39;s oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields—aren&#39;t allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a plump schoolteacher with a penchant for bright red, still fear their island community is being misunderstood.
Yet as the Hurston festival has expanded, a high level of city pride has also emerged.
Young people, especially, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston—she saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and all, no better, no worse, and proud and creative and hard working and foolish and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
Genuine civic affection can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin&#39;s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need of help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;A lot of people, if they&#39;ve just walked in here, will think, &#39;Oh, this town is nothing compared to all the others,&#39;&quot; said Alondra Kenon after mass on a recent Sunday.
&quot;But if you really stop and take a moment to look at the history, it really is a lovely city.&quot;
Here in New York we are all fluent in finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were in the eye of the storm.
They would never guess that the glass offices, honeycombed over their heads bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York every day experience the worst &quot;bad day at the office&quot; since the crash of 1929.
Bellhops shake metal tea carts across the sidewalks, carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans shuffle between apartment buildings carrying, like human mules, 50-odd pressed shirts hung on a stick on their backs.
Office workers still wait in line for their morning bagel at sidewalk food carts, and it&#39;s still impossible to catch a yellow cab between 4 and 7 pm on a workday.
It didn&#39;t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of doom and gloom, I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had timed the affair to coincide with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier&#39;s desk, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service desk, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy&#39;s Department Store, and new customers open accounts.
Many of those ahead of me, I would later learn from Starr, my &quot;trusted banker,&quot; were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, however, they&#39;ve already pulled savings from smaller banks from places they commute from, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from so-called thrifts (sort of like a construction company), credit unions and city savings bank types whose branches operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family .
In the past year, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been placed into receivership, and as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer to bail it out.
The clerks and clerks who stood before me, fearful of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is bailing the most on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become proficient in finance in recent weeks.
A woman at my favorite Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the nearly 50-year-old uniformed concierge at my apartment building, changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, &quot;Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I changed, I&#39;m not taking any risks.&quot;
Lives Remembered: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford Music Director from 1962, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, he founded his own wonderful youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
They were supposedly under-21/under-21, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, many of us were well into our twenties - we simply refused to give up the chorus.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (the mythological mutable-being) represented the willingness of the choir and the ability to tackle anything the music presented to do, whether madrigals or Messiaen, unaccompanied or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all due to that man&#39;s inspiration and enthusiasm for music which remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often we were told by Tod to &#39;let the music speak for itself&#39;.
He had said: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.
It&#39;s all there in the music.
So sing it!&quot;
His technique in using the wand was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flowery.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it higher and higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If one conductor were to be knighted it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 plus years I have watched over 100 of his concerts and can honestly say I have never disagreed with a single one - and many times been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal grandeur and modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply &quot;rode around the world a well-known workhorse or two.&quot;
He will be missed by so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) specifies that &quot;in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a research fellow at Houblon-Norman ... studying at the same time for a science, an arts and a PhD&quot;.
This follows from Woodruff&#39;s author&#39;s note in Beyond Nab End, but is incorrect.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor JD Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the USA as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career is unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, left of Austria&#39;s right wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium&#39;s right-wing Vlaams Belang party take part in a rally to present the organization &#39;Cities against Islamisation&#39; in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry signs like road signs representing mosques with a red line running through them.
Police have blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties gained big in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were badly damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz in a few hours between Friday night and this morning in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise extremist motives driven by a hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by news of the desecration, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria meanwhile has embarked on a journey of spiritual quest following its rightward shift in yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the head of the Freedom Party which won more than 18 percent of the vote, has campaigned against headscarves and burkas and has also voiced his opposition to foods that are perceived to be connected to Islam.
At the final rally in Vienna, he spoke of a &quot;European brotherhood&quot; to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the building of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analysis done immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation&#39;s strongest political bloc, indicated that the change was being driven predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities supervising him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The ban on overseas travel was granted to Kent Police last Thursday after they provided prosecutors with evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning&#39;s solicitors.
A Court Service spokesman said: &quot;On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Magistrates Court, Kent Police lodged an application to prevent Mr Paul Gadd&#39;s overseas travel to France and Spain until 25 March.
&quot;Paul Gadd was not present in person.&quot;
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicted sex offenders.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give the police seven days notice of his intended departure date.
Failure to notify the authorities can lead to a five-year prison sentence.
Kent Police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter&#39;s possible travel around the country.
A Kent Police spokesman said: &quot;Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
&quot;From our point of view, it&#39;s easier to screen someone who stays in the UK because we have comprehensive systems in place to manage any potential risk more effectively.
&quot;Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not let him through passport control and he eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his solicitor David Corker went to Uxbridge court, west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him in the convict register. for sexual offences.
Glitter was previously jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A Home Office source said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was reassured and delighted that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
&quot;I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character&quot; Günther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor premiere dresses.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand the artist.
On the other, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they don&#39;t have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in &quot;Flamenco-People&quot; alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the Flamenco Photography Month program, reflects the international importance of this dance, which is growing every day,&quot; explains the artist and clarifies that in &quot;Flamenco-People&quot; it could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists or performers on stage.
These people portrayed &quot;on the street&quot; are &quot;artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and captivating the public.
To grasp the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personalities of flamenco greats on camera.&quot;
With a passion for the &quot;Cante de las Minas&quot; festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits which, due to the type of camera and the material, are reminiscent of classic photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer&#39;s own conception of flamenco: &quot;A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day.&quot;
Not the dancing, singing or playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of conquering the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, feature in this selection of around seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited at the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with &quot;Portraits of Veteran Athletes&quot; (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although in &quot;Flamenco-People&quot; the concept is different, the photographer admits &quot;I love portraying people, getting to know them and being able to penetrate their lives for a moment, be it a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you sometimes don&#39;t even know or who only give you a few minutes to take the picture.
Regardless of these circumstances, like a photographer, I always try to materialize my ideas.&quot;
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, at number 20 in via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16th.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a &quot;gambling&quot;
It&#39;s set in places he doesn&#39;t know yet and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is grappling with a new project he&#39;s working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always favored for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia that the project he is working on today &quot;is a gamble&quot; and that &quot;everything indicates that I shouldn&#39;t write it.&quot;
&quot;If I had common sense, I wouldn&#39;t write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible,&quot; concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing through the city of &#39;Aqueduct a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of &quot;La ciudad y los perros&quot; was, as expected, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival&#39;s prize for being the most voted writer by attendees – an early edition of Dickens&#39; &#39;Our mutual friend&#39;, filled the seats at the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of an audience whose time flew by when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and large doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the &quot; extraordinary adventure&quot; of the &quot;pleasure of reading&quot; and &quot;of living beyond what I used to live&quot;; as he writes in a &quot;disciplined way&quot; to make up for the &quot;lack of inspiration&quot;, with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous remaking; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how &quot;the images of memory&quot; are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that &quot;there is no way&quot; to measure and know if books can change people&#39;s lives, &quot;but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience, &quot; underlined Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, &quot;it has effects&quot; and that &quot;it makes people more nonconformist.&quot; This is why he invited writers not to &quot;give in to frivolity&quot; and to &quot;take responsibility&quot; for their own vocation.
The weather hampers the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of bullfights
The bullfighting celebration that was supposed to seal the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, has decided to suspend the celebration of bullfighting.
The bad weather has raged against this Festival preventing us from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
On the bill were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were due to face a Castilblanco bull.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being carried out in triumph, after bullfighting with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante completed his two bullfights, earning greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than by the bullfight itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing from the Los Llanos arena ingloriously and without penalty.
With the second bull, after a tremendous muleta, he earned the boos of a large part of the public.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish passes the checkpoint in Alava
Five to ten in the morning.
The agents call a halt to the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, flee.
The agents ordered a halt to the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After chasing them, the agents manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of around 28, identified as AAJ, according to a statement from the Basque government&#39;s Interior Department.
The arrested individual is charged with drug trafficking and falsifying public documents.
The incident occurred when Alava road officials were carrying out a transport check on the N-1, where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, defying orders, accelerated sharply and passed the checkpoint.
The agents gave chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometres, stopped at the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then succeeded in arresting one of the fugitives and seizing the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying. Once they inspected the van, they took note of it, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish patties, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for a thorough investigation and weighting.
Furthermore, since the officials ascertained that the registration number had been &quot;duplicated&quot; since it did not coincide with the one shown in the van&#39;s documentation, the arrested person was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The 28-year-old AAJ prisoner was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers as she tried to drive her car out of the parking lot in Montecito, a California highway spokesman revealed to People magazine.
The witness specified that around 4.30 pm Locklear &quot;was pushing the accelerator hard, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking space with sudden maneuvers back and forth. Backing up, she passed several times in front of her sunglasses .&quot;
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first glance, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby street and exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted 911 because &quot;she was concerned for Locklear&#39;s life.&quot;
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
&quot;She looked confused,&quot; which is why officers took her to a drug and alcohol center for testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the hypothesis of excessive alcohol was dismissed from the outset, although &quot;according to what the officers initially observed, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug.&quot;
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unspecified substance and was committed to the local jail at around 7pm, to be released hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was recovered from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the UI to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of education to take a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following allegations of cronyism.
&quot;In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities,&quot; said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against the former councilor in the Sevillian council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for &quot;transparency&quot; in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva allegedly committed. &quot;UI has always wanted these types of investigations to be as transparent as possible.&quot;
He likewise stressed that training is governed by &quot;very stringent ethical codes for all public offices.&quot;
&quot;Sangre de mayo&quot;, Garci&#39;s epic wager
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós&#39; Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci re-proposes in Sangre de mayo the famous revolt of the Spaniards against the French, in what is the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
With this film, the director has attempted to &quot;illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis&quot; that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, starring Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in cinemas, to eventually become a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós&#39; literature, Jose Luis Garci claims that with this film he has made &quot;a dream of his childhood&quot; come true, and believes he has to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years earlier to shoot a commemorative film for the second centenary of 2 May medrilegno. The director agreed on the condition that the story be based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated in full by the Community of Madrid represented a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; for Garci to recreate the appropriate sets and costumes to portray a &quot;a stunned Spain that made the wrong choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII,&quot; noted Garci.
However, the director regrets not having received the same funding as Alatriste or Los phantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes foreseen by the scenography that he himself had signed together to Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
For the director of Volver a empezar, this influenced what is his usual working practice, staging with actors, with whom he often rehearses before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it &quot;humbling,&quot; considering that &quot;part of a director&#39;s job is going to the theater and the cinema to find out what&#39;s happening in the industry in which he works.&quot;
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, rehearse in front of his camera, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Nominated for an Oscar four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year - his Sangre de mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, last selected Los sunflowers ciegos -, do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema &quot;which should be known instead.&quot;
Garci does not expect awards from this film.
&quot;At first you think you&#39;re working for posterity, then you realize you&#39;re only working for prosperity, and at some point you settle down to just making one more film,&quot; explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Sevillian essence of the Tortola Valencia dancer
A Sevillian dancer pays homage to another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three she moved with her family to London.
She was a free dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She led a glamorous life and was a pioneer of women&#39;s empowerment, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and advocated for the abolition of the corset which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
&quot;I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible to me.&quot;
The dancer claims: &quot;we don&#39;t intend to tell her entire life, but to collect its spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of flamenco.
Thus, &quot;la danza de la mariposa&quot; suggested a guajira, or &quot;la danza de la serpiente&quot; some tangos.
His dancing was sensual, and I&#39;m told my dancing also fits into this aesthetic,&quot; she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in &quot;La puerta abierta&quot;; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one who had been one of her pupils.
&quot;Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I&#39;m happy because he accepted to work in my work and I feel very honored for this.&quot;
The staging also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez &quot;who plays the role of eternal accompanist of these artists who have been all-round divas, and who have always had many suitors. &quot;
The life of this woman is also present in some form in the work which takes place in distant places, particularly for that era, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since, usually , resided in London.
&quot;I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her, much less considers her work as something of value,&quot; says Bayon.
The show will start today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
&quot;I recommend José Vicente Resino&#39;s exhibition &quot;Flamenco y vida&quot; because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are extraordinary.
They caught my attention for the simplicity and power they convey, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments.&quot;
With the publication of the &quot;Diario de un poet recién casado&quot; the Triennium also ends
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the &quot;Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado&quot; at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Department of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia for celebrate the &quot;Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon&quot; (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize for literature and that of both of their deaths.
Thus, the &quot;Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon&quot; concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel house-museum and with the traveling exhibition &quot;Juan Ramón Jiménez : Aquel chopo de luz&quot;, which was inaugurated last May and which, after visiting the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Department of Culture of the Andalusian Council has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the &quot;Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado&quot;, edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.&quot;
The phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on &quot;Ausencia de malicia&quot; and gives an idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone left.
Yet it cost him a lot to give him an Oscar.
And since 2007 he was retired.
And it was also known that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
&quot;Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,&quot; cried Robert Redford, &quot;my life and my country have been better off because of his existence.&quot;
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and of the country has died in a particularly dark moment, for fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-esteem of the American people on the ground, desperately looking for new reasons to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtues and still people to be admired, you don&#39;t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and champion of causes lost and won, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of an overdose to the creation of the homemade, organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, regardless of nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man has died, an era has ended.
Another Brit, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the pinnacle of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has ventured to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
&quot;He left an example of the highest level for all of us,&quot; observes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and to have a serious and distant private life to the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today&#39;s media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He was divorced once but married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful while certainly not lacking opportunities not to be.
&quot;Why do I go out to eat burgers today, if I have a steak at home?&quot; used to joke.
In heaven accompanies him the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
&quot;Of all the great roles he played, none was he more proud of than that of devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and passionate philanthropist,&quot; they say.
The imperfect run of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday&#39;s run, I would say absolutely not!
They called it the &quot;perfect ride&quot; but in my opinion it was by far the worst I&#39;ve ever witnessed.
A bunch of nonsense, which if they were later taken into consideration in the evaluation and I had to examine them, the response would be absolutely negative.
But let&#39;s go in order and starting from the beginning.
The nonsense started with the withdrawal of the lat, which assumed you go first.
It didn&#39;t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, let it be to collect everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
But no.
You had to go just to get the bib (first silly, go just for that) and (after the related queue), surprise! they only had size &#39;S&#39; shirts (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the crisis to blame if they have decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are trifles compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to get the chip, the waiting queue was 15 minutes and, on top of that, you had to deposit your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected to attract more than 11,000 people.
Then, as was to be expected, the race began when we hadn&#39;t even deposited the backpack yet, although, once we had succeeded, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and storming of the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will surely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the classification in the correct order due to the chip which, I suppose, did not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect ride, it certainly won&#39;t enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for (virtual) receptionists
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in Microsoft&#39;s case, a shuttle service to get around the company&#39;s campus) by assisting the telephone user.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this &quot;receptionist&quot; is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
It can also group attendees into conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that she does not belong to the group she is speaking to and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she&#39;s there to visit someone and tells her he&#39;ll be available to her shortly.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, like the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won&#39;t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers were equipped with the essentials and less loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for &quot;the least&quot;.
All a discovery, if we consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added features and &quot;extras&quot; to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the net, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google&#39;s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to the mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week backs up that notion.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time surfing the net than in a remote windowed environment.
What are half of the operating system applications for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a viable alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and here&#39;s a small example.
I took the photograph featured in this post at one of Microsoft&#39;s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a sign urges them to use its search tool - &quot;Your search. Our future&quot;.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to search the web.
Last week, moreover, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be released in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is increasingly becoming a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso took it to the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick&#39;s &#39;Diamante de sangre&#39;, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &#39;The Godfather&#39; as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the strongman with a pointed mustache who lifts weights in the traveling circus.
In essence, it is the typical men&#39;s t-shirt, with a cotton lining, tight-fitting and without sleeves.
It&#39;s the &#39;tank&#39;, as English speakers call it, although, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all others.
The &quot;Marcel&quot; excels over the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most emblematic models of the T-shirt wear as a detail on the neck .
The &quot;Marcel&quot; excels over the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag, which the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck .
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not concern only the famous &quot;tanks&quot;.
Also includes varsity sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, chinos, sailor tops, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Undergarments designed to be comfortable.
And it&#39;s a pity to use them as underwear.
They are too beautiful.
Second assault for Honda supersales
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new minivan has an even larger interior space.
To all must be added a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before moving on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation entered the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique sales phenomenon.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and again in 2008.
Almost one million units of the Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will help increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda&#39;s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish branch expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, company executives expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a drop of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Furthermore, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4.37 meters long - of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For the markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first few months of the year, immediately after the company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 metres.
Along with the increase in size, the living space also expands.
This advantage derives on the one hand from the inclusion of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
Furthermore, the luggage compartment capacity - equipped with a double background - rises to 399 litres, ie 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in terms of accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees on the first Jazz.
Furthermore, the engines in this second generation of the jazz are also new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology which makes it possible to lower fuel consumption, produce fewer carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keep the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model allows you to take advantage of a power of 90 HP at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of around 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horsepower in the first generation model, 100 are now available.
The 100 horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
&quot;I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn&#39;t worry me&quot;
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than pretty girls and celebrities who lend their names to them.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango brand made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins you over quickly.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the Mango autumn-winter season, as well as to attend the presentation of the second edition of the &#39;Mango Fashion Awards&#39; and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let&#39;s say, a very intense day, but at the same time exciting.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s cinema, we get various inspirations from here.
Then, I love getting lost in the city and observing how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes. I do it frequently.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you are a very versatile woman, aren&#39;t you?
I think so, even if in the end, everything comes together and there are many elements in common.
Since I was a child, I have liked dresses; I wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s house to rummage through my aunt&#39;s wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I&#39;ve always paid close attention to dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and essays, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And as an actress, when you get your wardrobe delivered, that&#39;s when you really meet the character.
So, it all goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30, did you get into a crisis?
Hand.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have good experience to savor life by making less than mistakes.
The biological clock doesn&#39;t scare me.
I did the things I wanted from an early age and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking of becoming a mother, or not?
Of course, I know I&#39;m going to be a mother because my own body is asking me and I also want to be a young mother, I don&#39;t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I don&#39;t worry too much.
What I will do is give a lot of happiness to my son and educate him with a lot of love.
As for cinema, you are waiting for some films shot last year to come out in different theaters.
That&#39;s right, and I really want them to come out.
As a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can&#39;t always be like this.
I want &quot;La última hora&quot; and &quot;En busca de la tumba de Cristo&quot; to come out.
Let&#39;s see if you like them
A few days ago you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don&#39;t say that.
It&#39;s not like I was on the runway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity fashion show for her organization &#39;Women for a Better World&#39; and the dresses we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - were auctioned off to raise money for this Naomi&#39;s NGO.
People don&#39;t know this soft side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can tell you that they are not so true.
Also, I&#39;m with this good side that she&#39;s involved in.
He asked me to walk for a noble cause, but if he&#39;d asked me to be a pine tree, I would have done it anyway.
If it&#39;s to help third world women, there&#39;s no turning back.
The &quot;ape car&quot; to avoid collisions
As part of the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of bees as an example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center developed this small robot in collaboration with the Science and Technology Research Center of the prestigious Tokyo University in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, director general of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan&#39;s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to avoid collisions in manufacturer vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the bees&#39; compound eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers devised what they termed a laser range finder.
This mechanism identifies the obstacles that are in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor which immediately allows prevent collision.
&quot;The moment it senses an obstacle, the little robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid a collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
&#39;If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,&#39; explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot swerve up or down, or even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which its wheels can turn and not taking advantage of infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, as well as acceleration and deceleration, so that the little robot can avoid collisions.
&quot;This device just needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn&#39;t require memorization of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can run without interruptions and with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we&#39;re not talking gigabytes of storage, or even megabytes.&quot;
It is the first step in developing new technologies for instantaneous collision avoidance, a technology Nissan hopes will be standard in automobiles within ten years.
The robot uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than lithium-ion types.
Another potential future application of this technology could be integrating the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles in their path.
Drivers who repeat alcoholism will have to install the &quot;alcolock&quot;
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative fines for excessive blood alcohol levels to install a system in their car that prevents driving while intoxicated or if one does not blow into the device.
The provision was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the State Attorney General&#39;s Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The aim of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving while intoxicated then go back to driving the car.
The alcohol lock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled breath and prevents you from starting the car if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices allow for a reduction of up to 65% of infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out in the ordinary way, and, undoubtedly, the reform necessary for the penal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative by the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without &quot;peep-toes&quot;
With British punctuality, at 17.40, according to schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you won&#39;t be able to go to the airport to load people at that moment ... Are you from here or ...
- No, no sir, she is Spanish, but lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good ...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the airport hangar pressed against the red carpet and the military cordon made up of 27 marines who offer the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with hair in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual &quot;peep-toes,&quot; perhaps she was told that bad weather was threatening in Mexico City.
They give the photographers a smile and a brief stop before moving on to the hall where the official group awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a witty Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Tremble before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the United States Department of the Treasury, in addition to possessing a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from committing themselves to junk mortgages in doubtfully insolvent banks, they have created an entertaining and educational game for network users: &quot;Bad Credit Hotel&quot;.
In other words, the &quot;Hotel of bad credits&quot;...or problems.
The gloomy appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to make you think not once, but twice or even three times before asking for a loan.
And most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary focus.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not very detailed.
It&#39;s more of a teen page than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, a songo room appears inside the hotel.
It&#39;s still something, because buying a better house is out of the question...
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and good-natured designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to encourage the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the window of Mango at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the company&#39;s second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with an extension of 1,335 square metres.
The first is located in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the competition jury, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite canvases of Chagal, the gala presidential table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making a virtue of necessity, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a suit of the House and some breathtaking ELAH accessories and on the arm of his son Luis - a big boy almost two meters tall - he accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the homage dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors of the house and as knight as he is he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and a shirt – designed by her hand – transformed for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work , when we were shown to the ballet recital room and she, remembering other times, grabbed a barre and sketched a &#39;grand plie&#39;.
Inés Sastre didn&#39;t stop for the walk around the premises of the building, but she had shown us the photos of her son on her cell phone first.
The following day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez - another big boy who travels by motorbike - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously made sure, that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there there, c&#39;est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And as if that weren&#39;t enough, they&#39;re all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine yourself caught up in the frenetic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However there are not one or even two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the struggle to disengage from the world of work.
No, this number amounts to no more and no less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, the classic massage or &quot;spa&quot; treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole &quot;menu&quot; of options tailored to everyone&#39;s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled &quot;1001 ways to relax&quot; and its calm will reach bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this &quot;manual&quot; disproves that belief.
Furthermore, he suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline isn&#39;t already flowing through your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it&#39;s time to sit on the sofa, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Sleep talking
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk while remaining asleep.
The first time it happens, at best you get a scare, but it really doesn&#39;t matter much.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somniloquy.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have been told that you talked in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or more regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes connected to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (wetting the bed), or sleepwalking, but this is not necessarily the case.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stressful or overexcited situations.
In any case, it is still a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks in a very calm tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite occurs (screams, shouts, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an anomalous state of anxiety as an outlet for the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or a stressful situation).
What can be done, however, is to take into consideration a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to overexcite the baby before he goes to sleep.
Offer calm games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children who find it difficult to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the baby to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleep talkers appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that happened.
Useful tips
Don&#39;t wake him up.
It&#39;s useless, because he&#39;s not aware of what&#39;s happening, and you&#39;ll interrupt his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if he appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check where such great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he&#39;s saying (which isn&#39;t the most common situation), don&#39;t be tempted to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thinking.
Additionally, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming to say it, so you need to be very careful in interpreting the information and the conclusions it might lead to.
Never tell the child that you could ask him questions during the night to learn his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
Such a thing causes enormous distress.
In short, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing serious, it&#39;s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found their way back to victory at home after a long unsuccessful spell.
Without playing a formidable match, the Yellow-Blacks created the most scoring chances turning one into the match win.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the forwards struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting team captain Kauffmann who came close to scoring seven with a long shot, Illhaeusern began to gain the upper hand and one after the other they provoked the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then tall Hirn, Romain flagship and still Diebold.
Dannemarie responded with a block in midfield, leaving only the unleashed Riahi in attack.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with two initial chances signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais&#39;s first goal for Illhaeusern, well positioned, he recovered a ball cleared from a first attempt by Diebold (53&#39;) .
But the Illhaeusern scorer could not savor his happiness for long and was sent off a dozen minutes later thus leaving his team-mates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie won&#39;t be able to take advantage of it and won&#39;t pose major problems for the Illhaeusern eleven, who retreated just to &quot;strengthen&quot; the defence, except in the very last minutes of the game when, after a daring action, the ball grazed the crossbar.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère department, on Tuesday morning to charm its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him &quot;with a constructive spirit&quot; and hope that &quot;he will present himself with concrete proposals&quot;.
A presidential visit that takes place precisely at the same time as the general assembly of the &quot;crisis committee&quot;, created by Breton fishermen in order to adopt measures to deal with the soaring price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average equal to more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president &quot;will discuss with them about possible solutions to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to make the working conditions and salaries of sailors safe&quot;.
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy at a standstill.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted &quot;snail operations&quot; in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections with Belle-île were not interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, sailors already demonstrated their determination by burning tires and paddles in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient from dawn onwards, while demonstrations took hold in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended towards the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d&#39;Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the docks, or in Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, broke the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they have decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; will in fact decide on Tuesday the movement&#39;s future actions and possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by leaders of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; since &quot;the fishermen will not give in&quot; and &quot;they have no intention of moving to Paris&quot;, announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the performance limit of a boat is only reached with diesel fuel below 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; died of cancer, aged 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes said goodbye to film legend and actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts for 2008
The aircraft manufacturer counts 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world&#39;s fourth largest in the sector, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company largely relies on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would divest more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, revived by the US monetary authorities, would sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the loan of 85 billion dollars, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider the sale of a large part of its assets, as well as the sale of the life insurance business to the international market and to the United States, the newspaper specifies on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG board met Sunday evening to consider any divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation has been obtained from AIG.
Assets that AIG plans to divest include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 percent stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT added.
No final decision has been made regarding these divestments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the American authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: Morning Meeting chronicle
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives ruled against the Paulson plan to bail out financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or an unprecedented decline, approaching to 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day the stock exchanges reopened following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of leading technology stocks, lost 199.61 points to close at 1,983.73 and the broader Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to close at 1,106, 55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the start of the session, Wall Street sank following the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Trésor Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
&quot;It is a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,&quot; said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
&quot;All of this signals how much the market was counting on the project,&quot; he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be &quot;too late&quot; to adopt one.
&quot;If the project were effectively moribund (…) then the baton would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the American central bank, ed) and to the other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions&quot;, warned Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And further highlighting the state of emergency, &quot;each passing day leads to the collapse of a financial institution&quot; in the United States, Piegza underlined.
After Washington Mutual went bankrupt on Friday, authorities staged a purchase of Wachovia&#39;s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention in favor of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets &quot;are not just facing an American crisis, but a crisis worldwide,” added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has soared.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bills fell to 3.632%, versus 3.827% on Friday evening, while the 30-year yield fell to 4.161%, versus 4.357% the previous day.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced it has signed an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan&#39;s largest bank, to invest $9 billion in a 21 percent stake in the company, following a sharp drop in its shares on the stock exchange.
A week after drafting a tentative deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley&#39;s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or three billion dollars.
The stipulated price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of August 31st.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, delivering a 10% yield.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average price of 29 dollars per security, or a percentage lower than its current price of 28%.
However, at around 17.00 Morgan Stanley shares fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars.
&quot;This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley into a bank holding company&quot;, explained John Mack, general manager of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its shares while bringing them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious stance than they previously assumed.
The modalities defined on Monday also show that in recent days the agreement has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum equal to 8.5 billion dollars.
&quot;A week ago in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: &quot;We thought our stake would be made up exclusively of common stock.
But considering the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves.&quot;
On a weighted average price basis, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their book value by 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis&quot;.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are exchanged for more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG would allow it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide details about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley is therefore expected to establish a Tier One solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan specified that it had &quot;significantly&quot; lightened its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have put a strain on the group, which has seen the value of its shares halve while the cost of risk insurance has skyrocketed.
Cost that ebbed on Monday, however remaining at a high level, around 12%.
Last week Goldman Sachs, the only other &quot;surviving&quot; among Wall Street&#39;s big investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, de Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, see you on Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism proper to the 21st century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the project for a new constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to the official results, 64% of voters voted &quot;yes&quot; in the referendum, on an 80% vote base.
According to these results, 28% voted &quot;no&quot;, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank.
For the draft constitution to be adopted, it would have to get half the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the polling stations and an estimate by a non-governmental organization announced a landslide victory for the &quot;yes&quot;, placing it between 63% and 70%.
On the other hand, Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution during the night between Sunday and Monday.
The &quot;Constitution has triumphed gloriously,&quot; he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The ballot, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points designed to consolidate the &quot;new socialism&quot; defended by the president.
This draft constitution consecrates the state&#39;s power over the economy, reserving it the &quot;development planning&quot; of a country that essentially lives off the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, and will have the possibility of dissolving the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-propose his candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also affirms free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also bans the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American counter-narcotics operations.
Obama ahead in the first televised duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House, here&#39;s a second one to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their respective victory in the televised duel, followed by a third of American households.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain&#39;s performance, while worthy, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll released Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has had the upper hand.
A snap poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them believe Obama the winner, while 25% bet on McCain.
An excellent performance by his list mate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm Obama&#39;s lead on Thursday.
&quot;Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has good intuition,&quot; however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in matters of foreign policy, emphasizing his opponent&#39;s &quot;naivety&quot; regarding the topics addressed during the first face-to-face meeting.
&quot;Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that..&quot; he has often stated over and over again.
&quot;I don&#39;t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills necessary to become president,&quot; he assured.
What has been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, underlined how his election would represent a new future.
Without going into length, it proved to be concise and precise.
It promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and intent to restore the United States&#39; image on the world stage.
&quot;McCain has never understood, unlike Obama,&quot; retorted a Democratic commercial this weekend, reproaching the Republican for not having taken the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in pouring rain, for an election meeting.
He didn&#39;t even utter the words &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;working class&quot;. The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the best person to save the economy from the precipice.
&quot;Next week could be a turning point,&quot; the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer considered yesterday.
Democrat Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama&#39;s economic insight to that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse &quot;is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain&quot;.
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the tremors of Wall Street, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear plants by 2030.
Cautiously, the two candidates dodged questions centered on the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euro) financial bailout adopted by Congress last night and hugely unpopular.
In Minsk, &quot;did you notice that there were elections?&quot;
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the polling stations closed in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: &quot;the dictator, resign&quot;.
Some confess that they didn&#39;t even vote: &quot;What&#39;s the point? They&#39;ll do what they want with my vote anyway,&quot; says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime which made a good impression on foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans on 40 Belarusian officials and an asset freeze, could be lifted if these elections are deemed legitimate by observers.
They have not been, according to the opposition.
&quot;We were removed from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes,&quot; complained Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of 12 parties.
&quot; It&#39;s a change of facade, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and leader of the pro-European movement, since the important thing is who counts the ballots and in this case it is the executive.
If opposition deputies enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, not elected.
But their entry into parliament may involve television space, regional meetings and bills.&quot;
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter the political game since &quot;we need to start a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not undertake any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.&quot;
The opposition fears that the organization for security and cooperation in Europe which followed the electoral process will recognize the validity of the ballot.
He points out that the participation quotas seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given way to all kinds of manipulations.
&quot;Did you notice that there were elections? Asks the Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will have been at most five opposition deputies in parliament, the ones most convenient in power.&quot;
Night silence falls on the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased with their success.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions kidnapped ten days ago.
I&#39;m in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive in the desert for ten days were returned safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated in Chad by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently fit, the hostages arrived at the military base of Almaza, near the international airport of Cairo, at around 3.30 pm, aboard a special plane.
Aboard a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any press interviews, to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo tests.
They are in &quot;good health&quot; and no ransom has been paid &quot;to the kidnappers,&quot; Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Kidnapped on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the agency organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security chief said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
&quot;There were shots, half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled,&quot; said the manager who requested anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the &quot;lightning&quot; unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
From Belgrade, Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini underlined the importance of the role of secret agents and the Italian special forces.
We have to admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, of the special forces,&quot; he said, without adding any other details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army on patrol said it had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle carrying the kidnappers and killed six of them, including the Chadian leader of the kidnappers, and captured two.
According to the army, the kidnappers are linked to an organization of Darfur rebels, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The silent majority of culture
On the front page, a debate on the financing of culture on which the current electoral campaign is focused.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the paltry sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that cause hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don&#39;t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is paying three and a half million euros for the restoration of the Château de Chinon alone, in the Loire valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that affirms that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this in agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the protection of historical, genealogical, archives and patrimonial heritage, preserve, with little money, private archives and archaeological sites .
It is precisely they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of desperation when real estate developers and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The Encounter - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec yesterday celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest blood suppliers and effective in the world.
And above all, he regained the trust of the public, seriously shaken by the scandal of the infected blood in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus in the 1980s.
Faced with such a tragedy and protests by the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent a similar disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was slow to issue a report, some provinces set up a committee to devise a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, just 38% of people said they still had faith in the donation system in Québec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood sampling and field research over the ensuing years, we have regained the public&#39;s trust,” she explains before proudly stating that as of early 2008, approximately 94% of the population of Québec he now had faith in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that &quot;trust is something extremely fragile&quot;.
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, the Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has been its president since 1998, the year it was founded.
&quot;And we absolutely didn&#39;t know if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
We therefore based ourselves on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when there are doubts and a serious illness could result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that leads inevitably at death, measures of exclusion are adopted.
In April 1999, blood was refused from those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
Now, for some years now, it has been demonstrated that this disease is undoubtedly transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has thus shown us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.&quot;
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid test (TAN) which allows the presence of the virus to be recognized directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against it. on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have made it possible to reduce the window period, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to the moment in which the first viruses can be identified in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have made it possible to considerably decrease the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with the HIV virus.
&quot;In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before anyone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted by transfusion is found.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health, says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
&quot;Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogen will emerge in your system.
As recently as a year ago, Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant&quot;, continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also ensure that they provide enough.
&quot;Needs increase as the population ages.
As the most aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average constitutes only 3% of Québec inhabitants acceptable as donors.&quot;
However, all healthy people over the age of 18 who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be refused for a period of one year .
&quot;With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortages are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor group as they get older and can no longer donate.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic nowadays that there is hardly an hour to donate blood,&quot; says Francine Décary desolately.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which operates the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is an abundance of blood rich in stem cells which can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
&quot;We celebrated the bank placement of our 1,000th cord blood sample a few weeks ago and expect to collect more than 1,000 each year.
We should start offering them for transplantation early next year,&quot; says Dr. Décary who describes this practice of cord blood sampling as very popular.
&quot;Many mothers are disappointed not to have access to it&quot;, as Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Football - The Impact in the semifinals
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semifinals of the Serie A eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, during a decisive second match of the quarterfinals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute.
After a goalless first half by either side, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to guard Matt Jordan.
Recall that in the first game of the return leg, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburbs.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
In Minnesota on Saturday night, the Thundler closed an early 3-1 run in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still make the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, with further details to be confirmed later in the day.
In short - Kovalev&#39;s decisive goal
The Canadien and its aces are ready to restart the season.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for the win, in the fourth of Hab&#39;s preparatory games.
The only goal signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.&quot;
&quot;He tried to overdo it in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the match.
There was a standing ovation.&quot;
Charest points to the North
The prime minister does not rule out holding elections before the end of the year.
After the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, in Québec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (on the left), is trying to be elected in today&#39;s partial elections.
&quot;Expanding the borders of our last great northern frontier&quot;: this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, a sort of &quot;image mill&quot; is projected.
Spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mineral crops, images of Quebec seen with &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc. were mixed up on three big screens.
Big means like in the middle of the electoral campaign.
Moreover, during the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The &quot;North Plan&quot; is the fourth point of a &quot;project&quot; that the prime minister says he has for Quebec, that of a &quot;new economic space&quot;, which includes a first agreement with France on manpower, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister&#39;s most recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never before been the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister limited himself to explaining why the North would be &quot;a jewel with immense potential&quot;, but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, just as he did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects .
At most, he limited himself to pointing out what in his opinion deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures has experienced various improvements .
According to Charest&#39;s list, the North contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.&quot;
That &quot;territory twice the size of France,&quot; is here, it&#39;s Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us&quot;, he insisted, as if to solicit a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he underlined : Gold Rush in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
&quot;It&#39;s up to us, it&#39;s our future&quot;, he added, after a dramatic pause to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister specified during the press conference.
&quot;It is a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a long time and when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government,&quot; he indicated.
After all, &quot;considering climate change, we need to reevaluate the North&quot;, he declared speaking of the North-West Passage, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.&quot;
What about the locals, First Nations and Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive in this regard and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two ex-ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-deputy of the PQ d&#39;Ungava), have already started the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a major meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, but a moment in which &quot;common visions will be provided&quot;
Moreover, the development of the North would comply with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be &quot;concerted, orderly and will respect the environment&quot;, he promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;project&quot; as a continuum with that of the Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
&quot;Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves by transforming challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.&quot;
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail party in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage&#39;s arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes renaming the Centrale Beauharnois into the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
&quot;From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always known how to shape the future,&quot; said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Charest specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
&quot;All this remains between us, but I feel that we will make it&quot;, he confessed to his militants, arousing heartfelt applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of launching a poll in the autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very busy, especially in a federal council mission to China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend&#39;s General Council provided the Liberal frontrunner with a platform for nationalist resolutions, especially &quot;constitutional aspirations&quot; that passed like oil: the PLQ above all calls for the recognition of &quot;Quebec&#39;s specificity&quot; in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will nominate members of Canada&#39;s Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they will have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the draft of the Northern Plan has been met with skepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, dusted off the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have complied with its application.
If he had done so,&quot; we would have progressed today&quot; commented Marois alongside the candidate of the Jean-Talon (election took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated that it supports the government&#39;s adoption of the Northern Plan.
&quot;What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a show&quot;, commented the leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont&#39;s replacement, who just returned from vacation today.
Letters - A country dishonored
It was Vic Toews, former &quot;Justice&quot; minister (ironically) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare last summer that Louise Arbor was a &quot;shame&quot; to Canada.
Disgracing in this way a woman who fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves our full admiration says a lot about both the prime minister&#39;s entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government which is the only one of all the Western countries involved in not having repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time the events accused of him took place.
The only government which, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a travesty of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, by way of information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely that same government that closes its eyes to torture: it matters very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of abuse.
We don&#39;t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and &quot;democracy&quot;, a word that Harper never ceases to flaunt and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we have arrived at the moment in which there is no longer any morality: a Canadian citizen can be ill-treated, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned according to the discretion of a until now minority head of government (to see what will happen after October 14th…).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Herein lies the shame, Mr. Toews, in the renunciation of all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold&#39;s Orwellian Speech
In its Sept. 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, managing vice president of Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the largest gold company in the world has filed a six million libel suit against three authors and a small penniless publishing house with the intention of starting a &quot;transparent public debate&quot;.
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a libel suit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this major difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to take a position contrary to its.
No matter the outcome of the trial, the writers and the publisher of the book Black Canada will have to spend a large sum of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers financed from the pockets practically without mining company fund.
After all, in these unequal battles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that gags the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to pronounce themselves again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it would have had to present its view of the facts before the public.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates usually take place with the exchange of views and not with a truncheon.
It would therefore have been sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could have shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn&#39;t seem to have too much faith in public opinion and rudely rejects the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a &quot;public&quot; debate when his contempt for that same audience is so evident?
In the vice-president&#39;s world, it seems that this word refers exclusively to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn&#39;t understand – or doesn&#39;t want to understand – is that the public who support the authors and editors of Black Canada do so primarily because they reject the mining company&#39;s brutal means.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the light of what many perceive as a sort of gag (researching the &quot;public debate&quot;, Barrick Gold has just given to the authors of Black Canada an ultimatum ordering them to stop using that word…)
Beyond Garver&#39;s surreal speech, the lawsuit filed by Barrack Gold constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are inconvenient for the richest companies in the world, on pain of multiple lawsuits, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific norms as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we belong, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek transparent debate at all.
This is to the detriment of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to adopt measures capable of limiting abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic camps, yesterday finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollar plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been weighing on Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the repayment of public money, new provisions to limit the number of houses foreclosed for non-payments, as well as a right to inspect wages paid to managers of protected companies.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a marathon of negotiations that lasted two days.
&quot;We have made great progress toward an effective market deal,&quot; said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
&quot;Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the crisis currently underway on Wall Street.&quot;, explained the Democrat.
&quot;It is the crucial point: if we had not acted in this way, priceless heartache and turmoil would have poured into the daily lives of Americans,&quot; said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns regarding the impact of a new bankruptcy on investors.
The time limit agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Joining the negotiation later, the two candidates for the American presidential elections showed themselves rather in favor of the agreement, without however avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves credit for having added some provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to maintain their domicile and the one relating to the salaries for executives of companies covered by the State.
&quot;When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to be happy about.
But these measures are necessary,&quot; he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: &quot;I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so.&quot;
&quot;According to what I&#39;ve read, it&#39;s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward&quot;
The option of no intervention is simply unacceptable,&quot; he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to buy back the doubtful loans, risky and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions with taxpayers&#39; money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a real estate bubble which first of all led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (mortgages), to then extend to other more widespread forms of credit instruments (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of the liquidity and disarray of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of incumbent Republicans who scuppered the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that impasse since the Democrats have accepted that the &quot;toxic&quot; assets of some troubled companies are only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to accommodate everyone, a provision was added in Congress that if the government were to face losses over the next five years from such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to keep your balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote in Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in protected companies that will be worth dividends in the event of a profit and which he can sell when the dust settles.
Under the plan, the federal government will have the ability to delay foreclosure proceedings on home loans and to set limits on the salary and severance pay paid to executives of the affected firms.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives, and to a vote in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
&quot;Evidently, Washington doesn&#39;t hear you,&quot; Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents.
&quot;Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But certainly not take advantage of the taxpayers..
Leading a small group in Congress dubbed the &quot;skeptics&#39; caucus,&quot; Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to say: we ask Congress not to jump to hasty conclusions and carefully examine the way forward,&quot; he declared yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when French bank BNS Paribas said it would pull out of buying its bankrupt competitor after losing 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for the risky home loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of Europe&#39;s twenty largest banks and ten largest insurers.
&quot;It&#39;s not money lost,&quot; Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and the right to vote in banking matters are levied.
It&#39;s certainly something savers and families appreciate now that times are shaky.&quot;
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government appears to be on its way to nationalizing another bank teetering on the edge of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the loans currently outstanding at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the British bank&#39;s branches and customer accounts.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
The blue-eyed beauty was for a long time his trump card, for others his weak point.
Had the American actor with the bewitching smile freed himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have expelled him from that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
But what constancy!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the glories.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but he too spokesperson for freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples magical children are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, ultimate seal of quality.
Since a whole country was recognized in him in love with the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, proud in combat, who in the early 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, subsequently attended the Actors Studio in New York, before triumph in the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
That same civil rights activist was also the racing driver who finished second at the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as a sex symbol, albeit part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The gray areas of a reserved, discreet, committed star, allergic to show-business scandals, leave with him, the mystery of which will never be completely revealed.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
The passing of Paul Newman was heartbreaking for cinephiles this weekend, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through his interpretations.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy incapable of desiring a fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958 are confused in memory.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not deliver on its promises.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Someone Up There Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and reprized after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice criminal in the excellent Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiard player in Lo Spaccone, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which in 1987 earned him the only Oscar out of 9 nominations.
That face through the years was hers.
Him again.
Epochs follow one another along its path.
Young people know him above all for the cult movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, by the Coen brothers.
The circle had come full circle with one last role as godfather of the Irish mob in Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike the bigger film legends who soon left the craft, Newman would hang out in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its glitz, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cinematographer, defined it, with a touch of irony, &quot;a living challenge to underplaying&quot;, judging its performances exaggerated.
The profession hasn&#39;t always been a game for handsome Paul Newman, to whom roles seemed to fall like godsend.
However, he often preferred the role of the outcast to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, scoundrels or desperate alcoholics, of which he expressed disarray and rebellion with his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown shades of his real demure sensibility.
Jennifer&#39;s First Time, 1968 (based on Canadian Margaret Laurence&#39;s novel), starring his wife Joanne Woodward in the title role, painted a subtle feminine portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated the film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes showered on Newman yesterday, his great friend and old comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had acted together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness &quot;His presence has made my life and this country better&quot; .
Generosity and love of life, two great characteristics of the late actor.
Beyond a legendary career, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of the Hollywood drift, dies.
We will have seen his face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging it as a choice in bad taste, even if it was born as a gag.
The proceeds from those sales were, however, going to his Foundation for Troubled Children.
Newman, instead of resting on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter saying &quot;Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his lucky stars.&quot;
It was a privilege to be there.&quot;
And it was an equal privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Model citizen, therefore, and much more.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
Soon, on October 8, the hearing of the criminal case against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed as part of a criminal association that caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor&#39;s Office, the money obtained from calls for tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified that the activities were carried out through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totaling 65 million guilders, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, disclosed by the investigating authorities, they withdrew the money obtained from calls for tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent operations and the associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To make them, the invoice blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, was established among other things during the trip to the hills above Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter&#39;s confession, he had to choose boarding houses and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for drinks, and invoices were then prepared based on these to be forwarded to the calls for tenders, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri who, according to our information, mainly drafted the reports needed to obtain funding.
One of the choices of the &quot;study trip&quot; of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant place provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the restaurateur, so many people would not enter the restaurant all together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later called Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, is full of formal and content errors.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, yet the invoice included 130 guests.
But the imaginative invoice compilers exaggerated when they reported Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, whose accounts - according to information released to the judicial authorities - did not even include documents in the name of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá .
Győző Farkas, director of the company, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor&#39;s office and they showed him the invoices, he immediately understood that they were fake documents.
&quot;On the stamp, the name and VAT number of our company were in the wrong place.&quot;
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice, one hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds, did not add up.
In addition, the invoice was for catering and their restaurant has not been in operation for some time.
The assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash payment trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing company invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included on the invoice, while travel to countries outside the European Union is VAT exempt.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also incorrect on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favor of the Jobb Jövőért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company VAT must be applied at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the fabricated invoice was written by hand.
In addition to this, the &quot;issuers&quot; have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated the transport of goods by road as the activity carried out, as we learn from the Prosecutor&#39;s proceeding, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for consultancy of investments.
Furthermore, due to formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favor of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The forgers also paid no attention to the fact that HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület lunched there, precisely for this reason the company&#39;s liquidator, according to our information, denied that he issued that invoice.
They billed knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták in favor of the Együtt foundation to Harmadik Évezredért of almost 4 million guilders.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft, currently in liquidation, also collaborated with Zuschlag and partners, which in 2003 supplied issued invoices worth around 5 million guilders to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even movement of money because the invoices prepared were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
The following group of invoicing companies includes those who can be connected with the defendants.
e.g. Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the address of the general manager of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which is involved in the trading of fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of IT equipment, for a value of approximately 18 million guilders.
According to the investigation data, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, under liquidation since 14 September 2005, bought these invoices.
The general director of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov allegedly forwarded documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he had issued invoices in the name of the company to the firms Atlasz, Hoppá and in Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and the equivalent value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, however, none of the companies was operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
However, the companies came in handy because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, drafter of the company&#39;s founding documents, invoices were issued in the name of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices to the various entities for a total value of 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor&#39;s office believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, fabricated for the Biztos Pont tender notice.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a tender for the Socialist Party&#39;s public utility body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 guilders each but the sums were not used for the purposes stated in the announcement.
In order for this not to come to light, they presented the TMA with five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei&#39;s office in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the prosecutor&#39;s office, will probably report on the progress of the production of the invoices.
However the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, would decide to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It remains to be seen whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the socialists have reached agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million guilders, a large part of the damage - would be willing to be the scapegoat.
For now, Zuschlag could have also taken offense given that his requests to lighten his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrest, have so far not been granted.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater damages can freely walk around or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which he is not allowed.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why Spend More Money?
At auctions buyers are inclined to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have managed to discover the neuro-economic basis of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men don&#39;t want to fall behind in a competition such as the eBay auction, so they are willing to pay a higher price.
Research has sought to trace the nervous pattern of this &quot;match&quot; at the level of the nervous system using experimental rods.
One group of volunteers played the lotto, the other group of players participated in an auction while they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, in which the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striatum under the cerebral cortex comes into intensive function when one loses the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the &quot;self-gratification&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by the avoidance of the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To back up their theory, the research team economists conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told what the real value of the product in question was and they placed their bets.
In addition to this, another group has promised that if they win, they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but group members would lose their money if they lost at the auction.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them the gain was underlined, while for the other the loss.
Proving the neurologists&#39; hypothesis, members of the group playing &quot;against the loss&quot; were willing to make higher bets than the control or &quot;winning&quot; group.
&quot;These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, up to now these explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation&quot; - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is cited as the leading cause of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition hepatitis is the collective name for contagious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the alimentary canal (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming infected food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
Then yellowish spots form on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the stools become light and the urine dark, healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most severe form of the disease, which causes liver tumors and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason is, according to estimates, only one in ten people receive drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated it can cause cirrhosis of the liver and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because the pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So prevention and regular medical tests are very important.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed people.
In the world today the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worthwhile to consult the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus the infective power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by patient organizations worldwide.
The purpose is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
The Benelux governments nationalize part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux states help through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the crisis in the American credit market: the three nations will provide 11.2 billion euros to the financial institution - insurance with interest also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands reached an agreement at the highest level over the weekend, also involving the president of the European Central Bank and the European commissioner for competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties that the international financial market has been experiencing for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard may set a precedent.
Under the decision taken Sunday night, all three states will own nearly half (49%) of the bank&#39;s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the shares of Fortis had started with a vertical collapse, serious signs of crisis of the institution were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow it to fail.
Shares of the bank fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering current share prices, the entire capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank&#39;s executives this value is not real.
The top management attributes the collapse of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the 700 billion dollar American plan.
The stock slowly started to climb again on Monday.
Filip Dierckx was named the bank&#39;s new CEO on Friday.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government has previously assured investors that they need not fear losing their money.
Panic did not spread among the bank&#39;s customers, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experiment examining how belief in god affects the sensation of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electroshocked, while all of them looked at a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to fend off much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of researches in which not only academics but also scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University are taking part.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes electroshock was connected to the left hand of the experiment subject.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the review hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo&#39;s painting was chosen because it didn&#39;t differ too much from the other and they considered it to have a reassuring effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that seeing the Virgin Mary made them feel &quot;safe&quot;, as if &quot;someone was taking care&quot; of them and &quot;they were soothed and filled with peace&quot;.
Looking at the religious-themed image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo&#39;s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but one must find the right image.
“We need to look for an image towards which they have very positive feelings, like a mother or father,” said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the result of the research.
&quot;The practice of faith is supposed to change, and in many cases it does change our personalities.&quot; - added Wright.
After the excellent results the only question remains if a painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could that have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its 10th birthday, Google can claim to be as much in people&#39;s pockets as it is in the sky above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, which clinic they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company&#39;s directors, this is still not enough.
Instead, what concerns the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they don&#39;t really see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that the main purpose of Google is to collect as much personal data of its users and this is necessary to comply with the original goal of the founders of Google which was: &quot;we put all the information of the world!&quot;.
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: he would like it if Google could answer questions like &quot;what am I doing tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;what would be the right job for me?&quot; but software can&#39;t answer seemingly simple questions because they don&#39;t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that exactly the searched words are recorded during their internet searches, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users eg. they can store their browsing history, they can look back at what they searched for and clicked on, which will generate much better tailored results in the long run; Recommendations are based on this same logic with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and recorded preferences.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - wonder users concerned about Google&#39;s data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of internet users are caused by the fear felt by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power .
However, one fact is confirmed and that is that all the searched expressions are not only recorded but in justified cases they can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded information to the Brazilian government that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Google-maintained Orkut community page .
However, Internet users concerned about personal rights sighed with relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later it cannot force Google under no statute of incorporation to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully snatched nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search phrases obtained in connection with the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to obtain search lists of individual users and the &#39;entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google&#39;s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid to provide their personal data lash out at Google because they believe that in this way their intimate sphere and private life is affected by starting to use its services and they rise up with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and the proliferation of computer enthusiasts, activists and users who have appeared in many countries see them as the future generation of big companies, the &quot;cool corporation&quot;, as opposed to their rival, Microsoft, dismissed as the conqueror of the world. because of Windows, even though they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which precisely implies one of the most often repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks of nothing but collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the dimension of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing ourselves.
An average young person can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, they can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm which lists their musical tastes, all of these can be entered into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm , he can also write blogs on which his most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common circle of friends, easily learns who her perfidious boyfriend spent the night with or a company can fire one of its employees because he wrote an honest opinion on the top management: one thing is sure, the concept of private life has now completely reconsidered.
Those who live a life online manage to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do it (starting for example with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time voluntarily leaving no traces).
Not a few people who purposely don&#39;t register on community pages to avoid being found, Google&#39;s online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and which do not make up our best profile to date.
Public opinion is not even waiting in secret for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently the company with its $156 billion value is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time instead cause great discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers find some alarming points alongside all of this: for example, the top management of the company completely rejected the protests of the employees after doubling the company kindergarten fee, considered the repeated daily catering of the employees to be too expensive, all of this however, it discounts the fact that in 2006 Google bowed its head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter out all results that offend good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is sure, however, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world in one point: while some believe that the scanning and archiving of Google books and magazines will assume such proportions that the company will soon find itself in front of the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create our own health profile with our reports, doctors and problems .
The fact that Google is building a genetic database may offer good material for the next generation of science fiction writers, the famous Cory Doctorow&#39;s story Scroogled describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in alarming way.
Two minors helped Ózd&#39;s double murderer clear his tracks
The police questioned two minors about the double homicide of Ózd, who are well-founded suspects of helping to clear up the traces of the crime, the spokesman of the Borsod Region Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime charged against them, they are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors, two girls according to information from the MTI, defend themselves on the loose.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in Ózd&#39;s double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated multiple homicide committed for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he tricked his creditor to a construction site in Ózd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information, the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros, approximately 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange&#39;s list of shares.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
Czech financial newspaper E15 says the Poles&#39; offer represents the highest figure so far put forward for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all those concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders&#39; agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with an almost 25% stake, followed by Bank Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis are already speaking of &quot;a second 9/11&quot;.
The global financial disaster occurred thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who was unable to unite his own party behind a hastily botched law, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superfinancier Warren Buffett put it, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 9/11.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing more and more, and the whole world will suffer from this in the future.
Bush&#39;s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of crisis management.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva hints.
Some states today can still offer a lifeline to reeling financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and concentrate control on the dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday weakened financial institutions obtained more than 100 billion euros - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which the anxieties that European taxpayers, similar to American ones, will have to put their hands on their wallets to remedy the crisis seem increasingly real .
Until now, the EU hasn&#39;t worried much about the crisis that has swept the old continent like a tsunami.
The &quot;saviors&quot; shouldn&#39;t immediately wave the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers&#39; money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What could be a better way to develop collision avoidance technologies than to mimic obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example those of bees.
In the astonishing project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the hornets gave Nissan engineers an initial strategic cue on how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-car with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of avoiding all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really looks a lot like our protective shield - explained Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technologies and research and development at the exhibition.
Important is the role of the bee&#39;s eyesight, capable of a view of 300 degrees in any direction.
Engineers drew on the telemetry laser idea to copy the bee&#39;s vision function.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor which immediately transforms it into a command to avoid a collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels by the amount necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, differently from the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive way.
&quot;If this were not the case, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions&quot; - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and of the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damageable and innermost layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must mirror what one bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees the deflection cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steerability of the wheels.
In this way instead of the infinite possibilities available to the bees to avoid the other bees, the robot, as available possibility, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by Li-Polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they last longer than Li-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the instantaneousness of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot has to process some input in seconds and react.
There is no need to memorize them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, thus using only a few tens of Kb of memory.
No need for gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step in the development of instantaneous collision avoidance technology which Nissan expects to be installed in production vehicles within 10 years.
A further application possibility can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which leads to the destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They also found the baby&#39;s name very expensive
The written version of the 700 billion dollar economic bailout law for the purchase of disproportionate credits has been drafted, to be implemented in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new deals that lasted until midnight Saturday Eastern time, congressional leaders agreed on the $700 billion bailout after days of debate, Reuters reported.
We have taken serious steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives according to whom it only remained to put the agreement on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan compromise.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson speaking of the outcome of the compromise said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of bailing out Wall Street but of reversing the economic trend.
The written version of the plan was made public before the Asian markets opened at 8 am Washington time (2 am Monday Central European Time), but did not lead to much stock market growth .
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the project called the 2008 economic stabilization law regarding the program, after which it will be the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi Saturday night, then welcomed news of the deal at the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
However, the program differs from the Bush administration&#39;s original proposal, which stipulated that the $700 billion would all be spent on the purchase of bonds with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step it will be possible to spend a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday in Congress, with which the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind them, like the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special panel will monitor the program in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
Spending the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can buy credit, mortgages and securities at the same time with mortgages and other types of &quot;poisoned&quot; credit.
The purchase can take place through auctions and in a direct way - the ministry officials announced.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay a price adequate to the probable damages.
Henrz Paulson said: the law provides the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law that has just been signed - he added.
The directors of banks in crisis and awaiting state aid think instead that the government will limit their severance pay, defined by overseas slang simply as a golden parachute.
Limitations on payments will only happen in some cases, and the limitations also depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys at an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the golden parachute, if they don&#39;t retire the lapsed bank manager.
When directly buying disproportionate credits, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that directors&#39; money is not exaggerated.
In addition, the existing Golden Parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to incentivize participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of general administrators - commented the provision the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, decreasing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also win if the economy, and with it the bailed out bank, get back on their feet .
The bill includes that over the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal that stipulates how to repay projected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Naturally on both sides there have been those who have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us, not to defend taxpayer dollars - said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat Mary Kaptur believes the steps were taken by the same people responsible for the Wall Street crash.

Next year in the US without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the American-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago with Hungarian representatives there.
In his opinion &quot;now everything depends on whether the electronic entry and control system is built overseas in time&quot;.
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be entry permits, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will present the medal of the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and will hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also come out in favor of the bank bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support on Sunday for the government&#39;s plan of 700 billion dollars to bail out the banks, however there are some politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after marathon negotiations that lasted for days, announced on Sunday night that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bailout plan for the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to unwind the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves better suited than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has once again regained some advantage, while McCain&#39;s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president, has been dispersed.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that Congress will quickly approve the $700 billion plan.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection passages that were also supported by him.
&quot;Now we have to act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your job, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability&quot; - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000.
He did not let himself escape the definition of McCain&#39;s economic ideas as outdated.
McCain in an interview with ABC explained that &quot;we will all swallow this situation with difficulty (...) but doing nothing is not a viable path&quot;.
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a control committee of the finance minister and the limitation of the severance payments of top managers, things on which he was the one who insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a significant role in the agreements, instead he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday said the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
Press coverage of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole have the voters become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider&#39;s party is ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German left-wing magazine, in the article The revolution of Bavaria devours one&#39;s parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber took office.
The Christian Socialists have been modernizing Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merker.
The defeat did not come as a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that was feasible exactly ten years ago ended: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had plunged to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the time of the much mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this is the modernization carried out consistently in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists already predicted it 40 years ago, but time was very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are clear.
The right-wing pole is intact, only within the pole have voters become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have distanced themselves from the CSU: the freelancers, the artisans, the diplomats and university graduates.
Here support for the CSU fell below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper &quot;Who with whom?&quot; In the article &quot;Party chairmen are stuck in coalition issues&quot; he deals with the confused domestic political situation in Austria that has arisen following the elections.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ proves open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss a coalition.
The elections have been done, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television, the party leaders barely showed their cards.
SPÖ chairman Werner Faymann confirmed his willingness to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was rejected in any case.
Repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he stated, the cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still an open matter in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ reiterated that he is open in all directions.
&quot;To prevent the red-black coalition we are ready to take responsibility for governing&quot; - said Haider.
Járóka: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, began today in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz deputy of the European People&#39;s Party in the message addressed to the plenum as the main rapporteur of the congress drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and moreover the most serious obstacle for their statement.
Xavier Bertrand French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil and rights advocacy organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that the Roma are excluded from the labor market primarily due to their low level of education.
&quot;The majority of young Roma do not have a medium level education qualification and as a result of poor quality primary education only a negligible number of them can achieve a higher education qualification&quot;.
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in enforcing human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
According to the deputy, it is necessary to make these links aware in the broader sphere between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labor market increase; through taxes paid on income and consumption they contribute to the nation&#39;s budget.
&quot;The Roma&#39;s right to European citizenship must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools&quot; - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the deputy, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason the correct respect of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
&quot;The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe&quot; - asked Járóka.
In the spirit of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot; to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year, starting from the meeting in Berlin last year, is to ensure a single forum to further the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at state and European level.
The fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurers, based on people&#39;s drug purchase data, often refuse to take out an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear the market for data is spiraling out of control.
“There is a privacy program that the use of drug prescription data depends on the approval of the individual concerned in any case.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken coop to the fox&quot; - writes the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick, author of the program to follow the prescriptions of medicines.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the amount due in the event of accidents to the state of health of any customer and if they deem the risk too high, they do not stipulate the insurance.
Some time ago the customer had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was stipulated only after the outcome of the examination.
10 years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the customer&#39;s identification code, it is possible to easily obtain information from pharmacies on which medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half and from this the program deduces which diseases he suffers from and in which health condition is found.
e.g. If you regularly buy large quantities of cholesterol reducers this means that your blood fat level is practically incurably high and is placed in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not have much left over from the paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the cons is that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from an insurance-commercial point of view, is a factor of increased risk, the first two are not.
Separate companies have been formed for the request and processing of data and these, before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient&#39;s approval.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have so far not imposed fines for negligence.
Recently, some companies also process the results of laboratory tests and link them to medicine consumption data in order to provide a more precise picture of the patients&#39; state of health.
More and more companies have access to data and at the same time controlling usage will become increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity only extends to health services and insurance.
Before Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities the power to oversee companies specializing in data services.
Richard Dick admits that this is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links data forwarding with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned can not so much withhold approval because otherwise the insurers will not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the hens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
CSU: pity for a transitional period
The fate of the awkward couple Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, heads have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being at the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is how long the pity lasts.
The fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes will be decided by the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend in October.
In any case, the two much-criticized politicians have made it known that they are not being attacked with full force in the chair.
They thus attempted to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the grassroots who one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot; demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the peak of his career, the Christian Social Union obtained 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they have dropped to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was &quot;absolute monarch&quot; in Bavaria which gives 18% of the German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy still count, in the future they will be forced to unite anyway.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, obtained a place in the small exploratory group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Voters exponents of right for a possible government coalition in Munich.
By a strange twist of fate, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature in the list of Free Electors, whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity for a coup by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
The CSU executives are now concentrating all their forces on somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also get an active role, who until now has been plotting in the shadows. The former regional governor and former CSU chairman called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some galling statements towards the CSU, according to which they deserved more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU, which played a decisive role in the national victory of 2005, is not put back on its feet with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide her disappointment at the fiasco, the loss of ground by the CSU will not negatively affect the grand coalition in Berlin.
Which is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats is still going on.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposition: 110-0
Not a single opposition representative entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday&#39;s elections.
According to Russian observers it is the sign of well-being and stability ensured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) however it can be explained by the fraud committed in the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Even though the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday&#39;s elections the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional change in the 2006 elections held in controversial circumstances, &quot;granted&quot; some seats in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus renounced a previously evaluated boycott.
Behind the opposition&#39;s expectations was Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which applied for a credit to reduce imports of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians pipelines owned by Beltransgaz crossing the country, intended to improve relations with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter due to the Belarusian political situation considered undemocratic.
He referred to a détente that the OSCE, evaluating the electoral campaign, has placed the emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as eg. a ban on standing for a third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday&#39;s quick report from the OSCE also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates could practically not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is perceptible: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is even willing to have a small confrontation with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even if Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state on paper, has already considered the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - Aleksandr Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that he remain despite the fact that &quot;the authorities were afraid to let even a single opponent enter a weightless Parliament&quot;.
The opposition does not envisage protest actions for the results but rather tries to get the message to the voters of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that not even the The officially more assisted class, that of pensioners, considers Lukashenko&#39;s regime adequate, considering the creation of social security as its main result.
Due to the country&#39;s indebtedness and growing economic deficit, the disintegration of social security &quot;reminiscent of sepulchral silence&quot; - believes Milinkevich - is only a matter of time.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers judged the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: &quot;men believe not in words but in deeds&quot;, so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Global Marseillaise menu
European Union and India double trade
Given that the European Union and India are mostly mutual trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit meeting was also dominated by this issue, in addition to all other global issues.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit which will primarily deal with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India is becoming a great democratic power which should be given a greater voice in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet managed to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member in the Council of UN security.
So there was no emphasis on this question at the ninth summit organized yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as rotating president of the Union, José Manuel Barroso president of the commission and Javier Solana high representative for foreign affairs received the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found an agreement to double in 5 years , i.e. increase trade up to 100 billion euros.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious a goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so air traffic can also kick off in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India&#39;s largest trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU&#39;s partners.
The summit devoted attention to global affairs.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and they called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, even though both sides played a part in its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will continue with its energy and climate programme, ie it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be made at next year&#39;s climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the calling of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian prime minister will travel to the French capital today where in a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive an order worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with over 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honour.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact be institutionally present with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press at the Room Struktur in pavilion 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be an opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors on the total of Italian production is gradually decreasing, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Brunetta: &quot;From now on breakfast before work&quot;
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But starting today this new measure against the sly, against those who clock in and then go for a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-slacker novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Prime Minister, Mauro Masi.
&quot;Revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services&quot; specifies the minister.
&quot;Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening.
This is reformism&quot;, underlines Brunetta again.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi &quot;the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view&quot;.
There was no resistance from the employees, the general secretary assures: &quot;It was a process shared by the workers and everyone collaborated&quot;.
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Words from Brunetta, who suggests, smiling, &quot;a nice cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand&quot;.
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister then announced that &quot;in three months the absences due to illness of civil servants were reduced by 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people at work in a year&quot;.
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, &quot;whose salary dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rates&quot;.
Meanwhile, thousands of civil servants have joined together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by Codacons.
&quot;While the Minister of Public Administration today flaunts numbers about less absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumers&#39; association - the population of &#39;industrious slackers&#39; is constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands in Italy of correct and productive public administration employees who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate provisions contained in the decree&quot;.
In particular, the TAR will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for infirmity due to service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which the check-ups are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: &quot;Crucial prevention&quot;
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that there were around 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work in all the provinces of Italy, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
&quot;The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is&quot;, affirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Invalid of work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his &quot;deep appreciation for the association&#39;s constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and raising public awareness&quot;.
&quot;Naturally there was an indignant &#39;enough&#39;, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies which, due to their scale, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics&quot;.
Napolitano does not hide that &quot;there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Of particular significance are the numerous initiatives promoted in schools for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is necessary to keep attention to the phenomenon alive, not to give up on the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini underlined &quot;how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive commitment on all institutions aimed at putting an urgent end to it&quot;.
&quot;The data on accidents at work seem to signal a slight positive trend, but the fact remains that the number of white deaths is still impressive&quot;, remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
Indeed, we would not like this &quot;downtrend&quot; to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is slackened that tragedy strikes.
&quot;We believe that in general too little is still being done to combat the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - Mercandelli underlined - more controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this starting from the world of school&quot;.
&quot;A further effort is needed - he added - as regards communication and public awareness.
But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency&quot;.
Mercandelli then denounced &quot;the progressive deterioration of the levels of indemnity protection envisaged for work victims&quot; and the &quot;welfare drift towards which the system has been moving in recent years&quot;.
&quot;The objective therefore is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneity or donations from time to time provided by the legislator&quot;.
Mp3 players accused of endangering hearing
Listening to loud music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement released in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU&#39;s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (CSSERI), published today.
&quot;From this scientific opinion - reads the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than one hour a day keeping the device at high volumes risk permanent hearing loss&quot;.
&quot;I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high sound levels may unconsciously damage their hearing beyond repair,&quot; says Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;From the scientific findings - continues the EU manager - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific advice, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep pace with new technology.&quot;
Brussels had asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem, given the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they originate.
&quot;Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise coming from portable music devices and similar equipment&quot;.
Currently, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment, if they listen to music at high volumes (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week, exceed the limits currently in force relating to the maximum noise allowed in the workplace .
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent hearing loss after 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno kicks off the Commission for the future of the capital
Today we start, in March we close, in June we will draw conclusions.
This is the timetable set by the Campidoglio for the work of the &quot;Commission for the future of Rome Capital&quot;, which took office this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalize the guidelines for Rome.
Once its doors close in March, the Giunta and the City Council will evaluate analyzes and projects, so as to be able to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the &quot;official stamp&quot; of the Capitoline Hill and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
&quot;The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - Alemanno is keen to underline - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome whose political decision-makers, who remain the Giunta and the City Council, they can then be used.
There is no overlapping of roles but only the desire to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then he will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital&quot;.
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: &quot;Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of daily life and on the emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future&quot;.
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome is keen to point out that &quot;this Commission is neither a useless body nor a bandwagon: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and it will serve to reason and involve the best minds that the Capital expresses&quot;.
For Alemanno, in fact, &quot;we need to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level leap, which it absolutely needs, thinking about its future with a united spirit&quot;.
A future which, specifies the mayor of Rome &quot;will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries but will look far beyond&quot; not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital but &quot;also in consideration of the role that Rome can must perform as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean&quot;.
Obama? The first anti-American president. Here because
A well-known American politician who wants to pass as an independent wrote: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and had relations (as he still does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam&quot;.
Attacks against Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
Wrote a lady from Miami in a web: &quot;This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a lot of chutzpah: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had a total of two black governors and five black senators!&quot;
In reality they are attacks that don&#39;t say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the voters&#39; question: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says Obama will win and by a good margin.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth, we know very well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
A side of the US mentality that was kept covered up until the very end comes out.
&quot;Say what you want, then we&#39;ll take care of where to put the cross, whether Obama or McCain&quot;.
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, that the success of the black candidate appears almost certain.
However, despite all this reasoning, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and got its ass kicked home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Still, Iraq was Bush&#39;s weak point for the majority.
Whoever takes over from George W will have a huge job to do.
Usa, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: it&#39;s time for cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the internet, the &quot;killer&quot; of the printed press.
Five hundred American journalists were polled by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don&#39;t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for US journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Also the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the papers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we do not want traditional journalism as understood by the general public to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that journalism nationwide is going down the wrong path.
In the local field the executive team is 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It&#39;s not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses are making their way to the internet, seen by many as the &quot;killer&quot; of print media.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; that journalists are feeling has increased by as much as 79%.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted they are embracing the technology in the hope that it will &quot;do some good&quot; for their journalism.
The biggest divide in American journalism today is between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the editors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with &quot;job security&quot;.
Executives who expect to lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationwide.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
&quot;Safe work&quot; at staff level (our editors, ed) is always on the agenda in America.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want and thus it becomes a question of &quot;take it or leave it&quot;, take or leave.
Editors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, plus pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days after the first year, a total of after the third year to reach a total of 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often get &quot;sick&quot; during the year.
It&#39;s all about the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT, DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the motion of property developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his hometown, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-agreement relating to the Unipol-Bnl takeover.
During the trial against him, last week, he obtained his release from house arrest transformed into an obligation to reside in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the developer could travel the route from the provincial town to a house in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (to which the prosecutor gave an opposing opinion) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence accusing him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote in the House of Representatives against the 700 billion dollar bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
Yesterday&#39;s New York Times confirms this by informing us that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, in favor of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul on the other hand, conservative, hostile to &quot;those from Washington&quot; and to the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, to be precise, which overwhelmingly made itself alive with the vow I mentioned at the beginning.
However, this just mentioned is only an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake perhaps heralds or already lets us see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not only here.
Both in the US and in Europe, the crisis seems to be working as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubating for some time and which solidify and finally come to light in the new climate.
The first of these phenomena is the re-enactment, the extraordinary re-launching of the dual category State-sovereignty in relation to a sort of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is the crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close ties with foreign countries, but which above all see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single State.
Which immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: namely how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically worldwide but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or doesn&#39;t have much to say: the clear proof is given by the European Union which, divided as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies, is unable to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of every single State that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the disbursement of funds: since when it gets cornered it is only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back on track.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of to an analogous extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the national-state element is moreover in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely connected to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the web, of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that the instead, our future will have to come to terms increasingly with those very little immaterial things such as water, crops, oil.
All things which, look at it, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are in any case absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So whoever happens to be sovereign certainly has many more cards than someone who is not, someone who has the misfortune of living in a place with no crops, no oil and no water.
I come to the second novelty which, however, heralds a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request for someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, especially the economic ones, which have proved so inadequate and full of gray areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
In other words, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites in vogue up to now, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the general meaning of the term seems to be gaining ground in vast sectors of the population , to have outlived its time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the request for leadership subtly feeds a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral &quot;riots&quot; or in the sudden changes in the collective moods of recent and very recent times, from conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labor consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
One gets the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats, some would say, are finding it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent , what is not taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies from today and which the economic crisis reinvigorates, increases, potentially agitates to excess.
Given all this, to speak of a &quot;revolt of the masses&quot; on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes peeled certainly isn&#39;t.
Superglue for walking on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars managed to keep a body weighing 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scholars is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
&quot;The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,&quot; explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure a perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the paws of these reptiles and at the same time &quot;detaches easily from the wall,&quot; explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the faculty of University of Dayton Engineering.
WALKING ON WALLS? -&quot;This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive,&quot; adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Perhaps yes, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering.
No superheroes yet.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of California, Berkeley, is also dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, the Californian scholars presented an adhesive made up of hair-like microfibers that clean themselves of dust as they move across a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed above all in the summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness according to the case, with even serious consequences for health.
The risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines were reiterated by David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society underway in Philadelphia is launching a new alarm : a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, canceling their beneficial effects and putting patients&#39; health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already come under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing the effects of some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
DRUGS AT RISK - The Italian Medicines Agency itself reported it in an information bulletin two years ago, alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to be careful what you drink if you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, even orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: &quot;These discoveries are generally immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies which eventually change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, don&#39;t be impressed but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarifications» the expert underlined to the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known columnist for the New York Times.
Krugman is a major critic of the Bush administration&#39;s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, in the days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked quite a few controversies and which was held against the economist for years, but which has now proved to be correct.
&quot;I&#39;m surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have faded from public attention,&quot; Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an &quot;economist of great value&quot;, but also a popularizer with a &quot;very aggressive style, particularly critical of the liberal excesses of the Bush administration&quot;.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the &quot;anti-Microsoft&quot; package»
It&#39;s the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from the home to the office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the better known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year&#39;s work by volunteer developers, who are supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows itself to the general public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised and less spartan interface, if they add more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new Open Document Format (ODF) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific features of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, &quot;hybrid PDF&quot; documents can be created, which combine the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet it is possible to intervene with several hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on modifications, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during review.
Some companies are also working to bring some features of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system as usual.
Upon request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a driving force for diffusion in homes, it is precisely in the business sphere that the Open Office suite is attempting the big bet, already being able to count on various projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there are also companies that offer an ideal training, consultancy and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for word processing equivalent to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for emulating Powerpoint presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Finally, Draw is the graphics module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is probable that we could even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also tests positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best climber&#39;s jersey.
The news was reported by the website of the newspaper L&#39;Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analyzes on Kohl&#39;s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms Cera&#39;s positivity, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will face the canonical two-year disqualification.
The news of Kohl&#39;s positivity at the third generation EPO was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian finished on the final podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka-dot jersey of best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy &quot;from a country of emigrants has only recently turned into a prime destination for immigrants&quot; welcomed with reluctance.
Is this turning Italy into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article which dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originally from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits .
This case highlights what the NYT calls the &quot;paradox of the north&quot;: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is &quot;more integration and more work&quot; but also the &quot;highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support to the Northern League&quot;.
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation desired by the League which tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
A trend underlined by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinal Palace, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism&quot;.
Billionaire Steve Fossett&#39;s plane found
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The wreckage was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that still remained: &quot;The plane has been located, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is precisely the one that Steve Fossett was flying on the day in which he disappeared,&quot; he said at a news conference.
The sheriff then specified that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was presumed dead in February.
The American Transportation Safety Office (NTSB) announced that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the sighting of the wreck, which then identified the aircraft: it is precisely the Bellanca 8kcab, missing since 3 September 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett&#39;s personal effects were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett&#39;s name, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been halted a month after her disappearance.
The billionaire had earned his place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a two-week flight around the world in a balloon.
Three years later he had flown around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among his many records, also that of having flown at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don&#39;t expect
An unconventional SUV with an original and well-defined design with decisive lines, large surfaces and sharp angles.
In short, this is the Glk, the latest among the &quot;compact&quot; off-roaders from the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a breath of fresh air in this sector.
Precisely because of its contents outside the traditional canons, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk SUV will also be unexpected and unconventional, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next 17 October.
Thus the hype that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch a brand new method of communication also through a futuristic 3D billboard campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi billboards, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the central Milan shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in an almost real dimension and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in all its details at different times, to then be recomposed into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future buyers with this formula? We will see.
This is who the Italian hooligans are
Of the Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the &quot;Ultras Italia&quot; group which has been following the national team for years and which, to tell the truth, has never created excessive problems up to now.
Nor had he ever clashed with opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added small groups (a few units, in reality) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags showing the cities of origin of the militants: on Saturday evening they were removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a supporter of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all by name, therefore easily verifiable.
And the Interior Ministry had in fact checked them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with a Daspo in progress, no one who had been prevented from attending a stadium.
Four Azzurri fans, who had a history of stadium crimes, had in fact been refused tickets and prevented from traveling.
Now the Viminale is waiting to read the documents that will arrive from the Bulgarian police and then it will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or to those identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only Italian stadiums but throughout Europe.
In short, our hooligans will never set foot in a stadium again.
Fortunately.
But now there is fear-emulation: that is, that those little more than one hundred and fifty are joined by others.
&quot;We must put this fire out immediately and not legitimize those who behave in this way,&quot; argued the Viminale.
Therefore, &quot;eyes wide open especially in view of the national team match on Wednesday in Lecce&quot;.
Indeed, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, that is of the secret services, which deals precisely with stadium problems.
&quot;The Duce-Duce choirs and the outstretched arm during the Mameli anthem? It&#39;s not a crime in Bulgaria...&quot;.
This is the thought (expressed in a very unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminale Observatory for a few weeks now (he took the place that previously belonged to Francesco Tagliente and then to Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been questore of Trieste where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to praise the Duce but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was certainly shameful.
&quot;I&#39;m not a sociologist - adds the number 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed to the country where the crime took place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let&#39;s also talk about booing Mameli&#39;s anthem: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not education...&quot;.
Students who are victims of high rents of up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students knows no crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants&#39; union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has now assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study due to the very high overall costs that the families of origin would have to bear - explains the head of the Sunia research office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has distorted the market so much as to trigger a generalized increase process also for residents&quot;.
In the majority of cases, the rental offers also contain a series of violations: unregistered, unregistered contracts with no rental limit, connected sub-rentals.
Extraordinary interventions are needed for Sunia which, through the revision of the taxation, can control prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, about 450 euros are needed for a bed in the Brianza area; for a single room it ranges from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room around 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, 250/280 euros are needed for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), around 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples you need 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room you spend between 400 and 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari you need 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they carry more weight in the city&#39;s economy.
Finally, in cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-EU students is more frequent, such as Perugia, a further anomaly is recorded: the increase of about 25/30% of the rent asked of foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities are canceling the historic cinemas
Historic movie theaters close in favor of multiplexes.
&quot;A city without cinemas is a blind city, it&#39;s like a face without eyes&quot;.
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth of large multiplexes in the suburbs and the consequent death through consumption of single-screens in the central areas of cities, is one of those events that appear to us inescapable and incontrovertible, but which also has all the characteristics of a real own cultural crime.
What often disappears are historical places full of memories, &quot;it is as if a friend were missing, an acquaintance with whom we shared a part of the road and so many emotions&quot;, observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago earned Tornatore the Academy Award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for a way of experiencing cinema lost perhaps forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of exhibitors, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed their doors, and the cinemas in the main cities are paying the greatest price: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures, Emilia-Romagna excels with 82 single-screen cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And demonstrating that the advent of the multiplexes is primarily responsible for their disappearance, these are precisely the three Italian regions that recorded the largest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«The Italian exhibition has developed irrationally» observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, &quot;it is useful to build new structures but the survival of the existing ones should be guaranteed, because when a city hall closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of allocation for the fund in favor of the exhibitors: the state&#39;s past debt is around 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be needed».
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city which, worried about closures, decided to take measures by signing a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote single-screen cinemas both in the historic center and in the suburbs.
Among the envisaged rules there are tax relief measures in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking and in some car parks.
&quot;I like this initiative&quot; observes Giuseppe Tornatore &quot;and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is certain, however, that to counter the overwhelming power of multiplexes, traditional cinemas must also improve the quality of sound and image, because today&#39;s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make &quot;Nuovo cinema Paradiso&quot;, which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the now closed Rialto or Quirinale in via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, I turn away in order not to see the billboards blackened by dust».
Links between politics and the &#39;Ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to align the choices of the Municipality with the interests of the Piromalli gang&quot;.
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria make against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in a mafia association, are heavy.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer nephew, namesake of the boss, already convicted of mafia-type criminal association, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
&quot;In defiance of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense&quot;, write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay lawyer Piromalli for consultancy.
&quot;The gang would thus have been allowed - the judges wrote - to officially enter the town halls, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration&quot;.
The president of the Calabrian regional council Agazio Loiero does not hide that &quot;there are many collusions between local authorities and organized crime&quot; in his region: &quot;There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable .
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressure of the &#39;Ndrangheta, heroes who keep clean&quot;.
This morning&#39;s arrests follow those of last July in which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and again due to alleged influences between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of its dissolution, had been elected to head a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 runoff.
He cried foul when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called into question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having engineered everything for a political matter, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli gang had even gone so far as to ask for a variation of the project of the A3.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the prosecutors write, emerged &quot;the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group notoriously close to the Piromalli, aligning the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang&quot;.
When energy comes from the waves now the big names take the field
It is an immense deposit, which occupies over 70% of the planet&#39;s surface and is now being discovered by the world&#39;s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which giants like Chevron have set their sights, and are now trying to get their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for the past one hundred years and in the 1970s, coinciding with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell in the 1980s, the idea of harnessing marine energy was shelved, but now environmental concerns and the new rise in oil are boosting the industry.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world&#39;s electricity needs could be covered by plants that exploit the wave motion of the seas.
This amount would be double that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
Plus there would be currents and tides.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years on, more and more are betting on marine energy and among these are companies that have always devoted themselves to traditional energy.
&quot;Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil giant to the Wall Street Journal business newspaper - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us&quot;.
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, necessary to start a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is no small sign, above all if one considers that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey which are following the path of energy that comes from the sea and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, according to observers indicate an interest on the rise.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not dispel all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The buoyancy of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure spins a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent ashore via submarine cables.
For now there are four plants of this type in the planning stage, awaiting federal approval and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York&#39;s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides spins turbine blades, creating a rotary motion that powers a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers awaiting the necessary permits to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Of particular interest, say the Institute for Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of the tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others bordering the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments of up to 35 million for 2009.
