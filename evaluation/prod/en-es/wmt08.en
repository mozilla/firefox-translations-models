Food: Where European inflation slipped up
The skyward zoom in food prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation.
November price hikes were higher than expected in the 13 eurozone countries, with October's 2.6 percent yr/yr inflation rate followed by 3.1 percent in November, the EU's Luxembourg-based statistical office reported.
Official forecasts predicted just 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
As opposed to the US, UK, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut interest rates, arguing that a rate drop combined with rising raw material prices and declining unemployment would trigger an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to hold inflation to under two percent, or somewhere in that vicinity.
According to one analyst, ECB a has been caught in a Catch-22: It needs to "talk down" inflation, to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game.
Germany's November inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a record; in Spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6.
Soaring food and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere.
Wheat futures were up by 88 percent and soybean prices were at their highest since 1973.
Consumers also have had to pay significantly more for vegetable oils and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil shot up by 52 percent this year, with the black gold costing nearly 100 dollars a barrel last month.
The ECB predicts that 2008 inflation will climb to 2.5 percent from the earlier 2.1, but will drop back to 1.9 percent in 2009.
Analysts see the 12-month inflation rate as holding steady at about 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but say that the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
They also predict that the ECB will cut interest rates twice during the course of 2008.
Government crisis coming, says Gallup
Fidesz support shot up significantly in early December after a lengthy period of just holding its own. This gives it the strongest support base it has seen since 2002, while Gallup reports support for the socialists at an all-time low of 13 percent.
Among people with a clear party preference, given the stronger resolve of opposition voters, Fidesz support exceeds the two-thirds mark (71 percent), while MSZP has garnered but one-fifth (20 percent).
The poll puts MDF and SZDSZ numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament; garnering about 2 percent support each within the entire sample.
Among people with clear party preferences who say they definitely would vote, support for these two parties is 3 percent each.
The public mood regarding the economy has managed to sink even lower than the rock-bottom last measured. The proportion who believe the country's economy is in the pits is an unprecedented 41 percent, while another 46 percent just think it is in bad shape.
Following higher hopes in spring and summer, people are again more pessimistic about the financial prospects for their families.
For next year, over half the public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts an improvement.
In Gallup's December poll, more respondents than ever before - 71 percent - said the prime minister was doing a poor rather than a good job.
Thirteen percent of the sample said it trusted or highly trusted Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent put their trust in Viktor Orbán.
Fifty-four percent said they did not trust the PM, while 27 percent said they mistrusted the Fidesz chairman.
One gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without having to put a new government in office.
Following last October's rioting, 35 percent of the public thought it would be best to keep the government and PM in office. By now that proportion is down to 20 percent and the relative majority (33 percent) believes new elections should be held.
When queried about interest in a referendum, 60 percent of the sample said it definitely would vote in one, while another 20 percent said it most likely would go to to the polls.
In comparison, only 55 percent said it would definitely vote "in parliamentary elections if they were to be held this Sunday" while another 15 percent said it most likely would cast a ballot. Given current determination to vote, the referendum is certain to be valid.
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees, 79 percent to scrap co-payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem hospital charges.
Looking only at the ratios of people who say they definitely will vote in the referendum, we find that 81 percent are against tuition fees, 84 percent are against doctor co-payments and 89 percent oppose hospital per diems.
Auchan prices are highest, Tesco's are up by almost 20 percent
The giant supermarkets located in the shopping triangle at Budaörs hiked prices by an average of 16 percent for the second year in a row, though they did not have to contend with a VAT increase which they did last year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
Prices In Napi's usual Christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent again this year in the Budaörs shopping triangle, with each of the giant supermarkets pushing prices up by well over a thousand forints.
Since supermarket prices went through the roof last December, the hikes did not look quite as drastic percentage-wise, when compared to that high base.
Nonetheless, it has to be a shock to consumers to discover that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for well under nine thousand a year ago.
Napi's basket exceeded the psychological HUF 10,000 limit by a minimum of HUF 91 at the giant supermarkets tested.
The most expensive basket cost us 10 573 forints.
(in 2003, the same basket came to 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish stayed at roughly last year's level, but boneless turkey breast, walnuts, and poppy seeds were up significantly.
We found the price of flour and bread to be mostly in line with official Statistics Office data, though we discovered bread going for 139 forints a kilogram at Auchan.
The competition factor was not enough to push the product's price down to under 200 forints.
Another surprise in this store was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola in a bottle with a deposit on it, so the full price including deposit was still only 257 forints.
Nevertheless, this year Napi's basket cost the most at Auchan and the least at Cora.
We worked the numbers and found that Napi's basket cost 15 percent more than last Christmas at Cora, while it was 18 percent more expensive at both Tesco and Auchan.
The difference between last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket cost was 12 percent, while the gap between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive one was 21 percent.
In forints, the average increase was 1,480.
Last year, the average increase came to 1,206 forints, which included the effects of a VAT hike.
And this was the factor that totally confused the commerce sector. The supermarkets were obviously unable to decide on the size of the price gap to apply to specific products, finding it impossible to calculate the effect the price increases would have on consumption.
(If the outlet makes a mistake in calculating the turnover velocity of a product, it stands to take a major hit on its profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity.)
Last year, with the VAT hike the price increase in Napi's basket ran up against such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level, while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive.
This year, there were no such extremes, with the most expensive basket being 1,630 forints up from last year while the cheapest was 1,284 forints higher.
A comparison of the two Christmas seasons threw light on a disastrous jump in prices. In less than 20 months, day-to-day consumer goods soared by over 30 percent in the giant supermarkets.
(This is not quite in line with official Statistics Office data: its figures show price increases of over 30 percent in just 12 months for certain basic foodstuffs
including both flour and eggs.)
Napi's basket suggested that this latter was a near impossibility, since we found that the price was was up by just a shade over 10 percent on last year's quite high base price, even where it was most expensive.
It does appear though, that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg producers, for they have managed to force their drastic price increases onto the multinationals.
Nonetheless, none of the supermarkets in the golden shopping triangle were complaining. All regularly reported that they were having a good year.
We found that most shoppers in the three outlets visited were not really interested in prices.
They tended to shop in bulk, buying durable foodstuffs by the pallet.
On a Wednesday morning there were long queues at all cash registers following a sudden increase in shoppers.
However, to our knowledge, turnover is lower in the rural areas. Several of the multis have been complaining to pollsters that their inflow has been below the anticipated level in both groceries and durable consumers.
Many hospitals try to save by cutting disinfectant use
Hospitals have registered over a thousand cases of infections triggered mainly by the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hospital cleanliness, overcrowding, and overburdened staff are not conducive to halting infections, said the division chief at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many places even try cutting back on disinfectant use to save money.
An MRSA - an antibiotic resistant staphylococcus - infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of János hospital.
The infection was detected in a man who had been hospitalized after a major accident.
The patient was isolated.
The same hospital had had to contend with a similar infection early this year.
It had discharged a patient admitted after a serious traffic accident. Shortly afterward, it had to re-admit the patient because of an MRSA infection, and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be vital to full recovery because they have been unable to get rid of the staph.
This year, up to 10th of December, hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief Karolina Böröcz.
This tells us the number of cases of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that hospitals actually included in their records, but nothing more.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSAs, whose official name is a methicillin (oxacillin) resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of all people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it ever causing an infection.
The infections SA does cause (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, minor skin infections, and wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated.
However, if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used, the bacteria that originally responded well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic-resistant variety, which spreads rapidly in hospitals if hygienic conditions are lax.
Particularly at risk are elderly and low-body-weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised. Among these patients, the staph can cause serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis.
According to János Hospital's medical director, there is nothing unusual about having an MRSA infection since they are part of everyday hospital life.
One should not confuse an infection with an epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi says. MRSA will be found everywhere anyone bothers to test for it, he adds.
Antibiotic resistance
"We isolate patients with MRSA and nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when working with infected patients. We also have the appropriate antibiotics needed to treat them," says Nyulasi.
When a patient is admitted to the hospital, one of the first things done is to check for the presence of MRSA, but hospitals are still vulnerable to infection.
Testing for the staph isn't fashionable
The vast majority of nosocomial MRSA-induced infections could be prevented said Böröcz. However, she added that current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic-resistant infections.
Since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should routinely check all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
But, taking microbiological samples from patients is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
One reason is that the National Health Insurance Fund does not cover the costs of these tests.
In most cases the bacteria remain unnoticed unless the patient has an obvious MRSA infection, said the National Centre for Epidemiology physician-in-chief.
The European Union has stringent protocols on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and Hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies.
The goal should be targeted therapy, meaning that microbiology tests should be conducted to prevent resistance from evolving, but hospitals do not always keep to this.
It is even rarer to take a microbiology sample among outpatients in primary or specialized care, Böröcz added.
Saving money by cutting back on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that the most common way MRSA is transferred from one patient to another through healthcare personnel who carry it from patient to patient.
Therefore, washing hands, and wearing gloves and masks play a significant role in prevention, but here again, we find many shortcomings in hospital practices.
MRSAs are transmitted through physical contact and body fluids. Under domestic hospital conditions, an infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In fact, hospital wards are often overcrowded, with beds too close to one another although they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements.
Sadly, we also find that when hospitals are short on funds they tend to save on disinfectants, said Böröcz, adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients, chances of infection increase.
According to Böröcz, there are demonstrably fewer infections, and those that occur are easier to prevent from spreading, in hospitals that take appropriate protective measures.
Government programme to combat MRSA
Treating MRSA infections costs the health insurer huge amounts of money, so efforts should be made everywhere to keep them from occurring in the first place.
In the UK for example, the government has a programme in place to cut back MRSA and prevent its spread.
The programme appears to be successful for published data shows that MRSA is on the decline in the UK.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has set prevention of the evolvement of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and of nosocomial infections as a priority project.
Police chief causing fatal accident was not drunk
An official professional opinion has been submitted regarding a fatal accident caused by Budapest's District 22 police chief.
Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Budapest Municipal Prosecutor's Office, issued a statement on Friday, on receipt of the professional opinion. The opinion unequivocally concludes that the District 22 police chief, who has resigned, could not have been under the influence of alcohol or any other substance when he hit and fatally injured a pedestrian on Tuesday.
The professional opinion supported the result of the preliminary investigation which concluded that the former police chief had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The former District 22 police chief was driving his own car in his district. He turned around a corner and hit a 55 year-old man attempting to cross Kossuth Lajos Street at a spot where there was no marked pedestrian crossing.
(The absence of an official crossing point is not a mitigating circumstance, since traffic rules mandate that pedestrians have the right of way over a turning vehicle,)
The pedestrian died shortly after arrival at a hospital.
The district police chief resigned because of the accident and requested that he be retired from the force because, said a police communique, he was so shaken by the event.
The Budapest Prosecutor's investigative arm is conducting an inquiry.
The former police chief has been cooperating fully with the prosecutors investigating the case, Morvai added.
Additional 400 million euros available for infrastructure
Four hundred million euros in loans will become available for education, transportation, the environmental infrastructure and energy development in the wake of three accords signed by Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka, in Budapest on Friday.
EIB approved a framework package of 300 million euros in 2006 to help the Hungarian budget finance transportation and environmental projects being implemented by the cohesion fund. A concrete agreement for 100 million from the package was signed earlier, so one new contract covers use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The second agreement, for 150 million euros, will help the budget finance education-related projects.
EIB has already approved a 300 million euro package for Hungary to use for upgrades to these areas. The extra 150 million euros can be used later, when the credit agreement is extended.
The third agreement was for 50 million euros to be used for innovation. The central budget plans to incorporate it primarily into a R&D project at Debrecen University.
The talks included a new metro line under construction in Budapest.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes metro financing details with the EU, they would revisit the original contracts to see whether they needed to be amended, and if so, how.
Veres said he believed that latter discussion would take place in the first quarter of 2008.
EIB has provided Hungary with the equivalent of 8.4 billion euros since 1990, which were used to finance 113 projects.
EIB is linking interest rates on the loans to the EURIBOR. It is allowing an 8 year grace period, and is charging no commission to maintain fund availability.
Bulgaria: The EU's real estate paradise
The real estate market in Bulgaria has been developing at an unbelievable rate - all of Europe has its eyes on this heretofore rarely heard-of Balkan nation.
Who is buying what and where on this market, which is still the cheapest in the EU despite rapidly rising prices?
This analysis comes from RE/MAX's Bulgarian division.
No question but that Bulgaria is the most sought-after East European real estate target, with its low-cost ski chalets and oceanfront homes.
The most fashionable mountain sites are Bansko, Borovets, Pamporovo and Vitosha, while on the seaside the areas to which people are flocking are Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sunny Beach, and ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, although a rising number of investors are looking into real estate around Karvarna and Balcsik, too.
According to RE/MAX Bulgaria analysts, sooner or later, the central portion of the country will begin attracting investors. So a growing number of people are already buying properties in Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Tryavna -, and more and more investors are looking around the Rousse area, which is expressly cheap at the moment.
Sofia, the capital, also has many attractive opportunities. Commercial and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on the way to becoming one of Europe's most exciting golf paradises. This means it need not only be a priority destination in winter and summer, for it has the resources to attract visitors during the other two seasons, too.
Forward-thinking investors are already making major purchases, for instance, in and around Bansko.
Analysts suggest that people who buy real estate in Bulgaria would also like to change their lifestyles.
Most investors are from Britain, but many also come from France, Belgium, and Spain, with a growing number coming from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors have also gained a foothold, while Russians are traditional big-time buyers at the Black Sea and along top ski slopes.
There are three types of international buyers, said regional manager of RE/MAX Bulgaria Georgi Yankov.
The ones who plan to resettle in Bulgaria either purchase renovated properties for prices ranging from 50,000 euros to 100,000, or old fixer-uppers for 5,000-15,000 and then renovate them themselves.
They want their purchases to be easy to access, and to be equipped for modern communication. It is important that they be in a big city, with shopping and, generally, a local doctor nearby.
The next group of buyers is interested in summer homes (Bulgaria joined Germany's list of top-ten holiday destinations in December).
The third includes investors for business purposes, who are counting on medium or long-term appreciation.
Real estate prices in Sofia, the capital, are rising steadily, as is demand.
While Bulgaria boasts the European Union's lowest real estate prices, they have still gone up by 21 percent in the past five years.
Actually, the rise in real estate prices has exceeded the growth in salaries.
EnvironMin and Hungary's six percent
Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor has said that professional level meetings on post-2012 international climate issues will end on Tuesday. The conference itself officially opens on Wednesday, when the ministers take up the matter.
Professionals and politicians from 192 countries are slated to discuss the Bali Roadmap that focuses on efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol expires.
At present the developing and developed nations are in the middle of a heated dispute.
The United States has let it be known that it is unwilling to negotiate precise numbers although it is not opposed to agreeing to a 25-40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 when compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the developed nations are ready not only to reduce their emissions but also to offer financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
One agreement reached was on support to developing nations.
A 16-member board will manage the funding for this, which is set by the Kyoto Protocol, and will most likely work within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), writes the local publication Piac és Profit.
Hungary's six percent
Representing Hungary. Environment Minister Gábor Fodor is ready to support EU endeavours to retain its flagship role in the global climate protection effort and promote a new international accord, to be reached by 2009.
Fodor noted that the EU has its sights on a 20 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990, whether the "post-2012 agreement" is reached or not, and is ready to cut them by 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the globe and developing nations are also ready to accept obligations to the extent of their abilities and responsibilities.
Fodor said that back in 1997, the countries adhering to the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a 5.2 percent reduction in emissions overall. Within that group, the 15-member EU agreed to an 8 percent decline.
Hungary agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-1987, a goal it intends to meet, said the environment ministry's press release.
The stakes in Bali are high, for a long-term international agreement on climate policy needs to be under wraps within two years or it surely will not be able to go into effect by 2012.. Should that happen, the pledges made during the validity of the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed up immediately by another emissions-reduction regime, the need for which the UN's Nobel-Prize winning scientific body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - IPCC- has pointed out in its latest report.
The result could be a delay in emissions reduction, which would put Earth on a certain course towards an average temperature rise exceeding 2 degrees Celsius. Should that happen, scientists say the consequences would be dire and irreversible.
UK uses YouTube as military recruiting tool
British military units have been sharing their Iraqi and Afghanistani actions through video clips on You Tube in an effort to popularize their missions.
The Royal Air Force (RAF) was the first to develop a taste for YouTube: its special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading video clips showing how they have been combating the Taliban since March 2006, BBC reports.
The images, taken with miniature cameras attached to troop helmets, are monitored by a command centre in Kandahar and then transferred to London from where they are uploaded onto the Internet.
There's no mistaking the political message
Fully 139 RAF images have been uploaded onto the Internet and so far over they have received over 75,000 hits.
The UK defence ministry has been registered since spring 2007 as "defence headquarters", regularly uploading video clips on Iraqi and Afghanistani actions, while the Commonwealth Office and the Multinational Force - Iraq (MNF-I) have their own You Tube channels.
Introduction to Afghanistan
The RAF originally uploaded the videos as a recruitment tool. The defence ministry says they have also been a good way to let the public know the real purpose of keeping the forces abroad.
Publicity disseminated through this avenue costs almost nothing when compared to traditional recruitment commercials on television, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC. At the same time, they inadvertently carry a bit of a political message for, in a special way, they offer insight into the reasons why the government ordered the ongoing military actions.
The Americans have turned it into a game
A problem the military has to contend with involves the amateur videos being shared alongside the carefully edited and censured official clips, which sometimes even show dying soldiers. In the slightly hypocritical "official" clips, officers will at most talk about their losses but the bloody side of the fighting is never actually shown.
Quite a number of videos from the Iraqi and Afghanistani battlefields showing live action have been posted on the Internet, but British forces have only recently joined in the postings.
American recruitment is a bit different. The US has been using America's Army, a tactical shooting game available for free download, as a recruiting tool. In it players become soldiers in a more-or-less realistic simulation of fighting forces.
Raffle tickets and savory scones dominate ministry Christmas party
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth appears not to have a sensitive side: she is holding an end-year staff conference instead of a Christmas party, though coffee and savory scones will be served.
Other ministries plan parties with live bands, while still others are giving out raffle tickets and a glass or two of Christmas spirits to enhance the mood and find a way into the hearts of staff.
Celebrations, Christmas spirit, concerts and smorgasbord - how the powerful party.
Government offices also get ready for Christmas.
This year the defence ministry is planning the biggest ministry Christmas party, but the guests won't been ministry staffers.
It's Orphans' Christmas will have gifts for the children of soldiers killed while serving, it's Mission Christmas will invite the families of soldiers currently serving in international missions, and its press reception will be for the media.
The ministry plans on spending 25 million for year-end mood enhancement.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) are kicking up their heels and partying more ardently than the other government offices.
GKM is holding its party at the House of the Future, and spending HUF 4,320,000 on the package for about 350 of its 600 staff members.
It is focusing on creating a true Christmas atmosphere, and will have live performers and a raffle with prizes.
NFÜ spent 4,700,000 forints on its Christmas cheer, holding its celebration at the headquarters of the National Justice Administration Council (OIT) on Wednesday. It is offering guests a series of concert performances and dinner.
The hall rental cost one million forints, and the rest went on the more than four hundred invited guests.
We have been told that one division within NFÜ has been invited to another Christmas party, too: a bid management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt), will be celebrating with EU money.
It rented out the entire Vígszínház theatre for the event.
MAG Zrt did not confirm this, as we were unable to find anyone in charge.
Informal dress is fine
OIT headquarters played host not only to NFÜ but also to the Justice and Law Enforcement Ministry, which decided to hold a Lucia Day ball on December 7, instead of a Christmas party.
OIT did not charge this group for use of its building.
About 500 people attended the ball.
The party got underway with a toast by the minister, and after the dinner there was dancing to live music.
When questioned [by origo] they said that formal dress was not mandatory for either women or men.
The ministries of health, labour and local government organized more puritan dances.
The health ministry ran a celebration for its staff at its own headquarters, spending 400,000 forints on the event.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth didn't even call it a Christmas party, just a year-end staff conference.
The ministry expects 180 guests, said its media department, who will be offered only coffee and savory scones to stay within a budget of HUF 350.000.
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai plans only to drink a simple toast with staff in the assembly hall of the Ministry for Local Government and Regional Development.
The finance ministry (PM) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own assembly hall and has invited 436 staff members.
It plans to spend HUF 2,500 per guest for the Christmas party, which will include a smorgasbord buffet and one toast per person.
PM workers have welcomed Christmas in this fashion every year since János Veres became minister.
People don't actually plan to party - the mood will remain official, thanks partly to the minister who intends to make a speech, and partly to the timing - it will be in the afternoon.
The farm ministry is holding off for a New Year's reception, which will be on January 20, so there won't be any Christmas celebration.
Its reception will be at a Vajdahunyad castle in the City Park, and the ministry reported that it plans to spend 1,000 forints per guest, for 100 guests.
The media department underlined that it was offering a very simple buffet meal, to which it was inviting only the professional diplomats accredited to Hungary.
The reception, a repeat of one held annually for some time now, will again begin with a brief greeting from the minister and end with just a bit of snacking.
The foreign and education ministries do not intend to hold any Christmas parties at all, the media departments told Origo.
The environment ministry was unable to tell us the cost of its office Christmas.
At any rate, it has invited over 400 guests to a party it plans to hold at the Museum of Applied Arts.
Forces for a huge strike come together
On Friday, the Liga Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Councils (MOSZ) will put together a strike committee charged with coordinating an open-ended strike set to start on Monday.
They plan to hold a protest rally on Saturday and on Monday - the day parliament is scheduled to vote a health insurance bill into law - they will begin their work stoppage.
The strike is certain to snarl the transport network, for rail traffic will come to a more or less complete halt and Budapest public transport will be frozen until 1.00 p.m..
Liga and the Workers' Council federation will publicize details of their jointly organized Monday walkout on Friday afternoon..
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is being set up to coordinate Monday's industrial action.
Organizers plan to hold a public protest demonstration on Saturday, and the organizations joining the strike will begin an open-ended work stoppage on Monday unless they can come to prior agreement with the government.
What this means is that they have not set a termination date for the walkout, beginning as of the day parliament adopts the health insurance bill.
If by some chance parliament fails to adopt the health insurance law, the unions will immediately retract their strike appeal.
If they adopt the bill, the strike committees will meet and decide on their next moves.
Given parliament's agenda for Monday, it is conceivable that the health insurance bill may not come up for a vote until evening or possibly not until late at night.
The strike that gets underway on Monday is certain to create significant delays in the transport system. The railways will stop running for an open-ended period of time, while a portion of Budapest public transport might be halted through noon, as might over half of the long-distance bus lines.
At the same time, there will be partial roadblocks on many of the nation's highways.
Many unions and civic organizations have responded to the strike appeal. A complete and regularly updated list of them is available on Liga's website.
Some organizations have announced open-ended strikes, while others are limiting themselves to temporary work stoppages.
As of Thursday afternoon no agreement had been reached between Hungarian railways MÁV and the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VDSZSZ), not even on minimum services, despite the fact that a growing number of people plan to travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach..
According to latest reports, the Budapest Transport Company will be out from the start of business till 1 p.m., Budapest Airport will halt work from 7 to 9 a.m., Liga's Power and Thermal Energy Unions will walk off the job for 4 hours, while the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers will hold 2-hours and 2-8 hour walkouts.
The National Federation of Physicians will hold a nationwide strike over staggered hours while the Democratic Union of Healthcare and Welfare Workers (EDDSZ), a part of the umbrella Union Cooperation Forum (SZEF), plans a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of Liga's four demands is that the government repeal its health insurance reform bill and submit a new concept for society-wide debate.
The second demand is that the new method for calculating pensions due to begin next year be introduced gradually instead of all at once.
The third is that when determining the occupations eligible for early retirement, the jobs to be included in the option be chosen before 2010.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VDSZSZ), a Liga union, rejected the offer submitted by the Economic and Transport Ministry on spur lines and wants it to make a new offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has heightened the country's risk level
Actions by the Hungarian Guard, established in August with the support of the Movement for a Righter Hungary, has raised the political risk level of Hungary and the entire region from a number of aspects, according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The research entity issued a "risk warning," writing: the actions of the Hungarian Guard are triggering an exceeding political risk "that the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy residents of Hungary could heat up to toxic levels as early as the short-term, leading to ethnic conflicts that could turn violent."
The major reason for this is that Hungarian Guard's political strategy appears to be aimed at provoking action of this nature, the research institute added.
This is the outcome of one of the most serious failures of Hungary's political players: "The primary actors in public life turned over public debate of Roma issues to representatives of the radical and extremist political forces, who have built a political strategy out of Gypsy-Hungarian differences."
This, Political Capital believes, has intensified the problem, rendering any normal dialogue impossible, reinforcing the extremists, and heightening the probability that violent conflicts will occur.
In addition, the research institute believes that the extensive domestic and international media attention to Hungarian Guard actions has "significantly damaged Hungary's international image, particularly as regards belief in the stability of the country and in the sophistication of its democracy."
They point out that the increasing publicity and impetus given to the re-organization of radical and far right groups in Hungary starting in the autumn of 2006 have been part of the reason why a number of organizations calling themselves "national self-defence" alliances were established starting in the summer of 2007.
"The common feature of these groups is that they call themselves civic organizations while openly declaring that they are preparing their members for defensive - including armed - tasks (citing disaster management, national defence, law enforcement) while declaring that the police and armed forces, in other words, the government, is unsuited for the role," Political Capital adds.
They noted that all of these moves have been made within a configuration that relies on society's anti-politics and anti-political-party mood to cloak various political ambitions under a mantle of civic action.
In other words, their emphasis on the civic nature of their actions and their choice of the association as their organizational form are not merely ruses to sidestep legal pitfalls to registration with the courts, but are also part of a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is heightening the risk of damaging our relations with our neighbours, too.
"In recent months several of Hungary's neighbours have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential hazard. The ultranationalist political players among some of these neighbours have referred to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard as an argument to justify their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All of these factors influence the political stability of the region," it adds.
The research institute notes that the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, and as such it heightens the political risk for the whole of the region.
It notes that the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, established in August 2007 by the far right Bulgarian National Union. (BNU).
Serious conflicts that broke out between Roma and non-Roma in a Sofia district (Krasna Polyana) were behind the establishment of the Bulgarian guard.
BNU took advantage of the disturbances to establish its guard, claiming that the goal of the organization was "national self-defence."
They argued that during the past 17 years Bulgaria had been subject to "Gypsy terror," in which the government was helpless and indifferent, Political Capital noted.
The initiative triggered heated debate among the Bulgarian public, it added.
One sign that the risk of ethnic conflict has increased, the analysts wrote, is that some Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced plans to establish a guard of their own as a resistance force.
Since the Hungarian Guard has so far acted quite similarly to the Bulgarian National Guard, it is quite possible that the Roma community of Hungary could respond to the threat by organizing their own self-defence, wrote Political Capital in warning of the risk.
Political Capital research manager Attila Juhász responded to a query from the MTI Hungarian wire service by saying that risk analysis was one of the research institute's chief activities.
Each year, he said, they publish risk analyses, and if they discover any factor that might alter risks, they notify public opinion by publishing a risk warning, as they have now done.
Holidays: Not everyone gets to enjoy the red-letter days
Hungarian law names the red-letter days specifically, and reorganizing working days to increase the number of days off around the holidays has become a general practice, although next year we will not see quite so much reorganization.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU or the USA either.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes among national holidays, state/bank holidays, and non-working days.
Non-working days are for the most part religious holidays and anniversaries of significant historical events.
Hungary celebrates New Year's Eve and Day: the final day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both non-working days - the latter if for no other reason, then to recover from New Year's Eve festivities.
There are a total of eleven red-letter days in each calendar year.
March 15 is a national holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 while October 23 commemorates the revolution of 1956.
August 20 marks the founding of the nation, while May Day is Labour Day. On November 1 and 2 we commemorate the dead, remembering our friends and relatives who have left us.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are each two-day holidays..
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend, it has become customary to reorganize the working week when there is only a single workday between the holiday and the weekend.
The long weekend comes with a price however, which is to have to spend the preceding or succeeding Saturday at work or in school.
For many years, the minister of labour has issued decrees naming the days on which we have to work to get extra day off between the holiday and the weekend.
The decree covers all employers and all workers they employ, as well as civil servants and public employees.
It does not cover staff in facilities, businesses or institutions that regularly operate round-the-clock, and where staff works 24/7.
The last changes this year will be around the end-of-year holidays. As of December 24, the whole country will come to a halt, for we have learned that most people find ways to take off the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, either by saving vacation days or by working longer hours before and after the holidays and taking comp time.
Next year most holidays will come during mid-week, so where will be less manipulation of the calendar than this year.
The first re-organization of the working week will occur to accommodate May Day and allow working people to have four consecutive days off.
Saturday, April 26 will be a workday, and in exchange, Friday, May 2 will be a day off.
The working week will be turned about again around the October 23 holiday. Saturday, October 18 will be a workday so that people may have Friday, October 24 off.
The end of the year, however, will be wall-to-wall holidays, with most people enjoying time off from December 24 through the New Year, even though New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six little things you can annoy your colleagues with
The e-mails we forget to send, the voice-mail messages we never get, the white lies we tell and no longer even notice - they can all colour day-to-day life on the job.
The question is whether you get used to the minor annoyances or pick up the gauntlet and deliberately avoid dubious situations that can irritate others.
A few tips.
"Oops, sorry. I forgot to tell you that marketing was looking for you," says one of your colleagues.
Oh, you missed a meeting because of that?
In a best case scenario, he or she will apologize and try to mend things. He or she might even phone marketing to explain about the forgotten message (this scenario is quite rare).
In most cases the matter ends with an apology.
Before getting into a situation where you have to apologize, it is worth thinking about the things you might do to give your colleagues a few unpleasant minutes, and then deliberately try to avoid doing them.
Do you borrow things that don't belong to you?
Nothing is more annoying than reaching for a document, piece of office equipment or telephone which turns out not to be there.
You remember having left your stapler on your desk but it appears to have grown wings overnight.
Perhaps you see the pen you thought you lost lying on your colleague's desk.
Don't take anything away from a colleague's desk without asking. They have every right to be angry if you make off with their belongings.
Do not pocket office envelopes or Post-It notes. It can be very irritating if they run out prematurely, especially if you're the one who needs one immediately.
Do you gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good way to halt gossip that has already begun to spread.
Who is doing what with whom?
Where and why?
There's no need to spread your information (assumptions) about your colleague all through the house!
If someone shares his or her most intimate secrets with you, do not abuse that trust!
Keep what you hear to yourself. When a colleague is out, do not discuss his or her private life with others, even if they also know what the person has been up to.
Do you call in sick, when you're not?
When you call in sick because of a splitting headache, or when you just don't feel good, or when you think it would be better to spend the day resting, think about the colleagues who will have to take up the slack and get all your urgent things done by deadline.
Do not play dirty with your colleagues!
If you know beforehand that you are not going to be in, or if something happens that forces you to stay home for a day, let your colleagues and supervisor know in advance. Don't surprise them by not showing up.
Humming, hooting, phoning
Have you ever been totally immersed in your work, only to lose your concentration because of guffawing colleagues?
Have you ever been an unwilling earwitness to a phone conversation it would have been better not to have heard.?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, singing, or loud talking (right over their heads), tapping rhythms with your feet, continuous cursing or loudly voiced complaints.
All of these things can be irritating, even if people are not concentrating on a project (writing, planning or organizing something) at that very moment.
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something isn't ready by deadline, if you forgot to send out an important letter or pass on a message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not blame chaotic conditions in the office - even if they exist - or your noisy colleagues!
Admit that you made the mistake and someone else suffered the consequences, and do what you can to make amends!
Ask how you can repair the damage and do what it takes to make things right!
Is the office too much like a second home?
Track suit and slippers: quite comfortable when you're at home, but they are not office wear!
Do not dress for leisure at the office, even if your job allows it!
Do not be sloppy. Show respect for your colleagues and yourself by dressing tastefully - and elegantly if your job requires it - to go to work.
the moment you decide to meet expectations, you cease to be interesting
I'm creeping along in the car in the usual morning traffic jam.
The radio starts playing an unusual tune: it's a violin sound with special electronic effects.
I give it a bit more volume.
The music changes beat and a base tone joins the other instruments. Then, like a true jewel, a female choir steps in.
I'm listening to Zagar's Wings of Love on mr2.
The domestic music world hasn't spoiled us with high quality electronic pop in a long time.
But now, all of a sudden you can look at the traffic jam in a new light while listening to the new Zagar CD.
The appearance of Yonderboi and the few new and exciting productions that have popped up from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture. Although guitar-pinging garage rock is back in style, domestic electropop is ready to prove that there IS something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer got his start in Pécs and even played in the Yonderboi ensemble for a time. Then, maybe because this town just wasn't big enough for the two of them - he moved on to do his own thing.
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music, and pop began pushing upward into the public ear when he was suddenly asked to compose soundtracks for films (such as
Ferenc Török's Ferenc Szezon [Season]).
A wider audience got to know his combos, which initially played in smaller clubs, when "wan2" magazine listed his first CD among Hungary's top 50 in 2002 and said Zagar was the only member of Yonderboi who was marketable in the west and who looked like a domestic trend-setter.
No question about it, Zagar and his group became "trendy." But, no one bothered to ask them if they liked the label.
The group responded with a new and even better CD.
Their latest, called Cannot Walk Fly Instead, which is just out, can open new vistas although in itself the title seeks to connect them to their early years in Pécs.
The title is a line used by Balázs Zságer's old Pécs group.
We would be on course with the easygoing reference to flight but for the effects of the louder guitar and the rock and roll beat that joins the soaring tones, homage to the spirit of the times.
György Ligeti, who sings in Britain with The Puzzle, made his intro with these tunes, when the disc was premiered at the Millenáris.
The CD produced a real radio hit. mr2 Petőfi, which of late has been playing pop music from morning till night, started a stealth offensive on our ears with Wings of Love and the soaring sounds produced by the six Hungarian female singers ("Underground Divas").
So, everything's okay. Or is it?.
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: The question this new hit song raises is just how culty your music has remained?
Zságer: I don't see much meaning in the term cult music.
I think there are two light music castes; not mainstream and underground and not alternative and pop, but commerce and honest.
So-called alternative or underground music can be dull and uninspiring and produced for the sole purpose of boosting sales, which puts it in the commerce category.
While a good pop song can be sparked by honest motives.
The attitudes of the recipients operate in that spirit, irrespectively of language and national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the receptivity of domestic and international audiences as far as your music goes?
B.Zs.: Light music has more tradition abroad, especially west of here.
Over there, older people also come to concerts, not just teens and twenty-somethings.
They pay far more attention to changes in the genre because they consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Do the people who listen to your music, and the number who listen make a difference?
B.Zs.: Of course it feels good to see more and more people at our concerts.
But we have never designed our music for the market.
Our music comes from inspiration, not some target or goal.
The role of the audience comes out at the concerts when the effects are contagious, but even that comes from the intangible changes triggered by the moment.
I have actually noticed that the moment you decide that you want to meet audience expectations, you cease to be interesting.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a soloist and has built a career west of where we are.
B.Zs.: We're not really following his path even though sometimes people claim to hear him in our music.
We are much stronger team players. We trust one another's musical presence and allow that to thrive.
In the beginning there was no way to avoid having our music compared to Yonderboi since several of us split from that group, though we chose a different road.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love hit first place on mr2 Petőfi's hit parade.
Many folks first heard the name Zagar with this number.
Was the more popular style a deliberate outreach to a broader audience?
B.Zs.: We never planned to have a hit to boost CD sales.
That song is about much more.
We intended it to wrap up the album, to try to lighten up the orgy of tone and the tougher themes earlier in the CD.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six female singers?
Why did you pick the voices you did - what was your guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to have a sound like a gospel choir.
The it occurred to us to put the choir together using soloists from the domestic music scene who sing really well.
That gave us the six-voice choir - of Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], and Juci Németh -, whom we simply named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the result exactly as you envisioned it, or did the girls play a role in shaping the sound?
B.Zs.: We had had an instrumental version of it for quite some time. But then, when we were putting the CD together, we got the feeling that we needed to add something.
The chordal sequence was crying out for a vocal section.
I sang the melody onto the instrumental that day, and that was how the girls learned it afterwards.
The whole thing came to me all at once and it was shockingly spontaneous.
I remember being totally excited by it at the time, but the Divas really were necessary to make it work.
It never would have been this powerful in my voice.
hvg.hu: The girls appeared to be secondary, on both the disc and at the concert.
There is no solo (excepting Judy Jay's tiny one), they have no separate role, they sing completely in unison and they don't outsing the music, so it's not as though they were singing to subordinate musical accompaniment.
On stage, they stood at the back.
Was all that deliberate?
B.Zs.: The reason why they stood at the back of the stage was because of technical problems.
But not distributing solos was deliberate.
The whole number was about forgetting our egos for a time, not caring who came from where and where they are headed, and simply letting those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to also get the feeling of the euphoria we went through when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one gave you the most work?
B.Zs.: None really, as far as the process of musical creation was concerned - but some of them gave us a hard time with the arrangement.
For instance Dorian Gray's Dilemma, where I play on a concert piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for the longest time - but everything eventually ended up fitting, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your own favourite number on this CD?
B.Zs.: That keeps changing with every concert, especially now that I've already let go of the CD.
At the moment it's Prophet is A Fool, Escape from the Earth, and Never the Same.
Deceiving Broker Ventured Billions due to Inferiority Complex
A perfidious embezzler.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka (Commerce Bank), labels its ex-employee Jerome Kerviel.
On his account it has lost almost five billion Euro.
More likely, it seems that Kerviel was just a big gambler who wanted to match his colleagues, and, moreover, definitely not an unqualified one.
Unlike all the big banking houses, he recognized the crisis at the American mortgage market in time.
"He is psychologically weak," were the words of his superiors, who directed the police to him.
But, as follows from Kerviel's testimony, which has been published by French media, e.g. the Le Monde journal, he was a man who gained 1.6 billion Euro from his transactions by the end of last year.
A Crisis Not Only in the U.S.
"All I ever wanted was to gain some money for my bank," he claims in his testimony.
In the summer he managed to gain a half billion Euro from this American crisis.
He had found the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
The news appeared in February that the so-called sub-prime mortgage loans, provided to low-income clients or to those who had problems with paying them off in the past, are going to have problems.
Nevertheless, the crisis should not have influenced the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and it was the right bet.
By the end of the year, his profit had climbed to 1.6 billion Euro.
"Even when I gained the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," admits Kerviel and adds that he definitely didn't keep any of it for himself.
Throughout the entire hearing he has admitted that he forged the records so that he would not be revealed.
He managed to deceive his superiors, even though the Eurex Exchange became interested in his affairs.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Was he afraid that he would be discovered?
Rather not.
"I thought that the simple fact of my gaining 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.
Where did he get the will to risk that much?
He had to work up to his position gradually.
He entered Société Générale in the 2000, immediately after he had finished his university studies in Lyon.
His annual income was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant to the broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual income of $90,000.
Still he knew he would never earn as much as the others.
"As early as during my first interview in 2005, I knew they despised me.
Because of my education, and also for my professional and personal development," Kerviel described the situation to the investigators.
But soon after Kerviel entered his career, the first big success followed.
Thanks to the Allianz shares he gained; during the London bombings he bet a half billion Euro that they would fall.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As Long as You Gain, We Let You
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his superiors are said to have known, or rather suspected the whole thing.
"As long as I was earning money for them, they pretended not to see."
But then, at the beginning of the year, a blow came.
In a single day, he lost 1 billion Euro.
He wanted to expunge the whole thing after the weekend in the middle of January.
When he came to the office on Monday, he was no longer employed by the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced it had lost 5 billion Euro because of him.
So how did they uncover him?
He became suspicious through his vacations.
"I took only four days out of the last year.
A broker who does not take vacations is a broker who does not want anybody to look into his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has chance to get 365 billion.
The ministers of the Czech Government, together with the representatives of the European Union, signed nine operational programs yesterday, from which the Czech Republic can acquire 14 billion Euro (approximately 365 billion Czech crowns) in the following years.
This is roughly half the total sum the Czech Republic can acquire from Brussels during the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion Czech crowns will move from seven operational programs into the regions.
Czech companies will be able to gain about 100 billion Czech crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation program.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will be directed into transportation.
The Transportation program is the biggest operational program, it represents almost 22 percent of the resources which the Czech Republic can obtain from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transportation Infrastructure, which will be managing a sum of 90.8 billion Czech crowns next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation program ought to serve the entrepreneurs and companies to gain the resources for innovational business.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, for the industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective methods of organization.
As for the actual extraction of money from the EU funds, the Czech Republic is thus far among the least successful within the newly accepted countries.
A 20-year sentence for the ex-President of Nicaragua has been upheld by the court.
The Nicaraguan court of appeal upheld the 20-year sentence for the ex-President of the country, Arnoldo Alemán, in which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud of up to $100 million (almost 1.8 billion Czech crowns)on Thursday.
However, he was later liberated and was under house arrest at his hacienda, not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997-2002 will go back behind bars, is not clear at the moment according to the Associated Press.
According to the chairperson of the court of appeal, Ileana Péréz, it will now be dependent on the custodial officials, whether they will let Aléman serve his sentence at home, or if he will go to prison.
The court proved four years ago that Aléman had regularly shifted government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were imaginary and the accounts were actually held by his relatives and closest adherents.
Some of the money ended up in a fund which Aléman established to finance his election campaigns in 2001.
So They've Approved Our Budget
That's it.
The state budget has been accepted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget built by this government and accepted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for this year was passed last year still with the support of the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), because it was prepared by minister Sobotka and CSSD could not afford for it to not be accepted.
In contrast to the animated debate before the vote of no-confidence in the government, nothing extreme has occurred this time.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this traditionally overlooked but most influential law easily.
It is a sort of paradox.
Each governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, like it or not.
The budget is a substantial part of politics, but it is covered by the struggle for power between the government and the opposition.
It is more widely appreciated by the media, that is why the media pay much more attention to it.
The politicians' quarrels are much more interesting for the public than straight numbers.
The state budgets of the past social democratic governments suffered from three maladies which 2008's budget is not able to resolve all at once:
First, there is the high portion of the expenditures mandatory by law, the so-called mandatory expenditures, including not only pensions, but also social benefits passed last year before the elections by the silent "alliance" of CSSD and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM).
Second, there is the deficit economy as a result of the first malady.
The third limit is the deficits in public financing, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and villages.
However, the state budget deficit is not the biggest risk.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb here is the deficit of the budgets of cities and villages.
Many mayors, in order to gain resources for their investments other than the money from taxes, fees, and bank loans, often mindlessly issued securities, with which they unreasonably incurred debt for the councils.
In the past years, they managed to pay the debts off by the mass sale of stocks of the power and distribution networks they acquired from the state during privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick just to the official and certifiable facts, we discover that:
Our economy has already been passing through the phase of growth for a few years, as is the rest of the world, about which CSSD keeps boasting.
This has been a unique opportunity for its governments to put public financing in order.
But instead they continued incurring debt for the state more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed the money much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a huge shame, which falls mainly upon the previous governments.
We are among the countries which are, measured globally, endangered by poverty to the least extent.
Therefore there is no need for any massive social programs, which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in the past years.
Though they managed to cancel a part of the absurd populistic expenditures passed this year before the elections, if the shift of the age limit for retirement and the revision of pensions does not take place soon, any politics in this country will virtually end, regardless of who is ruling then, it will be mere paperwork.
With a bit of exaggeration, we can say that the governing politicians will become white-collar workers mechanically distributing most of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits.
Therefore this year's budget cannot be revolutionary in any way, it can only set back the mandatory expenditures pushing away the normal expenditures.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally useless if the past governments had not lost as much as they could during the last ten years.
If we do not want to let the governing politicians become mere white-collar workers, we have to be patient and allow the not very strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can give over only as much as it can obtain on taxes and charges, peace for the preparation of other reform laws.
Only they will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Solve Crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, The European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis on financial markets together.
More than $100 billion will enter the monetary markets by means of public sales.
In public sales, banks bid on the interest rate for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the American Fed will send $40 billion into public sale and make 24 more available to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time after the September 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states settled on such a coordinated procedure aimed at preventing or decreasing the effects of a financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problems, i.e. the growing lack of free capital banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl from the counseling company Economic Outlook Group in the report for his clients.
"The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the probability of the recession in the U.S. from 65 percent to about 50 percent," added Baumohl in the report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to the non-repaid loans, especially in the U.S.
The analysts expect further billion-dollar losses.
"The central banks must be very afraid of what more can follow, if they decided in favor of such a procedure," said the main economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks worry that if the banks themselves have a difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers for more.
That will lower the consumption and send the American economics into a recession, with possible impact on the economic growth of the whole world.
The central banks made this decision after the failure to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, a London interbank rate, which is used for lending money on a wholesale market.
This meant that the banks still feared mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the U.S., Canada and Great Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another decrease in the interest rates," Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' step will help ward off the crisis, because it does not solve the basic problem, the real estate market drop in the U.S.
Klaus: Environmentalists' Debates are Unbelievable
Global climate changes will mostly harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has again commented on the problem of global warming.
The concluding UNO international conference on climate changes in Bali faces his critique now.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he said that the environmentalists' debates were unbelievable.
According to Mr. Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of government officials and nongovernmental organizations which cannot be accepted, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the reality.
"The debate there is absolutely unstructured, it is just a burst of words which are a substitute for the resolution of current problems," said Mr. Klaus.
The Czech president emphasized during the presentation of his book that its topic is very important for him, which is why he is so engaged in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book is also available in German translation, because, as he said, "I frequently encounter only caricatures of my opinions".
So now everybody interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Mr. Klaus mentioned that although he is no environmentalist, in his opinion he has enough qualifications to write such a book.
That is, he is an academic, able to observe and evaluate technical discourse, he is experienced in statistics and he is also an economist.
As the main conclusions of the book, he designated the theses that climates change constantly and their changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all the researchers on global warming, that the effects of the current changes are not too great and relevant and so they do not represent any threat and that the efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are useless, inefficient and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a man of experience with totalitarianism, he considers forcing unsubstantiated opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restraint of freedom, to be unacceptable.
To the questions from the attendees he replied that he was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against the militant environmentalism which does not take into account the relation between costs and benefits".
Mr. Klaus had talked on the same subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute in Vienna.
600 Thousand People Did Not Manage to Renew Driver's Licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not manage to renew their old driver's licenses, the validity of which will expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for the renewal so that the authorities could manage to issue the new license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the road without a valid license after New Year's Eve.
According to the authorities, it is mostly those who do not want to drive anymore who did not renew the license.
While villages report a sharp decline in interest in driver's license renewal, the authorities in the city are overloaded with applications and the interest in the license renewal has grown this week.
The municipal council handles about 2000 clients a day.
They spend about half an hour waiting in line.
Roughly 140,000 drivers have not renewed their driver's license yet in Prague.
The issue of a new license takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to apply for the issue in the reduced time limit of five days.
In that case, the driver pays five hundred crowns extra.
Motorists who do not manage the renewal of the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver's license will be threatened with a fine.
A person who breaks the law will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But the police can also settle the offense through a settlement.
In case of an administrative offense, the fine will climb to 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information the council could even fine someone who does not drive at all.
Reportedly, such an individual could have paid up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry earlier asked the authorities to be reasonable and issue a thousand-crown fine at the most.
However, according to Ministry of Transport speaker Karel Hanzelka, nobody will be threatened with ten-thousand-crown fines.
According to him, a driver's license is a document which the people should be allowed to decide whether they want or not.
It is not an identity card which everybody must keep validated.
Those who do not want to drive anymore should give the license up.
It is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or send it by registered post.
By the end of the year, the validity of the licenses issued during 1964-1993 will have expired.
However, motorists must also subsequently renew other types of driver's licenses.
People with driver's licenses from 1994-2000 have three more years for the renewal.
The validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this concerns roughly 2.6 million other documents.
Court Reduces Sentences for Detectives Affiliated with Berdych
Ex-police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal conspiracy with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years, respectively.
It was decided definitively by the High Court in Prague, which thus reduced their sentences by one and two years, respectively.
The original sentence facing the detectives of the Prague Organized Crime Subdivision was 14 and 12 years, respectively.
It is not possible to appeal today's decision, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Though Berdych is charged in this case as well, he is still waiting for the verdict in the first instance.
Nevertheless, he has already been given sentences in other trials totaling more than 16 years.
He cannot get any more.
In January, the regional court found 19 people guilty, above all of the participation in felonies, the High Court was dissolving the appeals of 16 of them today.
Most of those charged refuted the indictment from the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it is a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Regional Senate, the members of the police, after making an arrangement with Berdych, gave the information from the police sources to the criminals, covered up the individual felonies and helped the members of the gang to elude their sentences.
In exchange, the gang surrendered 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment deals with the crimes of the gang from 1999-2001.
Namely, these were thefts whose victims often suffered serious physical injuries, but also the abuse of power and possession of illegal weapons.
The police have discovered illegally held arms, steel bullets, a laser gunsight or an automatic rifle in house searches.
According to the indictment, the gang made tens of millions of crowns in the thefts.
Except for the nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have lawfully convicted Berdych and a number of other people of other thefts.
Other men surrounding Berdych are still testifying in front of the court in a different trial, but some of the cases have not come to the trial yet.
The trial has thus far avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, currently in an Irish jail, where they await the decision regarding their version to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
An Account of the Baby Switch: 12 million
The lawyer for the aggrieved families, Igor Veleba, is requesting 12 million Czech crowns in compensation for the switch of the babies in a maternity clinic in the Třebíč hospital, plus legal expenses.
Three million for each of the mothers, two for each father and a million for each child.
The hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
The hospital's attorney, Ondřej Dostál, therefore radically disapproves of Veleba's proposition.
"We reject such a claim, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"To be able to define our position to the counter-motion, we need the expert opinion the opposing side has had made.
We will find out if it has any informative value at all.
Still, we stick to our opinion that it is going to be in hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the sum should range from 100,000 to 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family demanded a million crowns for each month they were not with their biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert opinion which the Motol University Hospital in Prague had elaborated for him as a basis for the negotiations.
According to the advisors in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children have suffered psychological injury and stress of various degrees and intensity.
The stressful situation was better endured by the men, though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies.
On the other hand, the women are coping worse with the urgency of the trauma experienced and of what is happening right now, Veleba summed up.
Veronika and Nikola were switched by the nurses in the Třebíč maternity clinic on December 9 of the last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks to Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
Vysočina county supervisor Miloš Vystrčil gave 100,000 CZK to each of the families as compensation for the expenditures that ensued from the mistake by the Třebíč hospital, run by the county.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured for the liability for damages by law.
In case of error, they have to dig into the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they can seek help from the founder.
By now the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, with the sums calculated according to the tables in six digit numbers, exceptionally in seven digit numbers, in Czech crowns.
Polívka Loses Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka has lost the case of the Wallachian Kingdom brand name.
According to an Ostrava Regional Court judge, he admittedly was the first to use the appellation the Wallachian king, but the project was developed through the long-term efforts of the team surrounding Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor.
Mr. Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, the case has probably not reached its end and his client will appeal.
"The quarrel consists in the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team sponge off of Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, if you say the Wallachian Kingdom, everybody recalls the actor and comedian.
Mr. Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"Almost ten years of hard work are behind us.
Of raising money and devising the projects," he said.
According to him the grounds for the quarrel is the money.
"After some years, they realized that the project was successful and that he could profit from it.
They want to sponge off of our labor," he added.
A Lucrative Business
According to the court, Polívka used the appellation "the Wallachian king" for the first time in his TV show.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Nevertheless, at the time it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
Several years later, Mr. Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an originally prank act, a business and a lucrative enterprise have evolved, which Harabiš then extended by establishing the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed with the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts on visits to his farm and theater performances to their holders.
Who will ascend to the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš only used the bare idea which Polívka made public in the circus for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," said the judge.
But she added that the heart of the project was Harabiš and his team, which has devoted itself to it so intensely.
The collaboration of currently quarreling parties continued until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation in Vsetín for Polívka.
From then on, quarrels begin to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the dethronement of "the king Boleslav I elected forever and ever".
On the instigation of Harabiš, the leading role in the kingdom was then taken over by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen mother.
In 2002 Polívka brought a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court overruled today.
Harabiš's planned joust for the throne and a half of the princess should shed light on the quarrel.
A new king should arise from the joust.
He did not want to disclose any details or the schedule yet.
"We do not want to rush things.
It should be something like the King's ride in the Slovácko region.
The king should be elected for a definite time span.
Even Mr. Polívka can sign up," added Harabiš.
The Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Melting Prejudices
To tell the truth, I have never rooted for Peugeot 206 too much.
Its handling characteristics have not been anything special, the quality of gear control, driving control and construction could occasionally have been labeled as mediocre.
But now there is its successor, the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is far better.
And the station wagon called SW goes even a step further and I cannot help but to give it another thought.
When I was testing the classical Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained for example about the headroom in the back seat.
Here the complaints are over, because the station wagon's body means that not even two-meter tall giants will suffer in this respect.
At a Glance
I will pass through the interior quickly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
We have quite an excellent design here, where the only critique I have is the meager central tunnel.
I would appreciate some more designer inventiveness here, as the car itself looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the times when we could have complained about short seats or seat backs are truly behind us.
Also, the lateral seat support has improved markedly in comparison with the 206 model.
Considering the space, we can feel the build-up in the car body dimensions as well.
In the station, then, the already mentioned lack of headroom disappears.
Suitcases into the Trunk
So the main thing about this car is its trunk.
I must evaluate it as very well accessible (thanks also to the hinged quarter window) and fairly spacious.
The blind spots are equipped with retaining elastics, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't block space, it can be dilated and yet it holds even heavier objects.
But let us pause to observe the volume.
According to the tables it is in 428 l the basic arrangement, which, compared to its competitors, is rather average.
But not in comparison with the best selling car of this class in Bohemia - the Skoda Fabia Station Wagon.
If we compare the 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá Boleslav products, we will see that the Peugeot lags highly noticeable 52 liters behind.
For vacations in foreign countries or with a baby-carriage load, this number is almost critical.
Though if I were to accent the positive points, I would have to mention the absolutely flat surface when turning down the seat backs in the second row or the very low threshold.
120 Horses in Four Rows
The tested wagon was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with 1.6 l capacity and 88kW power.
And to tell the truth, this is how a 1600 which powers a family hatchback should look.
It is quiet, it has low expenditure, and above all it really moves.
If I compare it to the Skoda equivalent, which sometimes makes you feel like it has a rag stuck in the exhaust, I cannot help but be delighted.
The Hint is in the Price
The car's price is not cheap.
Nevertheless, we shall bear in mind that we have tested a fairly equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a 1.6 petrol engine of 329,900 Czech crowns is not that bad.
Our assembly costs a minimum of 410,900, which is pretty much already.
The tested equipment Premium will include equipment worth some 80, 000 Czech crowns more.
But besides, we had the head airbags, the automatic air-condition, the automatic screen-wiper activation, the electric rear-window control...
The car simply costs 531,900 Czech crowns all in all.
This is quite a bit, but if you consider the the additional equipment of Fabia, you will get a very similar number.
So there's nothing else to do but to choose based on the brand-name.
Integration of Slovak Pupils in British Schools Not Progressing
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is rising, making the local residents fear further development of the local education system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is encountering a number of impediments at present.
British schools register even cases when quarrels between the immigrants and the children of the original population turn into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is exemplified well by the situation in northern Kent, where quarrels between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and fights between the pupils have extended to the relations between their parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who beat a ten-year-old pupil with an iron cane.
In her own defense, the offender claims that the boy had insulted her with racial slurs.
The police also had to intervene following an attack by two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls reportedly called the man racist comments and threw stones at him.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit down onto us.
When I asked him to stop it, he pelted us with apples and pears and than he showed up his nude bottom," a mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant accident for The Times.
The complaints come from both sides.
One of the local residents even classified the quarrels with Eastern European immigrants as a fight for survival.
The above mentioned cases indicate that the mood between the locals and the immigrants at British schools is beginning to be strained.
There are 70 thousand Slovaks registered in Britain who moved there for work.
Roughly 30 thousand Slovak pupils, then, attend British schools.
Cuba the Most Beautiful Island of the Caribbean
For its visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacations, it can happen if you make the right choice.
Golden and lily-white beaches, high waves or a sea calm as a pond.
Palm trees and the full board with waiters offering pizza, ice-cream or potent shakes on the beach.
Kite-surfing, golf and roulette.
You will find a full and even richer list of all this on the islands in the Caribbean Sea.
But there is just one island where you find much more, and that island is Cuba, the biggest and most beautiful of the West Indies.
Under the reign of Spaniards, Cuba was the stronghold of their American conquest.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a man's eye had ever seen.
Havana became a storage and transfer center for the treasures the Spaniards had stolen in America and transferred to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 1920s.
Its building was initiated by one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because all that was illegal in the U.S. (especially during the prohibition) was welcome and supported in Cuba, drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rises were built in Havana, and the cars which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s drove on the wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and he had a yacht in Cojímar.
The movie stars and politicians from all over America were leaving their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
Even you can leave your autograph on the walls in the Havana Bodeguita.
They will mix a shake according to your wishes in the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around Havana ever since, because the once imported Zhiguli and Fiat vehicles have decayed in the salty and damp weather.
Though Havana, particularly its oldest part, is significantly squalid, nowhere else in the surroundings is there such a great number of fabulous colonial sights.
Other places have also been transformed into beauty, e.g. Trinidad.
With respect to the fact that tourism brings in badly needed money, its development has the green light.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but in particular in Varadero, on the Holguín coast and on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more rarity which is unique in the world, of special value to train lovers.
Sugar cane from the vast plantations was transported to the sugar mills on narrow rails by a small steam locomotive and motor trains.
Their wagon stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and so you can see functional trains there whose contemporaries elsewhere are now only in museums.
Where to go?
Most visitors to Cuba will not miss the best known spots.
And so there is no need to get into much detail about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to mention that there is a museum in the Hemingway homestead mentioned above and those who like this author should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley The Viňales Valley in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque spots in Cuba.
Lush vegetation grows out of the limestone bedrock.
Mogotes, limestone round-topped mountains and rocks rise up steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in the cavities, thanks to which even the dilapidated rocks are covered with thick overgrowth.
The valley is a place where probably the extra-best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can encounter its final shape if you visit one of the Havana factories for cigar making.
The fact that the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed there may also be of interest to some.
Trinidad
An ancient city which was established shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Fame and fortune were brought there with the slave and sugar trades.
Fortune transformed into beauty and the imposing architecture of the small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, deeply influenced by the later French colonists, has not changed much during four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is a place so remote that even as late as in the 1950s there was still no road to connect the area to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped it remain apart from it.
Nothing was being built there, therefore nothing was being torn down either, everybody was glad to have a roof over their head.
If you have more time for Trinidad than just one afternoon, other interesting places in the neighborhood are worth seeing as well, like the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugarmill Valley.
In the evening, it is appropriate go to Casa de la Música, which becomes full of life at nightfall and the music abates there at dawn.
Baracoa
A tiny town easternmost end of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful one on the island.
This opinion is certainly influenced by the road leading there itself.
Both roads leading there from Guantanámo must pass through high and rugged mountains and they go through natural surroundings nearly untouched by human activity.
Thanks to its unviolated nature, the eastern cape of Cuba has been placed by UNESCO onto the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolate there, they have a Columbus cross in a church (which was actually created about one hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and what today is the hotel El Castillo stands, you can see several mesas, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
You can fill many pages writing about it all: the coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santería, and African religions, which are professed by the descendants of former slaves.
But, as the veritable saying goes, better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan Passive, Americans Say
According to the U.S., the low number of soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment is influencing the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the following years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding according to the original concept, the representatives of the countries which have posted units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing reluctance of the Taliban movement, eight participant states will also discuss other plans and the coordination of the allies today.
Whereas the U.S. ordered the NATO units through the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to increase activity this week, Great Britain sees the priority in the reinforcement of the Afghan government authority and the intensification of developmental aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but armed forces can only be part of the solution.
The other is to let the inhabitants begin further expansion of the economy and security themselves," the British Secretary of Defence Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety Percent
According to data from the U.S. Army, the activity of the Afghan rebels is the greatest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose 27 percent compared with last year, as much as 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
The NATO countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of whom are in the southern territory.
But according to the U.S., the allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
They are specifically asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts on Afghan unit training.
"We will have to think hard about the concrete goals for the coming era and the ways to reach them," said Gates.
The Secretary General of NATO Jaap de Hoop spoke today with a similar intent.
"I am not happy about what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is little," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Is Passive
There are some quarrels among the countries involved over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for passivity.
"Germans have rather a numerous representation in Afghanistan.
Yet they are stationed in areas of minimum violence and the combat requirements on them are not as high as those on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates.
The British tabloid The Sun labeled German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The Afghan Layabouts Disclosed: Germans Play As Our Boys Fight," wrote The Sun in material accompanied by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild fought back and printed a photo of a British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National Debt to Vault to a Trillion in 2009
There is national debt of more than 84 000 crowns for each Czech.
The total debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
But at the beginning of December the ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved development of use of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's national debt rose by the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
It has risen by 40.2 billion crowns in the nine months of this year.
Though it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns since June.
This is the way in which the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October today.
A debt of more than 84,000 crowns for each Czech.
During all of last year, the state incurred debts of more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now it appears that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we should not break the trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year the debt should range from 900 billion to a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHned.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it in a similar way: "We can get over the trillion limit in the course of the year 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget, which we do not know yet.
If the situation in the political arena were to change, the politicians would be willing to spare more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But we do not predict such a change," he said.
Debts Are Growing
The national debt consists of the debts of the central government and emerges above all due to the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct loans or for example by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The foreign debt of the state has risen 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns by the end of September and has fallen 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average due date of the national debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The absolute interim debt for the first to third quarter rose 13 percent, which is quite a lot compared to the state of the economy.
What is interesting is that the growth is generated especially through bonds, where the growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that we will have something to trade when the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than Expected
It follows from the strategy of national debt financing and control for 2007 that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
But at the beginning of December, the ministry decreased the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to improved development of the use of the state budget.
The sum consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach 76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns this year.
It also includes the planned maximal resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the Czech Consolidation Agency, a ten billion reserve for pension pay-outs, financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the installment payment of the loans from the European Investment bank totaling 1.8 billion crowns.
Today, she came before Khartoum court for having named a teddy bear
The English teacher tried in Sudan for offending Islam has been sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment and to expulsion by Khartoum court on Thursday night, explained her lawyer.
The English teacher has been accused of allowing her pupils aged between 6 and 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear, when every representation of the Islam's prophet is banned.
She was liable to lashes punishment.
This 54-year-old English teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, has been arrested last Sunday at her home, with the accuse both of threatenig Islam and sedition, according to the article no. 125 of the Sudanese criminal code, following many complaints of the children's parents to the Sudan's Ministry Of Education.
In fact, the case goes back to the month of September, when the school teacher asked her pupils, aged between 6 and 7, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
«Eight names came out from the children's mouth, among those Hassan, Abdullah and Muhammad», explains the school headmaster Robert Boulos.
At the end, after the class'vote, 20 children out of 23 have choosen Muhammad as their favourite name.
Surely, Muhammad is the name of the Muslim prophet, but first of all it's a very common name in Sudan.
Then, the children created a book for the class with the bear's picture followed by the legend «My name is Muhammad».
The bear itself didn't wear any label with that name, but the problem lies in the prophet's represantation, considered as an offense to Islam.
A Muslim collegue of Gillian Gibbons, who's a teacher in the same school in Sudan, has highlighted that he knew her well and that she would have never done anything offensive for any faith, «I'm just sorry she has asked her pupils to vote for a name», according to him, it's simply an «innocent mistake».
It's an opinion shared with many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as «very attentive towards her pupils» and «a person who never talks about religion within the class».
Moreover, it should be reminded that Muhammad is the second most common name in Great Britain, which is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name, which is often choosen by Muslim families, is one way of honouring the prophete (it is often given to the family's firstborn).
But which rules regulate the use of that name?
For istance, is it possible to give it to a toy?
Certainly, it's a matter of interpretation.
They haven't reached any accord on the province's future statute on Wednesday, during the last negotiations' session in Vienna.
At the end, the failure.
Serbians and Kosovo's Albanians completed on Wednesday morning in Baden, in Austria, the sixth and last session of negotiations without managing in overcoming their differences on the futur statute of the separatist province.
«It is regrettable that the parties haven't been able to reach an accord on the statute», declared the european mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that the peace in the region was «at stake», his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
«For the time being, violence is not forseen but we're entering a very difficult period», he has added, highlighting the «existence of important tensions».
End of the mediation on 10th december.
Troika mediators, which gathers the Europian Union, USA and Russia, will go for the last time to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province populated 90% by Albanian-speaking people will probably be clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will have submitted their report to the UN Security Council, by the 10th December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the United Nations, last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on the 10th December.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence to Kosovo, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
«Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution», said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of United Nations administration in Kosovo, Westerners believed that independence under supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council won't be in its favour.
Belgrade is insisting on an increased autonomy.
«Unfortunately, no agreement was reached», announced the president of the self-rule authority in Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden's hotel where these "last chance" negotiations were taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the ex-commander of Kosovo rebels and future prime minister of the province, expressed its regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade «belonged to a past which led to murders and deportations».
«Domino effect»
The Serbian President Boris Tadic suggested that a compromise was still possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence for the province.
Belgrade fears a «domino effect» in a fragile region, weakened by the indipendence wars of the 1990s.
«For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.»
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that every decision should be up to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto.
«Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word»
«There's just one acceptable solution for Serbia within the Security Council», declared the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
«Those negotiations have been going on for two years.
«They should end as they began: within the Security Council.»
Fatmir Sedjiu answered the journalists that «Kosovo's Parliament will have the last word on the statute», adding that every unilateral declaration of independence coming from Albanian-speaking people would be done by consulting the Westerners.
Bush snatches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
The president George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, in Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally reached their accord on a common declaration.
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas agreed to begin immediate negotiations for finding a final settlement of the 60-year-old contention between their two people.
In the presence of the two men, Bush has promised to do everything to help them concluding a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to demolish "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel has to stop its settlement activities, declared Bush, reminding both parties their obligations towards the peace "roadmap" they've accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim at "the conclusion of a peace treaty solving every outstanding issue, without any exception, central issues included".
This term covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the contentious between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in the current State of Israel during the conflict of 1948.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted on future "global and in-depth" negotiations which will be based on a regulation, mentioning among others "Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the settlements, the water and the security".
At his turn to speak, Olmert committed himself to future "direct and continuous" negotiations and to make an effort to end them in 2008.
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for implementing his "vision of two coexisting states" of Israel and Palestine.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it secured a commitment from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Charged by all Arabic conutries, Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its own territories occupied during the 1967's war, East-Jerusalem included.
Annapolis marks "a crossroad in the Middle-East history, particularly because it faces the conflict's roots and its central aspects", Prince Saud says in his interview with an Arabic newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police is not responsible.
What did precisely happen on Sunday?
As always happens in this kind of situations, official versions and rumors are the opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the inquiry runned by the General Ispection of the National Police (IGNP), a police car was moving around on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, Louise-Michel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
«There was no emergency, they were on patrol and the car was circulating at 40-50 km / h, without flashing lights», explained a policeman.
A green Kawazaki motorbike, «not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on public roads» (read above), driven by two guys without helmets, was travelling «at great speed».
«It struck the police car on the left, failing to give way to its right», stated a policeman.
The results of the alcohol test were negative on the motorbike occupants.
The state of the car (the front of the car broked, the windsceer crushed, the bumper ripped) testifies the violence of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Pontoise Republic prosecutor, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced she had entrusted an investigation to the IGNP for «manslaughter and non-assistance to people in danger».
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor states that the inquiry of the IGPN, at this stage, discarded the police's responsability.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses of the accident, questioned on Sunday evening, confirmed «the police's version, that is the mini-motorbike arrived quite quickly on their left».
Yesterday, some kind of groove, maybe caused by the toeclip's rubbing, showed that the two vehicles got stuck until the car braked.
Both vehicles have been confiscated and will be passed under technical expertise.
An autopsy on the two victimes'bodies was conducted yesterday.
What did happen immediately after?
Yesterday, rumours have quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had soon left the place, without helping the two people.
According to that point, the IGNP, remaining cautious, would reject «any serious mistake».
«It's one of the most difficult aspects of the inquiry, which requires more investigations, towards which it's necessary to be very cautious», stated a policeman.
"Libération" has met one eyewitness among those who have seen the accident.
One of his window looked precisely onto the scene.
«We got off immediately, me and my cousine who is a nurse at the hospital, trying to revive them, explique the witness.
There was nothing left to do».
Then, he saw «a policeman completely shocked, limping.
Two other people tried to revive them, a fourth person was talking on the phone».
Because of the increasing tension surrounding the scene and, it seems, the victims' hopeless fate,the policemen have been driven away by some collegues who arrived on the scene.
Always according to this witness, the emergency service arrived «about twenty minutes after the police departure».
They've also tried a cardiac massage, without any result.
«I won't let anyone say that the police didn't help them.
The emergency service did attend.
The fire brigade came immediately.
Everything has been done trying to help them.», emphasized in her turn the prosecutor.
The tension increases in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the instauration of the state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the town of Lahore, in the East of the country, about 2.000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken within the state of emergency were wounded by the tear gas cannistes used by the police, explained some witnesses.
They replied by throwing stones, injuring some policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were questioned.
Similar situations in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where some policemen have beaten and injured some lawyers.
Many people were questioned.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the bar of the Supreme Court pulled a strike and announced future demonstrations, after a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights militants and lawyers during the week-end.
The roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning for avoiding the meeting.
Other demonstrations took place in Multan (in the centre) and in Peshawar (in the North-West).
The lawyers' movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties gathered in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who declared themselves against the state of emergency and wastes to those who swore an oath in front of Musharraf".
"Musharraf breaks his promise"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned with emergency measures which were announced on Saturday evening.
In the next days, it was expected to take a decision on the legality of president Musharraf's re-election, which took place the 6th October.
The Court president, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been ousted and replaced.
''All that we are attending is illegal, anticonstitutional and against the measures of the Supreme Court'', declared the magistrate to News newspaper.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf of becoming a civil president is broken with the announcement of the state of emergency, declared on Monday the Information minister Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave the army by the 15th November, with the expiration of his first presidential mandate.
Moreover, the Information minister confirmed that the elections of January could be deferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied those rumours accoeding to which president Musharraf would have been under house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies is unexpected.
This estimate takes into consideration the unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as the unplanned births.
Nowadays, more than one pregnancy out of three (36 %) is still unplanned, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the Neuwirth law, which legailized the contraception in France, was voted.
This estimate takes into consideration the unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as the unplanned births.
Different contraceptives, such as the pill or the coil, have a failure rate which is still between 5% and 6%, estimated the Ined.
In spite of that, the legalization of the contraception leaded to a better «fertility control», expliques the Institute according to which the rate of the pill's use among women between 20 and 44 years old has nowadays risen to 60 %, against 5 % in 1970.
Finally, nowadays eight births out of ten would be well planned.
One couple out of five would even plan the birth's month, choosing when possible the springtime, considered the best period for having a child.
Extraordinary rapair on the space station
The astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates of the Interntional Space Station (ISS) spent more than seven hours working in space, repairing a mangled solar array, indispensable to continue the scientific activities of the station.
A dangerous spacewalk which set a record in its lenght, its distance from habitable module, its rapidity and in the «repairing» tools used by the astronauts.
The problem came out on Tuesday, when the astronauts pulled the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a big cylindrical piece charged of holding both European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see figure).
This module is a sort of deck landing for the modules-laboratories.
But it is necessary to provide them with elecrticity.
In order to produce electricity, then, the second task of the crew was to move a 17,5 tons module for solar arrays, which was already in the ISS.
After having moved the module, the crew started using its solar arrays, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
It was there that a solar array, bending like an accordion, was mangled by a rope.
In order to avoid further damages, the array was stopped from bending.
The astronauts, whose spacewalk's aim was to check the Discovery shuttle and repair another solar array with a faulty rotation system, had to repair the damaged one too.
And Scott Parazynski was choosen for the stitching, on the end of the 58-foot robot arm that was added up for the rapair.
He is one of the best NASA spacewalker.
He's tall, strong, very capable, he has a great chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, with a past medical carriere, he was charged of « operate » on that « wounded » solar array.
After having examined the damages, he dissected the wrong rope and fixed a sort of « splint » on the mangled area.
He has been helped by another spacewalker who stayed next to him, while his crew and its leader Peggy Whitson was helping him from the inside.
The tool he used, a tiny hockey stick wrapped in insulator in order to avoid electrocution on the solar arrays producing hundreds of volts, was planned and created in the space station.
At the end of the operation, before checking his tools and coming back to the station, Scott Parazynski waited for the solar array to be completely unfolded.
Yesterday, in the afternoon, the astronautes had a half day of rest, while seven astronautes are today ready to leave on the Discovery shuttle, coming back to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS shares approved in the Stock Exchange
At present, EADS shares are definitely in decline in Paris Stock Exchange, since the aeronautic and defence company has announced its willing to spend an amount between 1,2 and 1,4 milliards euros for facing the A400M's delay.
EADS is losing 4% (at 21.96 euros) in Paris Stock Exchange.
The group had to re-examine its forecasts for the 2007 operative result since the delay caused by the slow developement progression of the A400M engine, which affects the inauguration flight of the plane.
The cost for overcoming the delay in the delivery of this aircraft, announced in October, is "around 1,2 and 1,4 milliards euros, of which more than 1 milliard goes for the Airbus", announced EADS, the European global leader in aerospace.
Because of these charges, EADS will have to annouce new EBIT targets for 2007, on the occasion of next Thursday's presentation of its quarterly results, added without any further information about prices.
Moreover, the group states that the estimation of the new charges is consistent with the six-months delay.
It should be reminded that EADS operative result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the charges associated with the delay of another programme, the one of A380 shareholder.
At the beginning, the group expected to deliver the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The statu quo choice
There won't be any suspense at Sunday exit poll: Russians are opting overwhelmingly for the party of the President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming in this way their aim to stability, event to the authoritarianism, after an incisive campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, the Russian president Vladimir Putin appeals to his voters with TV message on the public networks, which has already been registered but whose content rest kept in secret.
He acts as leading candidate of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which is expected an overwhelming triumph.
Yesterday, welcoming the foreign ambassadors, the President did not betray anything, bringing just a further charge against the West, accused of interference - his favourite subject during the campaign.
« We know the price of a true democracy and we are expecting fair, absolutely clear and open elections, without any obstacles.», he added.
According to the opposition, this result seems too far.
It denounces an under pressure campaign.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that «there has never been so dirty elections, even in Eltsin times».
After the repression of the last week-end demonstrations, it's still forbidden to visit the ex world champion of flop, Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days'imprisonment for illegal demonstration, said his lawyer.
« Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality. »
Behind those legislative elections without any suspense, there are two wider questions:
- Who will be Putin's successor?
The official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of the elections, on the 2nd March 2008; the candidates have time until the 23rd December to come forward.
Elected for the first time in 2000 and for a second time in 2004, Vladimir Putin can not afford a third mandate.
At the present, there isn't any emerging successor.
- Which role is Putin going to play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parlamentary majority and of the most powerful party United Russia, which is going to choose both the government and the president?
Whatever the case may be, at the legislative elections, as well as at the presidential ones, the outgoing party will triumph.
It is a tradition.
« Russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel the owners of their destiny», considers the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada indipendent centre.
Nikolaï Kopossov, a historian of the St. Petersburg State University, goes farther: the civil society in this Christianized country was five centuries late than in Europe; the well-known community attitude postponed the birth of individualism.
After the liberal reformes of the 1990s, « Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, considering that the new paternalism wasn't followed by a period of terror but by economic affluence », states Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Russians are "voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility » that they had briefly shown after the collapse of the URSS.
«What's to be considered then?»
The phenomenon affects every social class, business included.
And the administrative élite aims to keep the statu quo: 65 governors (out of 85 laeders of Russian regions) are heading the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonym of chaos, as it happened in the 1990s.
The public opinion prefers the stability.
It is the reason for which Russians won't vote for extremists.
Here are Tamara Tcherednitchenko conclusions, 54-year-old professor: «What's to be considered then?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why changing them? »
The weight of the past
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which explain the fate ot 17,5 millions victimes of Hitler dictatorship, can be consulted.
The 47 millions documents gathered in the archives, arranged on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were until now exclusively available for «humanitarian» aims, therefore individually, by request of an ancient victim or by people entitled to.
The eleven states charged with their administration -among them Germany, France, Israel and the United States- agreed on May 2006 in making them available for research workers and historians.
Completed the ratification process of the agreement, the archives are available since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The historians access to Bad Arolsen archives will particularly enable « researches on the prisoners' movings, the camps' population and the health of the forced laborers », explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives kept by the International Council of Croix-Rouge (CICR).
Up to now, many countries, among which Germany, opposed the public availability of these private documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the homosexuality or the mental handicap of some victims of the deportation.
The registers of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered at the end of the war for a practical aim: finding the deported people or people subjected to forced labour and, eventually, demonstrate their internment, in order to let them getting their compensation.
Nowadays, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees still receive tens of thousands individual requests.
However, for some people of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen has a limited interest.
« There is nothing new to learn from these documents », declared in 2006 the Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the research centre on anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität of Berlin.

UMP and NC refuse to examin PS's proposals on the purchaising power
UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss some sections of the socialist bill on the purchaising power, that means they refused the text.
Conceived in a socialist setting (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the TIPP re-introduction, a cheque-transport or the rental charges control.

The PS leader, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will represent the integrality of his proposals by moving an amendment to the financial bill which will be examined by the Commission the next week.

« For our company, it's an honour to collaborate with someone who has even inspired the current festival mouvement in America», confessed Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.

Montréal faces Terminator
It is not easy for Montréal to attract Holliwood movies when the rejector is Terminator...
This seduction's mission is part of the delegate's functions.
A politically difficult task because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the «runaway productions».
Is it difficult to play the role of the «Governor»?
«You need to be careful, it's the industry which decides where to go.
If it finds favourable conditions in Montréal, it will go there.
Our role, is to offer the best conditions», he says.
The festivals race
Currently, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote our cinema.
The Oscars race has started.
All festivals of the West Coast, taking place in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give prominence to them and make sure to fix a meeting with all directors.
Days of Darkness had a good presentation at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.ù
It will be introduced at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be introduced at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival, in November.
Quebec has also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally in the stock market? The experts are divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
With less than five weeks to the closing of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping in the traditional year-end rally.
Nevertheless, this year the experts do not clearly know if this will happen.
Banif thinks that "from a statistical point of view, December usually has a positive effect on the stock market.
Nevertheless, it's not opportune to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, even more so in the present context, where uncertainties are visible in the markets, at least in the short term".
Although they aren't in favour of a stock-market run in the last weeks of the year, the experts point to "the stock market, which is maintained by liquidity, arranged to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed rent, affected by the fled-effect towards quality shares as much in the long term as in the short one".
For that, they think that stock-market will have a rather lateral behaviour, non-free of volatility "so we don't know the impact of the Fed's probability reduction types, for the high level of crude oil and the stimulating danger of the inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to take risks, thinking that there will be a rally.
"It is not a pleasing thing", assures the expert.
Ibex has lost nearly 4% from the maximum reached on November 8th, when the index closed at 15945.7 points.
Even so, not all the experts share this negative viewpoint.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearer to 16000 points thanks to portfolio reconstruction and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be different this year, since he thinks that rally will occur during the second week of December, after the Constitution holiday.
The analyst does not consider that volatility is going to affect the market trend.
On the other hand, Federico Olucha, Inversis Bank analyst, thinks that we are near to technical levels and "therefore, as far as the consequences of the crisis on the credit market, we could see a rebound in the index that could be impelled depending on the news arriving from the U.S.A.".
The analyst trusts that this will be positive.
The analysts agree to choose the shares that will be the ones in charge for taking Ithebex towards new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, affirms that "this year it's the turn for the great stocks".
The expert would include in the portfolio both: great banks and some constructors "because when the date arrives, the electrical sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Bank assures that the ascents will come from the banking and industrial sector.
The constructors also will be able to benefit from this rally, in case it happens.
"ACS takes several months recuperating, and we hope that other construction companies like Ferrovial and FCC go the same way", explains the expert.
The consumer's cycle will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in the sales figures during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert thinks that the technological sales also will do very well although in this case there is not much presence in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only on two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The authentic year-end rally took place in the 2003 exercise where stock markets left the crisis caused by the technological bubble.
This year, where Ibex 35 recovered 28,17%, December registered a growth of 6,68%.
We're going to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (at the moment Ibex has risen 8,36% from January) and whether there will be a year-end rally.
Popular will open its 200 offices for 12 hours daily from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew a large part of their offices.
In total 200, located in the most commercial zones of Spain.
These branches will operate under the mark Popular Max and represent a big change for the bank.
This is also true for the rest of the Spanish banks, since this is the first group to decide to bet on an all-day aperture for their offices, until 20.30 in the evening, and open on Saturdays from 1000 to 2030 hours.
Another group that has also reiterated in several occasions that it wanted to extend the opening times of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to make the move.
While, it's near to closing an agreement with the unions who insist on the closure of 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening late, although not to the public.
Results from Popular's experience will be decisive for other banks to follow the initiative, depending on commercial hours.
Indeed this is the objective that Popular is chasing with this project.
To catch the particular clients that circulate in these zones to make their purchases, to SMEs, the independent and commercial sales of the chosen streets to open.
The bank needs to have these 200 offices open in all Spain within 18 months, since they are not building new offices but remodelling existing ones.
For that, the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial zones, adapting them to the clients profile of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the opening times is accompanied by a different space concept of the branch and a new design with more luminous colours.
The manager of the commercial bank Angel Creek assures that this reconstruction does not require a great investment, although an increase in personnel is required since one needs to go from about six employees at the premises to eight or nine.
The offices, that will even have meeting rooms for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
One positive experience for the group.
Popular has tested its initiative on three offices in Madrid.
And it has been a positive experience, according to Ángel Rivero's explanation.
Branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Via streets of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems with success according to Rivero.
Today Popular accounts for 2500 branches.
And another 60 operate through the Mundocredit trademark, specifically for immigrants, which have increased opening times, and even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax offices they don't replicate the BBVA model, where several of their offices count on a great variety of non financial products for their commerce.
"We don't want to compete with our clients", says Rivero.
At present, they have agreed with Telefonica to sell cell phones, with personnel outside the bank.
For the first time Telecinco doubles its stock market value when compared to its rival Antenna 3
"We've done it".
With that phrase Paolo Vasile, executive advisor of Telecinco, expressed yesterday his satisfaction at market closure, when it stated that it had reached a value of double that of its rival, Antenna 3.
Only one aspect dimmed its joy: "It hurts me, not because we have grown more but because we have lowered less", he affirmed.
Even so, he insisted that in a weak market, "we have fallen less".
Telecinco closed the day with an advance of 2,54% yesterday.
That gain puts the loss we suffered for the year at 15,66%.
The value of the company's shares, controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (another 13%), at the stock market reached therefore the 4,488.88 million Euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
It's rival, Antenna 3, that yielded 1.52% and which yesterday accumulated a slope of 40.5% from January, is valued at half that, 2,193.46 million.
Shares of other quoted communication companies rise; to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2518.53 million for Prisa (publisher of Five Days) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, "we are speaking of two similar companies" and hence the comparison with Antenna 3.
"The fact is how much are we able to operate within the same market, at what cost, and how we can profit in terms of customers".
Telecinco announced last week that it anticipates this year to become the first TV chain in surpassing the 1,000 million gross advertising income, according to Giuseppe Tringali, delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the publicity of the group.
If the published data is true, the television network has registered this year an increase of 3,6% in publicity revenue with respect to the 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise.
On the other hand, the net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (reaching 734.4 million) whereas the net income of the television grew by 0.7% (630,4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts point to as indicative of the evolution in Telecinco in the stock market is elevated payout that has been maintained until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alexander Echevarría distributed the 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too soon to make a decision, this ratio may change after purchasing 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent company Mediaset.
"Officially, we are committed to pay out a of minimum 50%, although we have always declared more.
This year, I hope that we are able to leave our shareholders, to whom we have already given good value with 33% of Endemol", satisfied.
According to the analysts, the market shows signs of fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco for 2008 to 4%, and 2009 to 7%.
It happens, they explain, beacuse of the cut in the anticipated growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same company has lowered the forecasted profit of Antenna 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.
Three views
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both shares based primarily on its high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: Viewed Telecinco as better (to accumulate) than Antenna 3 (to keep) for the 'multiples attractive' and business increase.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to weigh carefully both cases for "similar threats" (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of Mifid that took place on November 1st
Alongside its parliamentary proceedings, that ended today with the partial voting of the Congress on the amendments incorporated to the project in the Senate, the government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of coming ino force before the year ends.
The representatives of different groups agreed in emphasizing the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree the best legislation for guaranteeing the protection of the investors and regulating in detail the organizations activity so that the markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while it strengthens the investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) and encourages cooperation among the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulations will grant financial advisory services to specialized companies as well as to natural or legal individuals, and creates a new type of financial advisory companies (ESIS), the financial advisory companies (AFI), that include stock firms, brokers, and the portfolio management firms.
In addition, it extends the number of systems available for the execution of financial operations, so included in the regulation are the secondary markets, the multilateral trading systems, and the internalization systems of orders, these will compete with the current stock market managers.
The law also requires investment services companies to disclose to the market the key details of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management, and to keep a registry of all their operations to facilitate the supervision by the CNMV.
In their passage through the Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress, several modifications were introduced, most notably securitised debts should be considered as a "complex" financial instrument due to its high risk for the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the high risk American mortgages debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition took advantage of the directive to legally define the functions that can develop graduates in Economics and Finance in 30 years after the decree approbation in 1977, that delimits the professional functions reserved to professional economists.
For its part, the Senate promoted the creation of new roles in the financial sector, such as the financial advisor, who will work for hire or reward, not require SEC approval and will be able to provide his services and marketing products brokerage to customers at various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized IPC increases five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, that later serves Eurostat to incorporate in the inflation rate calculation in the European Union, provides a prediction of how Spanish prices would evolve during November.
Its publication corresponds with Eurostat and the European Central bank (BCE) policy to offer high quality, timely data comparable with the ones produced in the United States.
This advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used by the Consumer Price Index Harmonized, but using different methods of statistical modelling to account for information which isn't available at the moment of its publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the indicator is only an example, it need not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be announced next December 14.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels".
The second vice-president and Economy minister, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the IPC increase to 4.1% in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time expressed hopes that the index prices will continue at "relatively high" levels for the next months.
In any case Solbes has emphasized in the Congress corridors that "although the figure is not good" Spanish inflation differential with respect to the monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
Also explained that November "has been less of a surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count on such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%", recognized the Economy minister with respect to the advance data today.
Virgin plans to make with Northern Rock 42,000 euros million in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to 12,000 million pounds (16,800 million euros) since it went in crisis in the middle of September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time it needed deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has been progressively falling in the last two months due to the distrust of its clients and in spite of the guarantee of the one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and who will maintain it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, that would rename the organization to its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of revenues in British banks that are deposited in next the three years to obtain those 18,000 million remaining pounds until reaching the objective of 30,000 million.
The group of the tycoon Richard Branson, known for his showy advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends spending 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on publicity and marketing research to achieve his purposes.
Northern Rock named this week the partnership of Virgin, which includes three other companies, as its favourite to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Detained the Totana's mayor for a presumed plot of city-planning corruption
Today, early in the morning, the Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (Popular Party) for his alleged conection with the city-planning corruption plot uncovered this week.
Also arrested was a secretary of the consortium and the head of the Municipal Police.
Jose Martinez Andreo, who last May was replaced by Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and then alderman of the municipality, and according to investigation sources consulted by the Chain SER, could be leader of this plot.
Agents continue registering the municipal dependants and the Urban Council and more arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer Juan Morales has been named as the main suspect of the city-planning corruption plot uncovered in the beginning of this week.
As reported yesterday the Chain SER, the lawyer of the Popular deputy Juan Morales, thus witnessed, was arrested leaving the Morales address with important documents related to the plot.
More, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the presumed fees charged by Morales in exchange for facilitating the company/signature of a city-planning agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono accepts to head the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and to preside over the Congress if won.
The ex- Defense minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the government president and General Secretary of the Socialists, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the Congress in case the Socialists gain the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the secretary of Organization of the PSOE, Jose Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that was held this afternoon in the federal seat of the party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the ex- minister because "it's important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, it was also pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego group socialist candidate will preside the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace the Congress president Manuel Marín, that on 15th November made public his decision of not standing for the next general elections and to abandon his career in politics to dedicate himself to fight against the climatic change in the university level.
The ex- minister has recognized that the Government president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left two years ago.
In addition, he has indicated that, like the citizens know who will be the economic vice-president if the PSOE gains the elections, they have wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he gains office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not insult or shout". And make it "more and more visible to the citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it appears that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to be speak with confidence and calmness is the Congress, the Government president on one occasion was interrupted in the Senate 26 times".
Also, he has praised the current president, Manuel Marín and "the good work he's doing" and has not wanted to be viewed as already occupying his post, not to fall in what, his adversaries could view as "arrogance".
Climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against the climatic change, put under merciless persecution by the skeptics of its predictions like those that prioritize other political and social battles, is forced to show an iron determination.
And as leader of the movement and as the president of the Government Zapatero thinks that this fight is more important that the one on Islamic terrorism and proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of the Government has contributed decisively to the Spanish heading the UE breach of Kyoto.
Who are the people responsible for the breach, in which sectors have they taken place and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it demands to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish which are the measures that are needed to restrain the climatic change.
Which companies will be affected, which citizen habits will have to be changed, which individual and collective power savings will we be forced to do, what economic consequences will it have.
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has neither been nor will be explanations.
Indeed because someone will have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climatic change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Such as the hundreth of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE, which close to the election may be dangerous to Zapatero, who has hastened to deny it.
That is, which one is to save the planet without doing anything, with pure propaganda, with slogans devoid of all real consequence.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, this man, who neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness, is very useful for election campaigns.
Always, if the contract part is limited to being only virtual, and we only pretend to move around by bicycle or to stay fresh with a fan.
Detained the Totana's mayor and the head of the local Police on a presumed plot of city-planning corruption
The Civil Guard has detained the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana, "popular" Jose Martinez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City council and a hostal businessman on possible city-planning crimes, sources have informed us today.
The edil was arrested at his home address and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose dependencies is at the moment with several agents, who also have gone to the Urban Council and the municipal management company of Industrial and Housing Soil.
These three arrests are added to six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation linked to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic ground to urbanizeable so that the Galician company Nuaria constructed 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were detained but not charged in the summary, that instructs the Totana's number 1 Court.
The six first arrests have gone before the court today.
According to information sources, the previous alderman of Totana and actual autonomic parliamentary of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former wife, proprietor of a registered real estate agency in Totana, has been arraigned, as is the current girlfriend of former alderman that resides in Murcia capital.
The director and proprietor of the Group Nuaria, the lawyer and industralist Vigo Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo Jose M.G., ground director of Inmonuar, an agency integrated with the mentioned group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the City-planning Crimes Group of Operating Central Office (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven records, the majority to companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Madrid and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of poultry product company well known in the region, that could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what became the largest residential complex of the Murcian municipality of Totana, that involved the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project presupposed the duplication of the population of the municipality, that has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies like Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate development; Conycase, that manages the parking venues of the streets of Coruña's, Venezuela and the Fernando the Catholic square; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; Preconiza advocated focusing on the promotion, sale and installation of the elements of construction.

Our Finnish correspondent provided this commentary from yesterday's Helsingin Sanomat, the most important Finnish newspaper (by the way in head of the PISA report about educative level in the world), which refers to what was published on November 18th, the same day in which appeared there a specific criticism to the book of Blackburn:
"The content of Philosophy signature has come to the public attention as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela's school.
To blame for the deaths, a high school student mentioned in his messages works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor and responsible for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that professors adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and affirmed that to study Nietzsche is not essential in the obligatory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes".

A colleague has passed information over the introduction in the Penal Code of the crimes over downloading from the Internet:
A. The downloading of one song would be a criminal offence carrying a penalty of six months to a year.
However, if you steal from the music store for a value inferior to 400 euros, it is considered simply a misdemeanour(article 623,1).
B. If you steal from the store up to 1000 euros, the theft already is crime, but the penalty continues being inferior to the one imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and you give it back 40 hours later, the penalty continues being inferior to the one for downloading (article 244,1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the interchange of degraded music.
To participate in a big fight carries a penalty of three months to a year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the interchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184,2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors' authorization carries a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, somebody is stretching the law a bit too far.

My attending physician gave me an article on a rare investigation titled: "Money produces brain activity, mainly if the others receive less'.
That is, that the feelings that are generated by the monthly wages of the workers depends on how much colleagues earn.
A study has been made by tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results have been published in the last issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life & Brain Institute, in Germany: "the hardest activation took place when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
The investigators observed that when both guessed right and received the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was greater.
I do not know if this conclusion required as much science.
The public prosecutor of the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has been eight years implacably pursuing the war criminals of the Balkans from the public prosecutor's office of the Penal Court for the ex- Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of year and Carla will go with bittersweet flavour, because people responsible for the Srebrenica's slaughter - where 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died, the ex-general Ratko Mladic and the ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in the list from which the Swiss documentary, produced by Marcel Schüpbach, takes its title, "Carla's list" (2006, not released in Spain), which has the pace of a police thriller, and follows the work of the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments concerned to strengthen the siege.
Which insurance is good for me?
The car insurance that covers the driver against possible claims, srepresents a major expense that would depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of membership, marital status, the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
Because choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First we must be clear what we are talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured.
This commitment is translated into an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company will receive the agreed premium and in return it is responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of loss.
The premium is the insurance price, which is established considering diverse factors, such as the age, sex, the length of membership, marital status, the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter, among others.
The insuring companies establish their prices based on the statistics, so that the greater the probability of having an accident is, the greater the premium is.
It is for this reason that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence.
Also, making use of the statisctics, companies have reached the conclusion that the married people tend to have less accidents than celibate drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the probabilities.
There are many variables that the insurers consider when establishing the price of the premium.
It is for this reason, that the driver has to study his situation to choose the insurance that better adjusts his profile.
Presented here are the most significant variables in choosing one or another kind of insurance that, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
People younger than 25 years have diverse disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price, as the reduced driving experience and the length of the membership.
Although, to be well insured, it is ideal to have a fully comprehensive insurance, other economic options exist.
The most cautious drivers can decide for a franchise with any risk, so that they obtain the insurance coverage, but at a price more feasible.
This class of agreement would suppose that the client cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps.
"The amount of the costs that contributes the client will be settled based on the value of the premium, that will be higher if this amount is lowered", specifies Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, mediator of online insurances.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the client is assured protection from damages caused to third parties, although not to those caused to his own car.
In addition, it would be covered for robbery, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are younger than 25 years try to be careful and avoid accidents as far as possible, since this will be an advantage, being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
An advantage is a reduction on the basic tariff of the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this base tariff.
"Advantages and penalties will depend on the company and its benefits.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to increase the advantages ", clarifies Noguera.
Once over 25 years of age drivers have an easier time of contracting an insurance, since the accident index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason the most recommendable is to contract a fully comprehensive with tax exemption.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident, or even when driving", assures the director in Spain of the European company, to which adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of driving, once the "fear of the novice" passes.
Nevertheless, if the client is married but still doesn't have children it is better to negotiate an comprehensive insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it, clearly.
On the other hand, people married with children are considered by the insurers as the public with accident rate, reason why the premiums will be smaller.
In this case the best one is a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption (this being of 300 euros), or, when it is had, a high benefit level, a third-party extended as the third life's year of the vehicle.
"They make a more relaxed driver and have a greater spending power to allow the luxury to assume an amount of greater tax exemption", states Luis Noguera.
For the pensioners an fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption (being this one of 150 euros), or a third party when a high level of advantage is had.
It is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver over possible wrecks, but because it represents an important cost, reason for which it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic looking in Milan a point worth eighth
Milan and Celtic are playing on Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they needed to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the "Champions" league, as the Italians are used to be first and the Scots for his sentencing classification.
The Italians added ten points and already certified in the fifth day pass with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that Benfica, which has four, do not overtake it.
These two matches of Group D will be played in one week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to play in the Mundial de Clubes in Japan, where they make their debut on the 13 in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final on 16.
So, this group will be closed before the rest and Giuseppe Meazza seems to expect a tie as the result, but the two teams will try to go for a win, and the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing into the quarter finals.
To the Gordon Strachan team could serve even a defeat for classified Shakhtar if not wins, but may not be trusted because equality on nine points means that the Ukranians pass, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in another duel live.
Thus, Milanists threaten to make it a bitter night for the Scots, who rely on getting into the quarters for the second time in a row in the restructured Champions League, after they were precisely defeated in this last round by a goal from Kaka in the extended time (1-0) after 0-0 in the round.
Waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar to which only the win will do, in the event that Celtic lost both get into quarters to continue in the UEFA.
And as to Benfica, despite being the last one and without any hope of staying in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, which play UEFA.
20,000 people in Vancouver attending the first concert of the Spice Girls' tour.
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver (Canada), in front of 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the concert at the stadium GM Place in Vancouver that the group meeting is "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people bought tickets to witness the concert that included a video which tells the group story that made furor at the end of 1990.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that includes their major successes as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo", which are published by EMI in Spain.
The five members of Spice Girls came out on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the public that filled GM Place, despite the fact that due to nervousness Victoria had forbidden it days earlier.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our apparel, for nothing, so I am nervous about what he will think about the spectacle."
"Sporty Spice" whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" led the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared".
"I was nervous to see that the world's sense has changed, the feeling about the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I am happy for having taken the decision" said Chisholm about the reunion of the group that she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been settled and we still love each other a lot."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls acted together for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived at Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, waiting for them there was an army of nannies.
Among the five joined seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will appear in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will appear on December 23th.
New Russia-Ukraine gas row fears
A fresh gas price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk that Russian exports of the fuel to western Europe may be affected.
Most of Russia's gas exports to the European Union (EU) are piped through Ukraine and any row between the two nations is keenly watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for the gas it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to reach agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more as it has agreed to pay up to 50% extra in 2008 for gas it sources from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine having to pay 40% more for its imports from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the top gas transit states during talks," Ukraine's Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should no doubt be linked to our arguments about the levels of transit fees [to western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev saw Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
That lead to a knock-on fall in exports to western Europe, which sharply pushed up prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the world's largest stocks of gas, but much of it remains under-developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must check foreign workers'
Scottish NHS boards need to improve criminal records checks for employees outside Europe, a watchdog has said.
The recommendation from Auditor General Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked with the Glasgow Airport attack in June.
Mr Black also raised concerns that NHS Scotland had no accurate picture of the number of overseas staff it had.
But his report pointed out other key checks were properly carried out across a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general looked into staff recruited outside European Economic Area countries, in the wake of the Glasgow Airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a Jeep was driven into the doors of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey by video link in October, charged in connection with the suspected car bomb attempts in the UK.
NHS boards are expected to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff to ensure they have the qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although Scots health boards use Disclosure Scotland to carry out criminal records checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain such information outside Britain.
The auditor general's report has now said, among other recommendations, that the boards should take on Criminal Records Bureau guidance, which helps employers with checks in several overseas countries.
"Although we found the some of the personnel records had evidence of these checks, this is not done routinely," stated the report.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS had a high level of compliance with its own pre-employment screening policies, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of overseas NHS staff."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees people who might commit future terrorist acts.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
Scottish health authorities said they currently had 1,161 overseas staff, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned the numbers were likely to be higher, partly because boards had problems identifying which staff were on indefinite leave to remain.
The investigation also found that established check procedures at NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely being met.
These included passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for overseas staff in the NHS.
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was keen to have this work carried out in the wake of the terror attack on Glasgow Airport.
She added the Scottish Government, in conjunction with health boards, would consider the recommendations of the report and would ensure best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff - including those from overseas - it planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominate film awards
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has scooped five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including best film.
Trophies were also given to star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was named best actress for thriller Notes On A Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety award for putting British film under the international spotlight.
The prizes were handed out in a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film - which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on the soundtrack - was shot for just £3m.
But it earned Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously best-known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, two awards - for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winner at the ceremony - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer took the Best Documentary prize.
The best actor gong went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver to a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, picked up the Richard Harris Award for outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honour of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney that opened the doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He's my type of guy, a great actor of the time, I'm really honoured."
The independent film awards, known as the Bifas, are selected by a panel which included filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 over terror plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for involvement in cells planning an imminent attack on an oil installation, as well as attacks on clerics and security forces.
State television in the world's biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle in missiles.
Sympathisers of al-Qaeda have mounted a campaign against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants led by a foreign resident planned an attack on an oil facility in the Eastern Province, the TV report said.
Saudi Arabia has been building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect installations after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006 on the world's largest oil processing plant, at Abqaiq.
The report, citing an interior ministry statement, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by an "expert in launching missiles", who had slipped into the country.
It said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of those detained were reported to be plotting to assassinate clerics and security forces.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis heading to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by hardline Sunni Saudis.
Al-Qaeda militants regard many clerics in Saudi Arabia as having been co-opted by the authorities into supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates government.
Militants - boosted by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to target the pro-western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential compounds, government buildings and energy-sector installations.
"This was a very large effort by security forces over the past... five months," an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests also included a "media cell" of 16 in Medina, which aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Those arrested also included 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
Climate on Venus may be glimpse of future for Earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft show the planet is even more like a wayward twin of Earth than was previously realised.
Venus is the Earth's closest planetary neighbour.
The two worlds are about the same size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on Earth and may even have been habitable, scientists now believe.
But a runaway carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and a slower rotation rate sent Venus down a very different development path.
Today the planet is stripped of water, has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a sobering view of how Earth might develop given catastrophic changes to its climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, of Oxford University's department of physics, one of the Venus Express mission leaders, said: "It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from the Earth when the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
'Enriched uranium' seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reported to be enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been arrested and the material was being examined.
He would not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said he did not feel it was dignified for presidential candidates to take questions from a snowman.
Nonetheless, the Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agreed to face a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and submitted them for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on the evening of Wednesday November 28th were quite as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and answers, this time reflected much about the state of the Republican party heading into next year's election.
It is not known how exactly the producers of CNN, which co-sponsored the debate, chose which YouTube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest dedicated to any single issue, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn up a dial when they heard things that pleased them: the broadcaster noted spikes of approval when the candidates talked tough on borders.
The harshest and longest exchange of the evening came between Rudy Giuliani, the national front-runner, and Mr Romney, who has nudged ahead in the crucial early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake a reputation that he was easy on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his house.
The two sparred particularly fiercely as questioners asked if any candidate would support an "amnesty" (giving illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to get digs in on the subject.
Neither man has a prayer at the nomination, but both remain in the race perhaps because they started beating the immigration drum earlier and harder than others.
At least on immigration the candidates, broadly, share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic toys from China or other worries about the outside world, helps Republicans forget, or minimise, the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate grew distinctly awkward when other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney debated whether waterboarding should be considered as torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr Giuliani to stumble towards the position that while the Bible was his favourite book, he perhaps did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, in first place in a recent poll from Iowa thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed whether Jesus would be in favour, he got a laugh saying Jesus was too smart to run for office.
The race remains unusually wide open.
Mr Huckabee's surge in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's recent fundraising feats and his hooting cheers at Wednesday's debate.
These two have surged from the bottom because the party's two wings cannot yet agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness and winks to both of the party's wings.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another hole to fall into; his way out of it remains the same
As British political scandals go, this one is not particularly juicy.
No honours seem to have been sold, no politician's Parisian hotel bills picked up, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the revelation that a rich businessman disguised contributions to Britain's governing Labour Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3m) over four years under other people's names, and that the party failed to report it, is one the embattled Gordon Brown could well have done without.
Two months ago, when the prime minister ducked out of calling an election, stupidly insulting Britons' intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, the hope was that he would provide sturdy, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' increasingly witty stand-in leader, put it, the once feared Mr Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The cackhanded rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Ill-thought-out proposals to change the tax code have drawn business groups together against the government.
The tax authority's loss of 25m people's personal details revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
A trio of retired generals launched a mutiny in the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being armed-forces minister is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now there are the multifaceted donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and its previous head of compliance), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr Brown is headed irrevocably for the exit.
Yet governments can reach a tipping point after which they find it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve things, and may not even be around for long, that suspension is over: the civil service starts leaking; cabinet ministers start briefing; the press looks for bad-news stories; and government becomes defensive and unfocused.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new broom.
Much though he would like to disown Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems to do with Northern Rock and the tax-authority records, for instance, are linked to decisions Mr Brown made as chancellor of the exchequer.
And even when he was not directly involved in Blairish mishaps - such as the long "cash for peerages" inquiry into political-party funding - voters may well assume he was.
Yet Mr Brown's predicament is not quite as bad as it looks.
The gaffes are not as appalling as the Tories are making out.
As with Mr Bean, no one has died, or been swindled outright.
And the remedy, painful though it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's natural Stalinist tendencies have always promised: reliable, sound and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Mr Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable giving, says he wished no public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be so, but the decision was not his to make.
The laws against anonymity for big political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land.
Mr Watt, who says he knew of Mr Abrahams's arrangement but not that it was illegal, will obviously face some close questioning; so will Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief fund-raiser who was told about the dodgy donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these convolutions, even though the bulk of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He was quick to condemn his party's breach of the law, but he diluted that decisiveness by reaching for a familiar tool, a committee of inquiry into the matter - led, for good measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Besides, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been without one for six months, and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political-party funding.
That would require hard-up Labour to co-operate with the Tories and perhaps give up its special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can grind out a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting America's credit-card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's housing market is ailing, predators have their sights on the country's credit-card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that credit-card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion spreads from subprime mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of strain are clearly visible.
There are rises in both the charge-off and delinquency rates, which measure the share of balances that are uncollectable or more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge in its American consumer-finance business, partly because of weakness among card borrowers.
It is too early to panic, though.
Charge-offs and delinquencies are still low.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, the third-quarter delinquency rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in America's personal-bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a big chunk of credit-card losses; the number of filings (and thus charge-off rates) would be rising again, whether or not overall conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
And confidence in credit-card asset-backed securities is pretty firm despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will end up being 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the subprime-mortgage crisis and the credit-card market certainly exist: consumers are likelier to load up on credit-card debt now that home-equity loans are drying up.
But card issuers look at cash flow rather than asset values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditworthiness.
They may even work to issuers' advantage.
The incentives for consumers to keep paying the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; card debt rises higher up the list of repayment priorities as a result.
Card issuers are also able to respond much more swiftly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders are, by changing interest rates or altering credit limits.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid repricing of assets.
"We are not going to wake up one day and totally revalue the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's chief financial officer.
If a sudden subprime-style meltdown in the credit-card market is improbable, the risks of a sustained downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a contraction in credit push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future.
Keep watching for those dorsal fins.
British Bankers Plead Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers who were set to go to trial for their roles in a fraudulent scheme with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent to seven counts of wire fraud for allegedly colluding with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at their employers' expense.
They were set to go on trial in January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
The three former executives at Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became a cause celebre in Britain throughout extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's 2001 collapse.
Charges initially filed against them in 2002 alerted Fastow that he was a target of the government's investigation into Enron's downfall.
The indictment against the bankers -- dubbed the "NatWest Three" -- alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of fraudulent Enron schemes that helped fuel its spiral into bankruptcy proceedings.
In early 2002, the bank had valued its interest in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control purchased the bank's interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for an interest in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the $20 million actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers got $7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and others skimmed about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three British men have been free on $1 million bonds that required them to live in the United States pending trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, crumbled into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions in debt or make failing ventures appear profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were wiped out after he died of heart disease last year.
Not Down and Out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 airplane, fitted with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But that is small change to some of the Russian rich.
"It seats up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them ask for that many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Mr. Firer was manning the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy of conspicuous consumption held at a cavernous exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury purveyors had set up display stands, hoping to interest newly moneyed Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-encrusted car grilles worthy of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer warily eyed a bright orange Porsche at the booth next to his.
"That's a nice car, but it is nickels and dimes compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second-biggest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as awash in cash as Dallas was in its heyday.
"We went through the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans came into giant wealth and flocked to Europe, where they were viewed as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi high rollers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's most visible free spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference on the luxury industry has drawn Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-tier rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires who are collectively worth $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a think tank here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She was attending the fair for the first time in conjunction with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune."
Wandering the halls Sunday night, dressed in evening attire, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described both themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who reeled off the designer clothing she was wearing like a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the nouveaux riches, the type of brand-driven Russian shoppers who would be willing to sit through several hours of traffic to tour a drafty warehouse that gaudily juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum penknives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was sitting patriotically at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, in front of a wall-size re-creation of a Rembrandt painting made of hand-painted blue tile.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
Indeed, vendors here said that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old, by Russian standards) have already moved on from flashy logos to the kind of understated limited-edition brands that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Still, several thousand people, whether cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or just tourists, thronged the halls every day.
And some of them were buying.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that outfits high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000, to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three car grilles, resembling interlinked chain bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car wheel, designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had encrusted with colored Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made out of cubic zirconium, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He is going to keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaire" did not convey much exclusivity at the moment, given the surge in real estate prices here.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company had erected four red British-style telephone booths, stuffed with piles of counterfeit million-dollar greenbacks.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire Fair.
Passers-by stopped to toss piles of money around, ask their friends to snap cellphone images of them reclining amid ersatz wealth, or just to pocket a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel himself a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Botched Surgery Suspected in a Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the big plate-glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance pulled up to the white Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon, there was a police patrol car.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van pull up," Mr. Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew somebody was gone."
The authorities would learn that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom the police did not identify, working in the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicology tests, the results of which might not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a spasm of grief through the top ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She would protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the Union County prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said that detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as the result of an unlicensed surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. on Nov.
21 and found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has gone by, and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh would not say whether Ms. Castro had been interviewed by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Ms. Castro's home, where a withered rosebush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue drum labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in a carport, next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks off to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate his new city's insular and rough-hewn political culture.
"She would say, 'You've got to watch out for this one or that one,'" he said.
"She was always here when I got here, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that Fed will cut rates lead to world stock market surge
Shares leapt on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Reserve will try to calm credit conditions with further interest rate cuts were boosted by soothing comments from the US central bank's vice-chairman.
Stock markets surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No 2 to Ben Bernanke, the Fed's Chairman, said that policymakers must be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued stress in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure fretful markets amid signs of resurgent credit strains, Mr Kohn said that recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of September and in October".
Should the elevated turbulence persist, it would increase the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the Fed stands ready to step in with fresh injections of capital into US markets, and possible further interest rate cuts, to stabilise credit conditions.
The remarks also helped to calm Wall Street amid more bad news on the US economy, as sales of US homes hit a record low in October.
The fallout from financial turmoil was emphasised by an announcement from Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will cut 650 jobs, or 4 per cent of its global workforce, in a round of cost-cutting to offset heavy losses from its losing bets on the US sub-prime home loans sector.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to go in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 per cent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of Britain's blue-chip companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 per cent, and France's CAC40 was up 2.3 per cent.
Earlier, the reemergence of credit stress in the markets was high-lighted after strong demand in an auction of three-month funds by the European Central Bank saw those loaned to Europe's commercial banks at a hefty 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and ECB and inject extra funds into money markets in London mounted as credit strains saw three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks pushed to their highest since late September, at 6.59 per cent, after a steady climb since November 12.
England faced with judgment call over the claims of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who should bat at No 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a wider context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of selectors who is on borrowed time under that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the England managing director, is starting to fill up with applications to become national selector, if not a part-time one.
Whoever does not get the sixth batting place will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport certainly is.
It is never easy to pin down what makes one man reach the top of his profession while another never gets beyond a lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, requiring judgment that always has to be subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair on Shah if he does?
The same might well be asked in another field of whether, say, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both bright young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what the right level is for a cricketer, unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next one?
Figures, naturally, have a large bearing on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he is to take a wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances up the order if he is to make an impact as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who did better last season, for example, than James Anderson, who looks certain to play in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself fit and bowls like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each to earn a place on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average, but both have had their moments at the highest level and hope for more of them.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium can be only a matter of opinion.
The choice might break or make either man's career, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time, who came through to become a substantial Test cricketer and, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in the wake of today's net session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and plump for Shah's greater experience over Bopara's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah's favour are his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings of 88 in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds to only six by Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord's, his home venue as a Middlesex player, and that, plus the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan was fit to reclaim his place for the next match, seems to have taken from his batting some of the élan that was evident in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex all-rounder has joie de vivre in spades.
He is fazed by nothing on a cricket field and his attitude off it was summed up when he recently overturned a four-wheel-drive vehicle at an exhibition day for England's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, shock, but the first thing that he did was to pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and phone Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching from a distance, to say, with excitement: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is much the better fielder, he is bowling his skiddy medium pace to some effect here on pitches that seem to suit him and is batting with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right moment another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah might not excel if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria started arriving in Baghdad yesterday, spewing out exiles who had run out of cash or visa extensions and others who hoped that the city was returning to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the militants who drove them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival from Damascus of 800 people in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad," Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor, said.
"I returned today because of what I saw on TV and what I keep reading in the newspapers, about what happened to Baghdad and how it was safe now.
They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to stand down for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbours in Amariyah telephoned to tell him that a local US-backed militia force had helped to drive al-Qaeda out from their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they started an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they need me and my boys' support.
That's way I returned today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many spoke of being lured by the increased calm in the capital since the US troop surge and growth of local "concerned citizens groups", armed and working with the US military to defend their neighbourhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa woes and dwindling capital in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, gave voice to common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian Government to impose visa restriction on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
"We were OK until al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the Government to stop giving the Iraqis visas, to force them to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burnt down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the drop in violence is that Sunnis have been purged from Shia areas and vice versa, creating many places where tensions are lower.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up sectarian tensions again and lead to fighting.
Tiny Saarland, Good Education
The smallest German federal state is leading the field in vocational training, and distinguishes itself through the international character of its university-level institutions in particular.
In one field of education, however, Saarland citizens are affected by the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I met someone not from Saarland, and I had to point out for the 50th time that we are not Frenchmen" - with this self-deprecating advertising slogan, the smallest German federal state celebrates its 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxemburg play major roles in Saarland's educational system, which, according to a so-called education monitor of the German Business Institute (IW), Cologne, ranks fifth.
The university-level institutions' cooperation with the neighboring countries, for instance, is part of a tradition.
Saarbrücken's university was founded by the French in 1948.
Even now, students there have the opportunity to obtain bi-national or even tri-national degrees.
As a consequence, the share of foreign students is large, making up 15.6 percent.
Nonetheless, the number of students native to Saarland is also above average at the state's university-level institutions, although many of those students do not have a diploma from a college-preparatory high school.
"In Saarland, many people make use of the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than every fifth adolescent acquires their higher-education entrance qualification at a vocational school, which places Saarland above the federal average by more than seven percentage points.
Opportunities to combine vocational and academic education are developed comparatively strongly.
Relative to population, the supply of combined vocational and academic studies ranks second in Germany.
Despite a practice-oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
Consequently, Saarlands Department of Education is committing university-level institutions to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences.
After the first PISA survey, we initiated a number of reforms at general-education schools, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education says.
For instance, the government introduced statewide comparative tests.
In order for children to commence studying earlier, the final year at day-care centers is free of charge  a model which other German federal states have begun to adopt.
Whether the students performence has improved substantially, future comparative surveys will show.
The 2003 PISA survey showed the share of at-risk students shrinking from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, Saarland did not improve as much as other German federal states, however.
Bavarins are better at mathematics.
And, much to the chagrin of Saarlanders, PISA does not evaluate foreign language skills  an area in which they might score.
After all, studying the neighbors language is mandatory at college-preparatory high schools  even though Saarlanders are not Frenchmen.
Chávez Turns Back Clocks
In Venezuela, times are about to change.
President Hugo Chávez has decreed that time-pieces in the South American country be turned back by half an hour on December 9.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a figure of ridicule.
According to the Official Gazette of Venezuela, a new law decrees that clocks be set to GMT minus four and a half hours.
Thereby, the South American state creates its own time zone that does not apply to any other country in the world.
Chávez, whose disposition towards the US has been hostile, cited a number of reasons for his decision. Notably, he alleged that the worlds division into time zones according to full clock hours was an imposition by the United States.
On Wednesday (local time), Chávez also announced a severance of diplomatic ties with neighboring country Colombia due to a hostage crisis.
As long as conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, the left-wing nationalist said, he would not entertain relations with Colombias head of state, nor with its government.
My dignity does not permit it, said Chávez. He is pushing for a constitutional reform on which citizens of the petroleum-exporting country get to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would provide a significant extension of his domestic power.
The dispute was caused by Uribes decision to revoke Chávezs mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribes decision was a slap in the face for Venezuela, Chávez had complained on Sunday.
Chávez is the talk of the town in Spain, as well.
A new ringtone for cell phones is causing a furor in the country: Por qué no te callas (Why dont you shut your mouth), says the line that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain. Annoyed by the left-wing populists incessant interjections, Juan Carlos had rebuked him at the most recent Ibero-American Summit.
German Wages Feared to Drop in 2007
Despite a strong economy, wage earners in Germany have to fear a drop in actual wages in 2007, projections say.
Experts cited a number of reasons for their pessimistic projections.
According to calculations by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could face drops in actual wages in 2007, relative to the previous year.
The causes are a modest wage growth, the value-added tax increase and price advances for food and energy, Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the daily newspaper Bild.
Additionally, new burdens could emerge for wage-earners in the unemployment insurance contribution.
Lowering the unemployment insurance contribution, as planned, to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was appropriate and reasonable in the present situation, Secretary of the Treasury Peer Steinbrück told the daily newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung.
However, the Social Democrat reportedly also said that the Federal Employment Office should not have to ask for federal loans or grants again.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that exploding prices for food and petroleum products were resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years.
Overall, there was a year-on-year price increase of 3.0 percent.
Venus Is Earths Hellish Twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than anticipated: European space probe Venus Express discovered lightning in the atmosphere and whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those occurring on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists suspected the existence of lightning on Venus.
Now, the European probe Venus Express brings confirmation  it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: On Venus, lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometers, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature.
According to the famous primordial soup theory, life on Earth was conditioned by lightning: Supposedly, thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean which in turn led to the creation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: If life ever existed there, it had to have been in the planets very early history, explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution, Washington.
Today, chances of life existing on the surface of Venus are slim: The atmosphere is about one hundred times denser than on Earth, with temperatures of up to 500 degrees.
Venus may be a devilish twin of Earth, but a twin it is, Russel said.
The key question of the ESA mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size, has undergone such a fundamentally different evolution.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 marked a milestone for Venus research. There had been no probe specifically designed to explore the planet since the early nineties.
The latest research results are now being presented in several Nature articles. According to the scientists, they do not just emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially anticipated, ESA reports.
In addition to the known whirlwind at the North Pole, for instance, the researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the South Pole, spinning at a significantly higher velocity.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in Earths winter hemisphere, writes a research team of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the solar systems second-innermost planet is almost the same as that of Earth, as is its size, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, which is also known as morning star or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
Its rotation is much slower, however: One Venus day equals 243 Earth days.
With surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, Venus barely resembles Earth. Nonetheless, scientists suspect that both planets developed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both planets. On Earth it remained in oceans, whereas on Venus it escaped into space.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is focused in carbonate rock, on Venus it makes up the bulk of the atmosphere.
Köhler Defends Merkels Meeting with Dalai Lama
German Federal President Köhler is demanding an end to the party dispute on the Dalai Lamas formal reception at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the Social Democratic Party because of its attacks on the chancellor after Septembers meeting.
Worried about Germanys reputation, German Federal President Horst Köhler asked the grand coalition to end its dispute on the Dalai Lamas formal reception.
We should not face the world as a nation that is divided on this issue, Köhler told the trade journal Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled his appreciation of the Dalai Lamas formal reception by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, a Christian Democrat, in September.
I consider human rights to be universal, even though I respect the diversity of cultures, Köhler said.
The President stressed that everyone was aware of Germanys obligation to maintain delicate balances in foreign affairs. However, he defended Merkel against charges of pursuing a new policy with reference to China.
The Chancellor has not departed from our traditional policy towards China.
China is aware of this, too, Köhler said.
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Social Democrat, had indirectly expressed displeasure at the Dalai Lamas formal reception, leading to attacks from the ranks of the Christian Democratic Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had criticized what he called the Unions showcase mentality in foreign affairs.
In the wake of the Dalai Lamas formal reception at the Federal Chancellery, there had been severe discordances in German-Chinese relations.
For instance, the Chinese government not only disinvited German Secretary of the Treasury Peer Steinbrück, a Social Democrat; according to news magazine Der Spiegel, it also suspended the so-called strategical dialogue between the two countries State Departments.
Chinas head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to concede that the Dalai Lamas formal reception was a mistake.
Stating Chinas disapproval of European officials receiving the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao underlined the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lamas actions and words showed his intention to separate Tibet and the broader Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China, Wen Jiabao said.
Schäuble Warns of French Riots in Germany
Clashes with the police, shots fired, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots similar to those in France.
Any steps necessary to prevent social discontent in Germany from escalating in public displays of violence needed to be taken, the German Federal Secretary of the Interior demanded.
Barricades were set aflame and rioters fired shotguns at the police: In the wake of the massive youth riots in France, German Federal Secretary of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble, of the Christian Democratic Union, fears similar developments in Germany.
We have to prevent the rise of social tensions which may escalate in violence.
We need to take this seriously, he told the Hannover-based daily newspaper Neue Presse.
Some young adults were finding it difficult to adjust to a social reality that is changing ever more quickly, he said.
Federal, state and local governments were already hard at work on the issues, said Schäuble.
These were not limited to the integration of migrants, he added.
Between the German Summit for Integration and the Conference on German-Islamic Affairs, we are beginning to see results.
But it was too early to sound the all-clear, he said.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that German suburbs were not suffering from the same urban-construction and sociological issues as their French counterparts.
In suburbs north of Paris, there had been violent clashes between youths and the police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were set on fire in Toulouse, as well.
Kenan Kolat, Chairman of the Community of Turks in Germany, is asking the German Federal Government to step up its integration efforts, meanwhile.
In light of the riots in France, Kolat warned of copycat effects.
The situation in Germany was not as urgent as in France, he said.
But there was still a need for action.
The unemployment rate among youths with a migrational background below the age of 25 was above average, Kolat noted.
Above all, more vocational training positions needed to be provided.
We need to provide options to these youths, Kolat emphasized.
However, the Chairman of the Community of Turks added that a social supervision in families applied in Germany more than it did in France.
In addition, many youths did not want to destroy what their parents had built for themselves in Germany, he said.
We still need to be careful, Kolat urged.
Youths needed to be given the opportunity to participate in labor and education.
In the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel, the night remained quiet, meanwhile.
Hundreds of policemen were on alert, and a helicopter circled the area with searchlights.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests as well as a number of burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the day before, a security force of 1000 has been keeping the peace.
After visiting the suburb, Secretary of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced that police crackdowns would continue as long as necessary.
During the night of Monday, about 80 policemen were harmed in riots.
In the following night, the unrest encroached upon Toulouse.
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident which had caused the deaths of two youths on Sunday.
According to an intial investigation by the Office of the District Attorney, the police were not to blame in the two youths deaths.
In the Realm of Angela in the Sky
Divorced from reality, the Chancellors performance documents that the coalition is at the end of its rope conceptually  and that expectations in herself have to be scaled down to nil.
What country, exactly, does the Federal Chancellor live in?
After her desolate performance at the Bundestags general debate, which was cloddy and bereft of substance, the verdict is: not this one  not in the country she ought to be governing.
The charge that she concentrated too much on foreign affairs, she dismissed with a terribly presumptuous statement.
It was provincial, she said, thereby demonstrating her refusal to grasp the critics meaning.
At the Bundestag, she documented, in plain sight of everyone, how right on target their criticisms are.
Neither a tangible concern for, nor any sense of the countrys issues could be detected.
Instead, she presented herself as Angela in the Sky: a detached politician who takes refuge in foreign affairs, but remains noncommittal even there.
Take, for instance, climate protection: She excessively blows her own horn on the resolutions of Heiligendamm, but does not share how climate protection objectives are to be achieved in this country.
And anyway, the self-praise  two years ago, the leader of the Christian Democratic Union would have denied herself this much immodesty.
Now she is clinging to the slogan that the economic boom has arrived at peoples doorsteps.
In doing so, she damages her reputation as a pragmatist who solves problems, instead of sugarcoating the truth.
But in the realm of Angela in the Sky, domestic issues are of marginal importance.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage earners?
A few asides are all she has time for on that.
It is telling how often she misspeaks when it comes to childrens allowance.
At this point in her address, Merkel needs three attempts to produce a reasonably serviceable sentence.
As soon as things become concrete, she stumbles as if on unfamiliar ground.
Attack Department
In the Youtube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, favorites Rudy Guiliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough exchange of blows  and now have to fear an underdog candidate.
The candidates tension is finding release as early as at the first subject.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into a safe haven for illegal immigrants.
The latter counters with bold allegations of his own: I would say his own home was a safe haven for illegals, Giuliani retorts, charging the former Governor of Massachusetts with having privately employed immigrants without paperwork.
The candidates mount the attack: Because the Republican base still lacks a clear favorite, the eight presidential contenders use the CNN debate, first and foremost, to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos submitted via Youtube by internet users contribute little more than cues.
This is the kind of isolationism which allowed Hitler to rise to power, John McCain accuses opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the group demanding an instant withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is sharply reprimanded by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to denounce the so-called waterboarding, an interrogation technique which simulates drowning, as torture.
However, audience reactions in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important issues of the campaign are far off from the Iraq War and the torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and the notion of future tax increases is rejected, there is applause from the auditorium.
In the process, the two favorites weak spots once more become apparent.
I was wrong back then, a remorseful Romney announces, apologizing to base and audience for having endorsed abortion as recently as in 1994.
Giuliani faltered when asked about his opinion on taking the Bible literally, meanwhile.
Musharraf Begins First Civilian Reign
One day after resigning as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
Thus, eight years of military rule in Pakistan came to an end.
On Thursday, President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term in office.
The ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad was broadcast live on Pakistani television.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and to act towards the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had consigned the office of army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, yielding to international pressure, by the US in particular.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now for the first time reigns as a civilian head of state.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had complied with one of the key demands of the opposition and of the West.
Ending the state of emergency, which Musharraf had declared on November 3, is another central demand.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will revoke the state of emergency soon after being sworn in, and by doing so meet another of the demands of the West.
Last week, the countrys supreme court had overruled all objections to the head of states controversial re-election on October 6. After declaring a state of emergency, Musharraf had filled it with jurisprudents who were well-disposed towards him.
In the northern Tribal Area of North Waziristan, four soldiers were killed and four more harmed in an attack on a military convoy, meanwhile.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Fathers of Krautrock Are Back
Germanys supergroup of the seventies is reunited: At a concert in Berlin, the three band members of Harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles.
To celebrate the reunion, Live 1974, a recording from their heyday, is released.
Even back then, they were much more famous abroad than in Germany.
The arranged sensation, then, occurs in the shape of three composed gentlemen at the dinner table.
Each of them has his little box in front of them, his wires and, most significantly, his keys.
Dieter Moebius, 63, wearing a pristine white shirt, is throning at the center.
At his left flank is Michael Rother, a paltry 57, wielding a laptop computer and a guitar.
And at the right, from the auditoriums point of view, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is bent over a mixing console in concentration.
Each of them is contributing noises, sometimes even a beat.
And once in a while, it inadvertently fuses into a conventional piece of music.
The gentlemen themselves do not seem overly bothered when it does, either.
The band Harmonias reunion has caused some excitement among Krautrock aficionados.
Although, it may be disclosed here: Specific inquiries uncovered that while the name was buzzing through collective pop memory, it was not so forcefully as to have this band being sorely missed for 32 years.
But why should Germans not be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the seventies, too?
Especially given that what is misleadingly called Krautrock had always been held in more esteem in England or America than at home.
When the music industry gave an Echo Honorary Award to the survivors of Cologne group Can in 2003, quite a few quizzical German pop faces were to be seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers proceeded to thank the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their panegyric, the bewilderment knew no bounds.
At shows later on, Michael Rother sat on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, like an old pal.
The problem with the ignorance at home and a misty-eyed view abroad is one thing.
Harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio existed for two years only, making much less of an impression in that period than others would attest in hindsight.
Moebius and Roedelius had earlier collaborated with artist Conrad Schnitzler, under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Schaubühne in Berlin.
After that, for economical reasons, for a record label owned by the church, in Düsseldorf.
Rother had briefly helped out Kraftwerk, and had subsequently made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, at the time perhaps the most radical German group.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile, to Forst, in the Weser Highland.
There, at the Alte Weserhof, an old ruin dating to the 16th century, they lived as communards, away from the cities.
Less ideologically than at Kommune I, where Roedelius had once labored as a nanny.
But rather living the Spitzwegian life of an artist.
Allegedly, a banneret of the Glee Club Harmonia Ottenstein was found amid some scrap, and thus, a name for their art.
Quite a bit of that was documented by Harmonia.
The first album was called Musik von Harmonia, the next one De Luxe.
Because, as relaxed and modest as the music may have sounded, the band was in great need, materially.
The brushwood collecting was not just for self-discovery purposes.
The newly released CD Live 1974 was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of 50, as somebody seems to recall.
It was Rother, back then, who wanted to push Harmonia and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius, it was an unethical proposition.
The band declared its split in 1975.
Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical field and earned his livelihood with albums such as Flammende Herzen.
Cluster became fashionable again in the eighties, and went on to be more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessem live album is owed to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label Grönland aims to preserve Krautrock as Germanys own distinct contribution to lively music.
Neu! has already been exhumed in the process, as has Roedelius solo work.
The in-the-flesh resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly funded, as part of the Worldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, Brit, former punk and author of the handbook Krautrock Sampler.
So is Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which offers a sketch of the whole range of influence Krautrock had on subsequent pop music.
Harmonias part is to fill the gap of the supergroup.
Along with the idiosyncratic sound, Brian Enos dictum is hovering in the room: The only true music, the future belongs to it.
Images of the producer, in a farmhouse room with Harmonia, appear.
Projections of further black-and-white fotos showing woozily wired machinery do their part in the making of a legend.
In front of it all, the three veterans are once again improvising.
No longer by sticking microphones to organ and drums in order to get the instruments to produce unheard sounds via the self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tinkerers preoccupied with technical aspects.
Even the resident choir doesnt change that.
Directed by Barbara Morgenstern, there is coughing and whispering beneath clouds of sound, and, at one beautiful point, Aaaaaaaah! is sung, with emphasis.
Krautrock, after all, has always been a very English term.
It never was rock.
The roots were to be found less in blues than at conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Those now exclaiming 68! are not entirely wrong, but, even now, Harmonia still dont lose their cool over it.
On the stage, even the most self-evident things are considered most thoroughly.
Where does music start, and when does it end?
It can wreck your nerves, or it can grant fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere Just Isnt Cynical Enough
The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden make two more films dealing with the Balkan War.
But neither of them is convincing.
Either the concepts put too much emphasis on action sequences and gunfire, or they are too maudlin.
Even Richard Gere, in The Hunting Party, cant change that.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic may still be hiding in the Balkan mountains. But right there, of all places, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been recovered.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately, after all too many nicely trivial roles in feel-good films for women and all too many press conferences on Buddhism had exorcised any desire to watch him.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the best reason why we would maybe want to watch The Hunting Party, after all. (The full German title is The Hunting Party  Wenn der Jäger zum Gejagten wird - why do film titles always have to be as long and dizzying over here as labor agreements for engine drivers?)
His performance is delightfully tongue-in-cheek. Essentially, his war reporter Simon Hunt is who Gere could have ended up as, had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him: A man whose heyday is long past, but who has preserved considerable shreds of his former charm even as a ruin-like monument.
Still, despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German production Mörderischer Frieden, which also debuts this week, merely continues the endless line of failed Balkan War movies.
Mörderischer Frieden can be dealt with fairly quickly: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian woman from Kosovan snipers - and one of whom promptly falls in love with her, to boot.
Although the fact that the Serbs, for once, arent portrayed as the sole root of all evil here is to be appreciated, the film, in its TV-like shallowness, quickly gets lost in gunfire and action sequences.
What remains is something like the German car-chase TV show Alarm für Cobra 11, only with war taking the place of the autobahn.
The Hunting Party, meanwhile, is kind of like exhibit A in the investigation on why theres actually never been a really good Balkan War movie.
With another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard is both), and at another time, the story of three US war reporters committed to track down Serbian war criminal supreme The Fox might have ended up becoming a new Apocalypse Now.
The stories, after all, are strikingly similar: In both, small teams enter the woods to accomplish something the military couldnt, and in both, the result is a journey into madness.
One of the reasons why The Hunting Party fails is that Simon Hunt isnt allowed to simply be the run-down cynic with a heart of gold were introduced to at the beginning.
No, the script also has to saddle him with a romantic relationship on top of that, with a Bosnian muslim woman who is killed later on.
The Hunting Party goes off the rails altogether when the reporters, in fast-forward motion, achieve in the last five minutes what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world havent been able to achieve in five years: To catch the war criminal and leave him to the just revenge of the Bosnian muslims.
This is so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the grounds of crimes against cinematic logic.
The films concern, however, is actually a deeply human one.
It wants to condemn the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still free as they please, and it suspects the Americans and the French (apparently they agree here, for once) of not being overly concerned with their pursuit due to secret political horse-trading.
But good intentions and evil are so similar sometimes that a popular poem by Brecht comes to mind.
In it, the wooden mask of an Asian demon resting on the poets working desk is described: With sympathy I regard the swollen veins on the forehead, suggesting: how hard it is, to be evil.
Films like The Hunting Party have those very same swollen heads, in that case suggesting, however, how hard it is, to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War movie.
Recently, it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood Iraq movies have utterly bombed.
One could add: There has never been a good South Africa movie, either.
Rule of thumb: If some star actor is running around in the hot spots or on the minefields of the world, the result is something like Rangoon, with Patricia Arquette, Beyond Borders, with Angelina Jolie, or Blood Diamond, with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly, all of these conflicts are simply to recent.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood was able to direct a good Holocaust movie in Schindlers List.
Some film or other may still mature  the Vietnam works The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket, now considered to be classics, were not exactly celebrated unanimously as masterworks at the time, after all.
Or maybe we just know too much about the violent conflicts of the world nowadays, with every instance of mass murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously.
And that robs screenwriters of the recklessness required to tell good stories.
Part of the reason why To Be or Not to Be or The Great Dictator are such good films, after all, is that Lubitsch and Chaplin didnt yet know how bad the Nazi regimes reign really was.
To be able to make good films, perhaps one must not want to be good.
Perhaps a sarcastically distanced artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolks is required.
Queried on the parallels between his historical novel Lemprières Dictionary and the Balkan War, he replied: Thats just because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in gruesome ways, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust Criticized on Olympics Withdrawal
The mayors withdrawal of Hamburgs application for the Summer Olympic Games has spawned sharp criticisms from representatives of politics and trade.
Many intend to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games.
Von Beust calls for a realistic assessment of the odds, however.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, Managing Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described the withdrawal as being not good for the economic area.
No other project had generated as significant a motivational force in the city recently as the notion of the Olympics, he said.
Without that goal, the current sporting-politics momentum could not be maintained to this degree.
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project, but to develop a new long-term approach that follows a different timeline.
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted on earlier statements on Wednesday, saying that Hamburgs Olympic ambitions were unrealistic, at least before the year 2028.
Its the German Olympic Sports Confederation that has to decide on an application for the Olympics, not Hamburg, Von Beust told Welt Online.
He was referring to the Confederations decision on Munichs application for the Summer Olympic Games in 2018, which is expected in early December.
What this preference means for us is that we wont have a realistic chance in the previously considered period prior to 2028.
However, this did not mean that the dream was over for good, Von Beust said.
The Sports Confederation Hamburg (HSB) regretted Von Beusts comments.
They created the impression that Hamburg did not intend to apply for Olympic Games for the next 25 years, it was said.
Its premature to spoil our odds by scrapping the plans at such an early stage, HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
Further, withdrawing from the application was contradictory to statements made by the head of senate on the occasion of a reception at a plenary meeting of the German University Sports Confederation, Ploß added.
There, Von Beust had insisted that Hamburgs application for the 2015 Universiade was no substitute for Olympic Games in Hamburg, he said.
The University Sports Confederation had nominated Hamburg as a candidate for application as recently as last week.
The Social Democratic Partys fraction at the Bürgerschaft, Hamburgs parliament, accused the senate of having wasted precious time by neglecting the construction of residences in Hamburg.
The senate delayed the development of Kleiner Grasbrook for years, because it had put all its eggs in the Olympics basket and neglected housing construction, said Social Democratic delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
Whereas the Social Democrats had always demanded an integrated concept for the Olympics with a view to a subsequent residential use, the Christian Democrats had been slanted towards the event factor, they said.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games had generated much excitement in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg was ultimately trumped by Leipzig, however.
Those Arent Warhols Boxes
Connecting the terms Sweden and wooden box makes one think of Ikea, rather than Andy Warhol.
Or does it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden are casting dark shadows on Warhols catalogue of work.
The bulk of the ninety-four Brillo Boxes Type Stockholm listed in it are forgeries.
After Swedish newspaper Expressen had cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhols 1968 Brillo Boxes several months ago, an internal investigation at the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, now comes to a sobering conclusion: The six Brillo Boxes donated to the Moderna Museet by former museum director Pontus Hultén in 1995 are forgeries  as, presumably, are the bulk of the nearly hundred further extant Brillo Boxes of the Type Stockholm in circulation on the international art market.
The history is convoluted, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Andy Warhol created his first Brillo Boxes in New York: painted wooden boxes based on the red, white and blue design of the Brillo soap cardboard boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1969 presented  with Warhols consent  hundreds of Brillo Boxes made of cardboard: For economical reasons, those were not by Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard mill.
They werent works of art, but their models  mere sample pieces.
Simultaneously, Warhol apparently consented to the production of a small number of wooden Brillo Boxes in Sweden in 1968, which, however, were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of approximately fifteen boxes which made art and auction history as original Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes with the designation Type Stockholm back then, and rightly so.
Some of them went for more than 100,000 dollars at auctions.
The problem, now, is that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, and subsequently consigned to him by Warhol.
As a matter of fact, however, Hulténs 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that point in time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes belonging to the Moderna Museet, Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the museum, also examined three in private Swedish ownership, of which two had been manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: Their pressboards were first primed and sandpapered, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 facsimiles reveals, however, that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a roller and without priming  and, further, that it wasnt oil paint, but acrylic.
These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes, says Lars Nittwe, Director of the Moderna Museet. Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York arrives at a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as facsimiles/sample pieces.
Of course, the Authentication Board had already announced an investigation into the grave allegations made in the case of the soapboxes back in July.
However, it has been shrouded in adamant silence ever since.
Renegade Soldiers Surrender in Manila
In the Phillipines, renegade soldiers surrendered after seizing a hotel in Manila and demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
At the hotel, leader Anthonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters that he did not want to cause bloodshed.
Earlier, government troops had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had occupied the hotel for hours.
On Thursday, around half of them had faced a court of law for a failed coup in 2003, including Trillanes.
The latter then seized the trial to make a sudden escape along with 30 sympathizers.
The military police charged with guarding him had apparently defected and joined his mutiny.
They seized the Peninsula Hotel, demanding President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to be overthrown.
Troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area surrounding the posh hotel.
The president called for an emergency meeting of the National Security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers actions.
People have had it, Trillanes said.
We are calling on people to join us.
Other military units were to join the march shortly, said General Danilo Lim, former leader of the Scout Rangers elite unit.
Regime critics had called for mass demonstrations against the president.
Her government has been facing allegations of corruptions for months.
Manilas financial district had already been the focus of an attempted mutiny against Arroyo once before, by approximately 200 members of the military back in 2003.
After nearly 24 hours, the insurgence failed when the armed forces refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Phillipines.
United Internet Major Shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share was 14.46 euros, the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It was now holding 20.05 percent in share capital, it said.
The announcement followed speculation about a takeover.
Options to increase its holding of Versatel were being kept open, the company said.
According to United Internet, the move is intended to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market.
Earlier on Wednesday, there had already been speculation about an acquisition of shares after Berenberg Bank had increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another five percent, to 15.1 percent.
The bank was merely holding the shares for a third party, rumors in the financial market suggested.
On the previous day, United Internet had already bought into mobile telecommunications operator Drillisch with around ten percent.
In the context of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million in new shares, with a total value of 106.4 million euros.
Of those, United Internet bought 5.15 million shares at 31.4 million euros total.
Further, the companies are in talks over marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile telecommunications products.
We are strengthening our partnership, a spokesman for United Internet explained.
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP in order to buy competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies will settle for a share of approximately ten percent and not make use of their option to buy another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies were keeping all their options open, especially with a view to increasing their share of Freenet AG, it was said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had been aborted in mid-November.
The months-long and at this stage fairly intransparent power struggle over Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunication market.
At the close of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed-line customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has, so far, directly held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares.
Now, it had been arranged for Drillisch to acquire another four percent, it was said.
The option to buy 18.49 percent from investment company Vatas had already been arranged back in August.
