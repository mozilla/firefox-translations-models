28-year-old cook found tot in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother testified that he cannot imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "At last we went up again."
The body, found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, said the forensic division in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as a murder and the investigation is going on.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS transmitter KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had earned his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that they were "shocked and devasted" over his death.
"We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO said.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD notification phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this clear in an interview.
"I am always put in drawers or glued on labels from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I don't want to always be perfect and successful."
"Honestly, these things are more snake to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at being considered a "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of a television with loose dut and Mexican food, it's the magazine.
To white burn, she raises the question of the desire to have children: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love - Love is no child's play" is seen by Aniston as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be shown here from the 25th time. August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their evening, chasing home to the feeding troughs in a fast pick.
One kilometre at this pace, I was afraid.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And that's what ended the funeral.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.
He and his family had he crossed the grounds of the ALRV, he did not even swung on a horse for photo purposes.
Langer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sport Aid presented the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen at a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete does not lack awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver bay leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Long is the 18th Winners of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only given for sporting successes, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been supporting young talents for decades.
And so he passed the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master's winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The awardees include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bob driver Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sport legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company went to the snip stadium, where the Lavazza prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the large animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump want that.
However, the two US presidential competitors are divided on tax and energy policy and on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep it rather small in doubt and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will massively phase back regulations, and he is setting himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.
Therefore, taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost the same word into this.
The Democratic applicant even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the Republican Party chair, for example, as is critical of the state-critical teaparty.
So Trump could still be held within party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil production is also intended to be possible in previously protected areas, and it wants to cancel the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands: "One country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it."
But not only with infrastructure - the two competitors are not too far away from each other, even in international trade agreements.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the USA from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They are to be paid better, Clinton, for example, demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance.
She wants to increase him to 15 dollars per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: The minimum wage has to go up, then he says he is not allowed to be changed.
However, the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop more around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.
His critics say that the budget deficit would only become even greater.
On the other hand, it says Clinton, who at least wants to demand that the rich pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman has refugees with sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby with it that is at most one year old.
One has put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His dam stares at the table top.
Until she realizes she is being observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until one talks to Katrin Bahr.
She is the division's managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social support services in Bavaria, and is concerned, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It is not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her run," says Bahr.
"Men flee because they are being persecuted politically because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a beacon of hope," she says.
In women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many are secretly stealing from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them away.
On the run, this continues.
"The fact that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example, is not uncommon," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who believes that this end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and at worst abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatised, she appreciates.
"Some of the children have certainly not emerged voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not dare to talk openly about what has been experienced because shame is too great."
Since they often did not know how to help, more accommodation is only needed for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for accommodating refugees.
When asked whether they knew about a project similar to those in Munich within their area of responsibility, some respond with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments.
Even in Swabia, women who refugees alone are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or their own houses in some shared accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the committee states: "It is very important that men and women are housed separately."
"If privacy is misplaced or when men and women are housed together, there may be - more continuous - violence against women."
The study says that washrooms in particular should be separated and easily accessible to women.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowds that exist for the house in Munich.
"Since word got around, we have had a long waiting list," says Bahr.
One could easily open a second house.
Residents strike: demands for new industrial action
Deputies of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes concerning a new treaty.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC said that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns about the Treaty.
In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "persistarily quiet" to problems, which led to the Treaty being rejected.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiation for all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action, which begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors on strike six times this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.
Head of BMA Assistant Physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin presents his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slim-lipped and he radiated little warmth, even for his reserved conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan behaved as if there were nothing bad ever done.
His enthusiasm seemed to me rather to indicate the opposite.
But a sustainable coolness radiating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin divided and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's back.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turks were to bear the blame for everything.
Most serious was the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to achieve a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed.
You are counting on a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment at the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d'état.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself is a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray one, as an analyst once described to me, "Alliance of Outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and ill-treated by the West and are now allying.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they did not even touch the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk to each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand will only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand that our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to become a brand bank, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?"
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sparkles champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profits
The jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is being trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said: "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the jubilation as he wins Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the steeasant steel milestone - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
It has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 winnings if he wasn't just a weekend and major tournament jockey!
Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he is far from finished - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until the age of 50.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's closest trust scene for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement by the Kremlin, it is that Putin had ordered Ivanov's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin's website states (in Russian) that he was later the protocol head and head of the government staff.
He said of his appointment to Putin: "Thanks for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as a head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are you convinced the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow secretly shrouded.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As a chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle here?
At present, nobody knows.
But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - arduous posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people to whom he most trusted.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin would have violated Putin's term.
But this post was taken over by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he returned to president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series following a team of FBI Agents will be published at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statement.
The 54-year-old, who previously played on the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been there since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into the last twelve years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but it will not be possible now.
I would like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who could only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is on the 28th century. September scheduled.
Mystery of fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandeeling, which were spied by a fountain.
Mr Bain, who approx. 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The project expensive to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck fans" who approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The Fife bridge section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 inclined ropes.
The project expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit today and was one of the first to take from the countryside to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering skill of a truly epic measure of this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used solely for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck are in their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure is pioneering building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck underneath, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern or land side.
This was reached by drawing the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massif, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, approx. weighs 6,000 tonnes and with a gradient of approx. 3% had to be pulled up.
Heziel, since the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men have "happiness still to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded the alarm at 13:20 on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on on their own.
"We saw the boat turning around it near her and imagined the worst," said the head of the Moelfre Vince Jones rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we let it water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stopping leash, but this broke loose from the person who had the boat headed when the boat was capable.
Someone has watched over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and body.
The police arrested the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
They alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street they met the ex-life vehicle of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be paid much more into account in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of action living" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?
A regulation has been lacking so far.
SPD parliamentary group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to rely on urban areas will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the inventory.
However, the big point of contention in the town hall is, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of their homes on such land, but as possible 20 percent of their homes as social housing."
A new urban housing construction programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is to provide incentives.
The problem said Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible to investors.
The left still wants hardened circulations for investors.
Regardless of this, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is paving the way.
If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is required.
It is unclear whether we will receive experts.
But the programme is not completely yet: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do we compensate for the loss of around 1300 cheap apartments, the funding of which will expire in the coming years?
By alone, there will be 500 apartments by 2020.
In order to prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, ties are now to be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing apartments back into the price fixing.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one fell shot.
Because in the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
You could bring around 1800 apartments back into the price retention for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing associations do not want that.
Because the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically again, one is moved away from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged people in only a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will be moving in the discussion.
Communist Party chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU has to go on board."
This has concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and child no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been deplored by many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I obviously refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the 1990s video games (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand something in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons who are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (taken over a screenshot on the phone) or "taken" "taken" once they have been found.
A generation that played the game when it was younger joined the delusion and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the US, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the "average" person covers every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of people who train 30 minutes every day picked up from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to make people "take 30 minutes of time," "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What is it?
A breakthrough has happened.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they didn't give us a reason to exercise, as this game does.
The new will lose its stimulus and the use will decrease over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
All along the line brilliant.
And finally Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the all-around title on Thursday and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world before everyone's eye light under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total result of 62.198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team camera Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles is turning on the smoothing beam during the women's multi-fighting final in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a surge title and the fifth overall, while she consolidates her reputation of being the best of her generation or even ever.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who has brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises, which include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton told her she said "the best gymnast I have ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold, would be considered a disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug after they have won gold and silver in the women's multi-combat final in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party, the team coordinator Martha Karolyi, who was retired, served as an exclamation mark.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, it is not really true.
Some of their ground exercises - which included their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That is no coincidence.
This girl, who was trained in the Boorman, adopted by her grandparents and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, where Boorman was considered strength.
She has not lost an additional competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina led slightly through two turns, the picture was wept.
Floating beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She caught up again with 15,433 on the flat beam - and put one on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her when she expected her end suffice - a pure formality - and tears were shining on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collector's book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal in a twist into a twist on Mustafina went.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her floor exercise, she accused the audience of koustering, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the quickly spreading tweet of 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial killer case while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who died in one of the deadliest attacks in a deadly decade in the first series killer in Phoenix while they were talking and listening to music in the car.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were arrested on 12. June shot while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, which can be read in the report.
The police announced that the threefold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the seventy-seven dollars, which were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shootout encouraged investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others were injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas, in four months.
"It is happening in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had concluded that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
liners, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which was targeted at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is based on what it was the factory of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6 year olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like a few of his retired-time, Edmund Mikrocephaly, the result of a genetic disorder, about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I did not get involved.
Which is not true at all -- of course they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize it.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people are still doing,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was spent three, and he still cannot speak.
But it is slowly making progress.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund has come up with for "Please sing something to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a number of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognoses can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been wondering about the forecast for a long time because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It gets better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Fierce rains, flooding gives rise to saving in Louisiana, Mississippi
Violent rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi River flooded their shores and threatened with large flooding after extreme rains, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that help was already on the way to the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, announced that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood early warning system was used in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will likely reach record levels over the weekend.
The metre ologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will slowly flow over the rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9.00 on Friday.
Rescue teams still plucked people out of flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water streamed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such an elevation of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed by Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "spread quickly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported from 13.75 inches of 13.75 inches of rain near Livingstone from midnight to Friday.
Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably severe due to the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities said that heavy rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and loss of teaching in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an assignee in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, who were now both inundated.
The head of the community Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flood.
Emergency shelters were set up in the towns of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the floods and sandbags were provided for residents to take the houses and shops, who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but no one has been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets," survived shooting in Philadelphia
The police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time this week that a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious at his career during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delore's Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether the perpetrators were under one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles covered the scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuous struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were pods.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police skin punchor Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I present myself to the women's Olympic team in gymnastics for more than one reason.
First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who seemed inspiring for many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and round off Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the USA.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts has been an African-American woman.
Last year were Simone and Gabby No.1 and 2 year.
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected, yet masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-fight event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but gymnastic classes do not look like this throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competitive and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts). The list can be continued at will.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to provide the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gymnastics train.
I founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high quality gymnastics, who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits, as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls take an interest in gymnastics and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by bringing the Olympic team gold and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to begin her way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Residents want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the amendments by adopting a Reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors voting in an election refused him.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to introduce the contract, saying that the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to the staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend works in order to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistant doctors, said last night in a statement: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by talks met with reluctance to participate in the government and sometimes to deafening silence.
This happened to the one promise that Jeremy Hunt had made just last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the imposing and address the concerns of the assistant doctors".
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide cover to doctors in the pickpocket chain.
Ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS employees, called on the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Nothing achieves with little work movement, but already overburdened teams and service providers and prepare only worry, need and interruption for patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have spoken to the resort of the assistant doctors and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries to the concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional break, training tests, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The Ã2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a Ã2 per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form substrates.
When the pad is breaking apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The instruction design by NICE, which was released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft instructions do not recommend any treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness flourishes electoral fraud in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlet's Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has caused widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to knowing how a devastating government report today reveals.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse based on "seversitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Former Minister of Integration and the Local Government, now a king of corruption, said that the intimidation of religious voters would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off bands outside of polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should have an identity to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter simply has to give its name and address.
The report suggests that non-removable ink applied to the finger of a person when they give their election vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but also aims to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cygonally perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with ridicism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal ballot - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including keeping ID cards to prove the identity
In his report, it says: "It was appropriate to prove that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to the ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to cleanse the system, including the ban on political activists processing postal ballot documents to stop "Election Learning".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires harherer registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider using options to ask voters before the election for your ID.
Do not use removable ink on a person's finger once they have cast their voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Implement systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for an automatic postal dial.
Prohibition that political activists will work full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police the authority to set up barriers to elective stations.
An amendment to the law facilitates an indictment of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photography ban in elective stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the elective stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no lawsuit was filed after the Tower Hamlet's case.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy to be unsuitable for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He became affluent for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings - due to a number of reasons.
He also criticises the ineffective "abhak controls" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court decision in Tower Hamlet last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kate's double cyclist and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio were out of the edge and band this week through French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which has proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from being the only gold-struggling athlete this summer who has his own famous double - at least not if you are allowed to believe social media.
In honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team team in archery Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Apart from the Kate's double on the racecourse, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after looking incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star showed up.
In fact, the archer gained madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarity, except facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I'll take it up as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become even more focused this year: the allure-like similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is to be able to pass through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One gear higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blond hair such as actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the couple's similarity
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medalist in the gymnastics gymnastics, who has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the dr 4x200m freestyle swim swimhill outrage spectators of the CBC live broadcast of the olmypish games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologise after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and "dame died" during the race like "a pig."
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swim swim.
MacDonald, who had been brought to the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, Baby".
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squadron 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to catch the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"???
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming spool for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many confronted him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, Ã...ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment of a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate phrase, we are sorry that it happened."
CBC apologized over 90 times to the people who responded to the noticed via Twitter
Commentator colleague Scott Russel apologised on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the show and our followers on social media yesterday night.
To make one thing clear, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympis, he said.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no displeasure was intended and I am very sorry."
Primark buyer outraged by women trying shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off their clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she looked at how she looked in it, pulled it out and put it back on the shelf.
She kept browsing and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where woman tried the underpants before putting her back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, picked up her own panty pants and pants and tried it on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared at the underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, because she put her back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally decided that she didn't like anything, dressed again and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the underpants she had tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants who was wearing another person and who were not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I noticed, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing her and went out again, and they were not washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said: "Primark is the incident that will be on Tuesday, 9. August happened consciously in our branch in Folkstone."
All possible products were pulled out of sale.
How to protect yourself against weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approaching you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the puncture around for your robber.
If you are approaching you from behind, then you should be the first to turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then seize the weapon between your forward arm and shoulder before you hit him in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with his knee in the groin and twist the gunman from his hands while the attacker bends together in pain. Hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while they point the weapon at him.
With attackers approaching from scratch, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi makes it.
But remember that when robbing, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright speaks his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a guide
A British traveler subjected his immune system and ghost reflex to a serious test - by jerking off some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, hasth on a Euro-ticket, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before bleaching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved in.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", revealed some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left behind more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to cisterns from toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film he said: "Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned in my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their lumenometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says: "That comes close to the worst things I smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing dirty than that!
I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We were doing crazy brainstorming sessions that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information about this in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was directed by the film, added, "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to get Ian to lick them and others who were quite difficult to do.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent, said that they use at least occasional products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall before deloge
An anti-social family left her social housing after a debait with a damage amounting to 50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their estate, shocking employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is believed to live in a private accommodation now
Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment was unable to repair.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider, since this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and its reputation is too.
The couple had three sons who had lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug abuse, and excessive screaming, quarreling and cursing included.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn open
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly debated them and her partner from the estate this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily suspend.
The debait was cheered by easier neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care for anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we could not sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family has failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delogment is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and had to be terribly watching their actions for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who bravely approached us and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deslogan was left on the floor
Workers of the property administration will now have to clear away mountains of garbage that surround the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash, amounting to 1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after being guilty of a class B drug guilty in trade intention.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone was her son Lee Skeldon, who was killed in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
The police say they will delying tenants who do not comply with the house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said that the deslogan was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, and those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet flying over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portable P-3C Orion Air Force Airplane made an incredible dive
The air force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that no safety risk was present
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet plunges down over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost within reach by the sun lovers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming up through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly by on social media, said: "It flew away really very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to identify them.
The spokesman said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility conditions due to nearby fires, but the air force insisted that safety at no time was at risk.
This summer, wildfires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, where four people were also killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his view
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worry against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans are competing in the duel for the Spanish Supercup against FC Sevilla, the second leg will be held three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must do without Neymar, who is competing with the Armenian Cup finalist and the ruling European League champion, who is playing the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament shoot in the knee in training, which means that the one-shelf question at Barca has been clarified at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen in Barcelona have been competing for number one status for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far renounced a clear decision in this respect and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Before the first competitive game of the new season, there are doubts to the Spanish champion about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated with 0:4 in a test match of Liverpool on Saturday.
Even at the 3:2 in the rehearsal gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2-3 defeat for an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aspires to the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic table tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5,4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world ranking first took the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at the World Championships, World Cup, World Tour final tour tour and just the Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
As expected, the two Chinese made it into the endgame and were the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would win the individual title in the sign of the five rings.
The latter non-Chinese on the top Olympic pedestrian was former SVS-Lowery Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left to the record alone, between the sentences and during time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés go alone in fair competition.
"I've played the matches for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang said logically.
After the game, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really struggle with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the plate and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected rousing match did not develop.
But there were nevertheless sufficiently breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The wavicular had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-finals against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, afterwards was undergoing medical treatment, had to be "ultimately" contented with sheet metal.
By the way, Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourth in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump grants 'guilt up problems' in the election campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns suffering their majority in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the multimillionaire, which usually occurs large and self-confident, expressed something like concern, as correspondents reported.
After losing 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians who asked for support in key states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
The fault was false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds wiggle
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a poll by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the ground.
Other institutes look forward to Trump, but not by the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview with the CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's advance again: "Just like what I have done so far."
And said after: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing other than "telling the truth."
If it did not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party is said to have threatened to delete funds to support his campaign if he cannot present better poll ratings.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress wanted to help more.
Olympia: Threeth fraud in doping testing
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athletes face unconchoice after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it was immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had submitted a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team leadership by the doping controls.
The IAAF Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to initiate its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate the IAAF," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and spent herself as Ferguson Rotich, who had spent the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chef de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He held the accreditation of the athlete, which was on the list of training controls of the world anti-doping agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 in the World Cup.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed about the upcoming doping tests against payments of money from his country.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
After numerous doping offenses, Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for some time.
When announcing the more than 2000 doping targets launched by the IOC before the Rio games, it was unusually noted that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular were being targeted.
Before the Summer Games in Brazil, the world anti-doping agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose fight against doping complies with WADA's rules is compliant with the rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 Beijing World Cup.
In a number of ARD television reports, accusations were repeatedly made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It could be proven that this sport was doped across the board and systematically.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit, the SimÃ3n BolÃ3var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and tune.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony with melancholy, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
I have always fascinated the role of Mary.
Firstly, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there is Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So it is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"It resembles me very much, my Italian character, whom I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honour for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of its movements, in its looks, it is its life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "This is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
These are the same issues, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl joining ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - preventing people from ever making that decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London went on an airplane to Turkey and then to the Syrian border in a bus.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain in the event of an election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Supreme Court Antonin Scalia judge.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman of Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the supreme judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination were lackeys and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also stated that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants naked calendars for "Women and for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine differed from old school playboys because "playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar does it too.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the chairmanship of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers who flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a hundred thousand", the association's chairman, Ali Toprak, believes.
Due to the crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted coup, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass exodus to Germany.
"In the short term, I am counting in Germany with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand those seeking protection from Turkey, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Friday's head of the association Ali Toprak.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive operations months ago, 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey.
After the foiled coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks are added.
Many people in Europe will want to start anew if they are continued to be suppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be the case that a state that hosts refugees himself produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
This means that Erdogan wanted to increase the issuance of the trip to the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the Federal Government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is held.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition members.
The fire marking as Gülen supporter destroys teachers and other academics from their professional lives.
"Anyone who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation for Dialogue and Education, of the "world".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks presented the largest group of those who are entitled to asylum in Germany recognised for political persecution even before the coup.
As of the reporting date 30. June these were 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 percent of all recognised as entitled asylum (3,625).
This uprising does not include those fleeing from war, poverty or lack of perspectives.
According to the Basic Law, individually persecuted persons are exclusively political, i.e. by the state.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get any of the summer election campaign - and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
After all, it is not possible to go: summer holidays, heat and state choice fight - that bites.
The locals who are to be convinced by the campaigners are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end up counting voices, are only arduously found.
Until the 4th On September 2016, the election and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave the election campaign narrowly over the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What is exciting about how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end up with coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is taking an almost inconspicuous election campaign, are seen from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and plajats a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blossoming of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "we are creating this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like when you campaign in the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Merkel Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there as Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently on NDR.
But it doesn't shame anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely does without the usual election campaign stands on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert believes, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are struggling away in the countryside the base, and it has to make a great effort to find a connection to the people again.
It goes like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly exist in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his colleagues is also self-laughing: "You have to go to where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were most recently behind partners CDU (25) with 22 percent and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn holiday emergency into a modern virtue and largely move their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign" is called by the country chair Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green certificate fighters search for local voters among holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, just curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it nice.
Her impression: "Election holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty".
B27 remediation: Restaurants suffering from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
There is everywhere praise for those responsible for the construction work, who start at 5.30 a.m. and end only around 8 p.m..
"They made everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet filling station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site was moved to the south at the beginning of the week at the beginning of the week, and everything is to be ready by the end of October.
It is also praised by the accommodation of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up the set-up of getaways.
Since the construction site has moved south on Monday and the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation inside the village has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen on the B 27 again on both sides.
The evasive traffic through the town seems to be back.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints," says the deputy head of the Florian King, who is responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many sought ponds and were more familiar with their navigation than signage.
This led to some trucks flipping in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality increasingly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable overruns," says King, who once said care about the situation on site.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was on the road at 77 kilometres per hour in the -15th zone.
However, since the construction site moved on, it has become calmer.
For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small consolation that the street is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 reprimand has led to slumps in sales in the process allows everyone you ask to see through.
However, some more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, the refurbishment has hardly any consequences for this.
At the Maier car dealership, too, Thomas Sulz speaks of an "highly slight decline," but also admits that of course "the walk-up skills are missing".
The most shaken are the most shaken by the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly a Krone, finds clear words.
This is already threatening to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
He estimates the loss of sales at "more than 50 percent".
The road renovation has set its operation "set back around two years".
Half of his employees he had to release.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been laid off, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, at a request from Göhner, President Jörg Schmidt responded with the indication that the restaurant will benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, referring to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now stop by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't come here, it's also beautiful elsewhere.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will come back after the renovation work has ended.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that is already brutal.
Laws are constantly being severely linked in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Home Secretary de Maiziere is now presenting a thick safety package.
But what does a survival status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maiziere gives the Reconciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
They overwhelm no one.
Other, further points would be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
However, as the Minister of the Interior, he is interested in the results and a "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maiziere had a little time lost before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: the fact that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprised.
In part, de Maiziere starts a second attempt for proposals that had not yet been possible with the SPD: he wants to make a criminal charge for sympathy for terrorist groups and button jihadists with double citizenship the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and does not challenge anything that has no chances with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maiziere.
They have a sometimes time: He plans fast-track procedures for deportations and more opportunities to detain people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought to the country are to have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
When tolerated by rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse off than before - for example, those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things still seem unforgettable and leave questions unanswered.
And with some points - for example, with the unequal treatment of patients - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror?
Yes, says de Maiziere, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied people could not be excluded even in election campaign times.
Internal security has moved enormously into the focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, election campaigns are coming up.
Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
In recent days, the two parties have been going high.
First a certain dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a certain collection of ideas of some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a ban on burqa and a departure from double citizenship.
Here, too, De Maiziere struggles for conciliatory sounds.
He does not keep anything from a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It does not make sense to make anew.
And he has constitutional concerns in a ban on a burqa.
Whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to show.
There is a lot in it that could cause an argument.
But the SPD is also currently trying to distinguish itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first signals cautioniously readiness to talk and says: "The SPD is prepared to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite the diesel scandal, deliveries are rising worldwide.
But it is not smooth in all markets.
There are vertebrae around a term in the recall action.
Volkswagen will start deliveries in the second half of the year.
Despite the diesel affair, Europe's largest car manufacturer has been able to achieve an increase this year, despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, thereby once again burdening the overall sale, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
With 449100 cars, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, after China, sales were 14 percent lower than in the same month of the previous year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries slumped by almost one sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July, mainly to two days of sales less in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on leaving the EU, a spokeswoman also argued.
In the USA, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus in the area.
The large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the mainly affected banknote of Lower Saxony continues to come across the diesel scandal anyway: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is included.
Group Sales Director Fred Kappler continued to show a sales increase from January to July.
At that time, Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles, worldwide, 5.904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to be converted into the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer provides the customers with a "guarantee-effective" certificate after the conversion, but do not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said in corporate circles on Friday.
This is due to legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting was held.
"VW has to fully meet the requirements of my investigative commission and the KBA."
"Dissipation of this is not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and that all type approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was said in corporate circles.
With the wide term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop with engine damage for example with an engine failure for six months after the conversion - and could reduce this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid in the interests of customers that may lead to uncertainty about possible warranty arrangements, as they said, any other damage that has nothing to do with regard to the exhaust scandal.
That is why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on current or call money accounts".
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "do not have to fear paying for their savings size penalty interest".
Banks Banks money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will require this fee to be returned by private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to current or call money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be accelerated from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in the central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend 4000 euros on every million."
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Having the cash simply lying in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I have experienced four attacks now, I would not like the fifth," said the bank executive.
Most customers would understand and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association declared: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy stance causes considerable costs for all banks".
To bear them alone is "in economic terms not permanently possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits of three million euros, the Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the banking association, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay charges for deposits across the grounds, and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong."
A banker said that there was "a clientele on Lake Tegernsee, which is somewhat more lavishly equipped by the fortune."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if they were looking for money free of charge.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate a charge for deposits of private customers," said Spokesman Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, explained at the end of June: "The threshold of going into the negative compared to private customer is very, very high."
The competition is tough, and it is threatened by investors' migration to competition.
Customers in Germany will not fall for this in the breadth.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the commentary section to sow it under the pseudonym NotAllsamemenMiddle Ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53% and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me, while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a humble grey suit and squander wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something determining like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even if Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers were once based - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of dates: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate," he says.
I have approx. 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things that I was probably a little too young to buy them from me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That is my vice.
Wez 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves making their old records buying their old records again.
Of the conversations I have had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain to the boom in supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores provides a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that call for happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It is an easy way to engage spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" intends an employee from a pile of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I leaf through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came here only recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less scarc.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, which has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I think.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the shops mentioned above - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz booms from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them looks very lonely, but gnawing psychological traumas are difficult to detect if you are standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the store for several minutes and looks at the variety of records for sale.
It is more like a window shopping than a bulk shop.
It doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.
While I give the semblance of exacerbating the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group themselves for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley record player.
There is a staircase on the left, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
Nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "plate art".
But considering that each attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most on luxury items such as records.
Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors and record enthusiasts who exist in reality, record stores and online forums, at least in record stores in Soho.
These people are probably working hard in school or offices.
They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning strolling through record shops of Berwick Street and browsing through records, while she avoid the staring gaze of an eerie 30-year-old false presenter who rises up over the shoulders of middle-aged men of no idea.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
More scientists say that Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was a female, which is based on the age of 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish business in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais, killing dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 temporary stores where people within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy from which taxes would not be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and medical capacity.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also explained that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people who conduct the 72 provisional business, but acknowledged that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
The judge Jean-Francois Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than feeding only people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the demise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run by the non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the closure would be "for these children a disaster, the youngest eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in newcomers over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic trial, professional cyclo-bician Tony Martin does not want to let himself be defeated.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, staying confident and continuing to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the Sugarloaf Mountain.
"To be honest, it is hard for me to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He must analyse in peace what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time trial world in Qatar in October, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed recently."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time-trial world champion, who had lost to the 54.5 km of more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemond misses semifinal
The triumphal march of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed out on a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, which was plagued by back problems, could only afford its impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, medals promising Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German professional tennis, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games were last seen in 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic single semi-final.
Group enters into account at start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from.
The technology company buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
Microsoft did not say how much money for the acquisition is going on Thursday.
Beam was only launched in January with its offer and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The player ties Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
Facebook is to help on the way to the global media event.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The start-up's employees, which has previously based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, moving to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
The acquisition should therefore not change anything for customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by the online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google's mother alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's speeders have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which are to be transferred to speed sexes particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, on accident areas, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be remediated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complex.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: His battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.
Laser measurement technology can also be used to detect all vehicles across several tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as passage bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the ramped state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
To prevent it from being stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and, by the way, bulletproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and now also used in various federal states, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain brings silver in 7-seater rugby after Fiji gets gold
The impressive performance of Britain at 7's Rugby final came to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis in the final on Thursday night, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side stepping, shooting, liner and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of all colors.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-worse consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in its best form.
It could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path.
Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This slack will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let GB's attacks bounce out of fun.
It felt like you were running in moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. The World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea faded Kolinisau in the corner.
With another four minute playing time, Jerry Tuwai suggested another attack from the right corner he was converting.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji stopped it only.
In the seventh minute lete Jasa Veremalua touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resume and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou cast through further weak stretcha of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.
That is how it is.
GB made fundamental changes at the halfway point and closed the Fijian gap...for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant middle play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for the UK, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favour of the South Seas Islanders, whose fans sang, flags waved and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame using the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked the lawn beat in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the 15-APS team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing win by fighting the trainer's cancer
There will be no more emotional gold than these games and that means something.
From the first wake to the last, 220 hard tetthankmen who go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were sitting at the helm, there were three votes in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was allious when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports to set such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, after all, her 39th undefeated commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and it was no one who didn't help but the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operatable and they did.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to be better off soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it begins.
Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts of Williams, who spent a nerve-racking morning talking about it spent something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be somewhat extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thanks go to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I could not have wished for a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any races in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen shouted "give in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't out to do something great.
We didn't want any fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before they make decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
This would have meant too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
Ensures exemplary clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary on Bavaria".
A small Francoising drinking water purpose as a model for the large water producers.
Some time ago, it was said in the original sound in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the association.
The work of the Veitenstein group is "in Bavaria as exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was an employee for 31 years in the association, 28 of which are managing directors.
Now he retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, which is based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, produces around 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with around 5500 inhabitants.
The member communities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other towns and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the special purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they included construction and maintenance work, office and organisational activities, budget preparing, calculating fees and contributions, and emergency operations on weekends," said the chairperson.
As outstanding events she cited the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), property purchases in the area of new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the elevated tanks (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no standstill and innovations have been repeatedly absorbed, because water lives mean and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudatory speech, she praised Gller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has championed his water purpose with a lot of passion and he literally lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate lowering in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water attendants Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water attendant and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association as a highlight.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the pipe break at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on a 3rd. January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it would work all night to ensure that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the elevated container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will succeed Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great strides," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
However, Tiago, who is now eight years old, has made good progress and are now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, when I ask him something that lay two years ago when I was singing at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship statute in Bargteheide - Man shoots at his partner
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Kinmarn district) on Friday at around 10.45 a.m. and killfully injured them.
"The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his partner," said a police spokeswoman.
The perpetrator was on the run, after him was publicly searched.
Meanwhile, nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and has a bald head.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
It is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald head.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the weapon with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., you should call the 110.
The police speak of a "relationship".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the event or the relationship between perpetrator and victim; however, it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It is a killing offence."
"We don't say anything more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operations command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs amounting to millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity promotion are off the box.
Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) said that the existing plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry is being exempted from the renewable energy levy for renewable energy levies.
"I am really happy that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel manufacturers who use gases from the blast furnace for their own consumption to pay.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now an agreement in principle with the EU Commission following talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills does an EEG surcharge of 20 percent incur.
But even these are not surveyed in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own electricity generation.
This largely enshrines the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our 'steel is future' campaign, this is a first step."
"Further must follow."
"The climate and employment targets must also be weighed up in the reform of emissions trading," explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen when the world's largest producer country, China, throwing massive steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers are showing price dumping Chinese steel companies.
In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel are having an effect, and economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices had stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
In recently, Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, as reported by the German Steel Association on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's
The association expects increasing emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
Ursel Kipp has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied teaching music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing Hackler.
Through regular being together, senior citizens can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also had this experience in her choir: "To be informed and organized, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a chorus is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because senior citizens train deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands their lungs does not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to preserving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouses many memories in older people, often combined with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even their migrants remember sometimes in long past events.
When singing, the head also demands a special achievement, Lenz explains.
Focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice to concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns from singing in chorus, says Hackler.
An avid audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for something for a long time, I will become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There is plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
One does not sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the friends in a senior choir can be easily connected.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.
If you feel like singing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for every age.
Cats react more sensitively than cats to cries of the young animals
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the males did not leave the males cold - however, in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can see the arousal of cat babies on the blacken of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to lute of kittens, who think they are in great necessity, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and Hannover Medical School (MHH) have discovered.
Hangovers react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and strongly excited young animals are either imperceptible or not of importance for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the kitten slackness differs with the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult males and eight female henchmen from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played calls from small ones, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated by mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more strongly excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
Despite the low sample, the researchers consider their results to be meaningful.
"All females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the very excited kittens played.
This ability might be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski attacks with "Gala" Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Already when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted coup in July, the government asserted that the everyday life should not be affected by ordinary citizens.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom one blames for the coup attempt.
It is also not stopped before football.
The prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant against the former Hakan Sükür strong-filled bull banker.
Accordingly, the southern opera is accused of being a member of a terrorist group, which now lives in America.
Sükür is to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, this actually has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The night "democracy wakes" in public places throughout the country has declared Erdogan to be over on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of the Besiktas workers' club are not traditionally among the president's friends.
What unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree on there - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At cup winner "Gala" it will be there again on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne-based company proved its sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 victory goal.
The newspaper "Fanatik" chewed him: "He was the best on the square."
He has finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also retired in the Europa League early.
In the Süper Lig it was enough to rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We have achieved that and that is the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game ended better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who is the base for the 14th with 26 season hits as a sunny goalkeeper king. title.
That is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florenz and loaned to Besiktas, had announced only after the coup attempt not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the trade magazine "Kicker" club director Fikret Orman.
However, the striker would have to be prepared to renounce around one-third of his annual salary, which is estimated at 7.5 million euros," Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay a salary at Florence".
Despite doping: These athletes still have medences at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Steponewa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had sued herself after a doping lock shortly before the games, was mercilessly whistled and bogged out at her start (100 meters of breast).
It had a bizarre scenery: she was still strutting into the hall with a smile and had provoked her performance.
When it was clear that she would not get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilestorm.
But there are numerous other athletes who start despite their doping past at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the number one in the world in 9.80 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit down a six-month ban in 2010 after she was detected to take the painkiller oxycodone.
She had had a severe toothache after surgery, defended herself by the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methyl hexanamin.
Perkovic contested the knowing commission and was suspended for six months.
The fourth litters this year are the largest gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and suspended for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world to date over 200 and 400 metres.
Ivan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete were revoked so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later after testosterone doping was diagnosed with it.
The now 40-year-old also had to relinquish Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the EM title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games because of a verdict of the CAS International Court of Sport.
At 80.04 m, it is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite were only tested positive in May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the ban on the world anti-doping agency WADA was mild and already ran on the 13th century. July off.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Thomas Schnöll, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Friday.
She had suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it.
She planned her journey home at the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected, is unclear for the time being.
In this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, said Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs had initially exploded in a night's quarter on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday, two IEDs were killed again on Friday, and according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the morning.
According to police, a taxi driver was injured during the detonation near the Patong beach, which is popular with holidaymakers.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed a city employee.
The IED, according to the authorities, went into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bomb attacks bear the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee on Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or with international terrorism.
"This is just local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received intelligence indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and the places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police ordered their officials across the country to strengthen the security around major government buildings, as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always small bomb attacks in Thailand, but they usually do not direct themselves against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the now bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to complete the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, there is no recommendation to these provinces before not travelling.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will allow the military to have great influence in the years to come.
Junta head and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military riot, which seized power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, keeps itself benefited from having brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not succeeded in taking control of the swaggered uprising of Muslim rebels, which has been simmering for years in the extreme south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Less than a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.
The right "identitarian movement" is targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see the 'identity movement' for clues for efforts against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, Head of the Democratic Press Agency, of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Immigrants of Islamic faiths or from the Middle East are being extremisticly defamed.
That is why we are now observing the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a grouping with French roots that has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through overforeignisation".
Constitutional advocates in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identities".
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitary Movement' try to pick up their target group where they stand," said the head of the EPO.
In general, extremists try to talk to them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists would do as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a nice advertising for your own thing.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That is dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts between the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no insights on this.
For the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist and becomes so extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not apparent.
With regard to the significant increase in the right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming, planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a nationwide or Europe-wide management of legal terrorism is not apparent.
The previous groups were born at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen said concern that many attacks were paid into account by people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That is the worrying.
Many of the suspects of attacking asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that had nothing at his care before with right-wing extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, elected the CDU, SPD or left, who then radicalised themselves through right-wing extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiro's Habe at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures at times.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.
In social networks, he then became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finishes his lead with a fall of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th quarter. Place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure who attracted the attention of the international media.
Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming better known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in ethylopias, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media described it as a "Robel the Whale".
Based on a "prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only struck with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race caused media attention.
Unforgettable was the performance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to compete alone in a preliminary round of more than 100 meters of freestyle.
Moussambani was cheered on Frenetically.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Trump does not see the threat of election defeat so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election as US president does not become, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He then go on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he doesn't really care: "Ultimately it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television channel CNBC.
If it didn't enough for him in the end for political correctness, it's fine, Trump said.
He named US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
More recently more resistance was formed within his party.
Post enters into trading with electric transporters
An electrical device vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The post office plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle as well.
The Group wants to start trading with the van shortly.
The Post wants to offer its electric transporters to the free car market from next year.
"We want to join the sale to third parties," said a post spokesperson on Friday.
For months, the company has been considering whether it is to sell its self-developed street scooters, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other companies.
Postal Board of Directors Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always inquiries, such as craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based company wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the post-owned production, the company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and include a complete changeover to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management steps after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann would be all the more uncertain the longer the success he promised fails.
Turbulence at the top of Nuremberg's market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of corporate management, the world number five in the industry is facing a new start in personnel.
At the end of the year, GfK CEO wants to leave the company.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert already departs with effect from the 12th century. September from the Supervisory Board.
The management of the board is already taking part in the executive board on the 1. The former member of the Executive Board of Gerhard Hausruckinger, informed the company.
He is to officially assume the function of a "Centre Speaker" until a successor to Hartmann was found.
The company cited "different views" to the long-term business policy orientation as a reason for the resignations.
A company spokesman did not want to name details on Friday.
Anyone who will become the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor circles stated on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed with the lack of successes in the restructuring that had continued to be lacking years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK trend since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad figures of GfK, every shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do it that way," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 following setbacks in the previous quarter.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable same quarter of the previous year.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales of EUR 222.2 million shrank by 3.4 percent.
The company's decline in the figure in particular had a negative impact on the profits in the second quarter in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, gave the Group a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight Injured
In the event of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Zurich district) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police told.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus from an Eisenach travel company had to avoid an approach to trucks, some of which were on the counter-road.
The bus came to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the Aurich/Wittmund police police reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the passengers.
Six ambulances and an emergency doctor's car came to the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back from a bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should be waiting for a substitute bus from the company.
The investigators asked the truckers and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are from 1. October 2016 for the sewage plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of previously 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an additional calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach district office found that under-coveries are held for these wastewater treatment plants.
Due to legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.
From 1. The citizens and the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach their walls deeper into their wallets on October 1, 2016.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market town was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercapes from the previous calculation period were also expected.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases on the grounds that all three wastewater treatment plants were relatively small facilities with a very low sewage attack, which is between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres per year.
Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the amount of wastewater in all three plants is declining slightly.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three installations had to be incurred to a considerable extent, not least due to their age, refurbishment and repair expenses.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical aeration system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater processing plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20 year old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch, and after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be dredged at the Lopp pond sewage treatment plant, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option was installed in order to be able to comply comply comply comply comply comply comply comply with the water law requirements.
Schmidt: "The advanced care and maintenance costs were included in these extraordinary expenses, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that the low wastewater accumulation in the three plants "fulfils the expenses for operation and maintenance".
In the past 20 years, the market town has been spared the market town from large maintenance costs for the wastewater plants.
In the opinion of stone houses, the situation for these facilities will continue to be precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the sewage association Friesenbachtal could not be expanded to include these facilities, because these facilities are enough.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.18% as measured according to CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2016 was -0.2 %.
In July 2016, the price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was seen compared with the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%),; leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell on clothing and footwear (2.2 %); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged, as in the previous month, with alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.
They can turn into a pineapple, dog or figure who could be from a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.
The filters are blunt, property-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, in which they were accused of promoting Blackface or promoting white skin as an ideal of beauty.
When it proposed a filter to some users this week that gave them slot eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow face."
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was voiced as a tribute to anime characters and not intended as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injuring clichés.
Others firmly refused to compare the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photos were widely used, wrote that the filter was "injured and unpleasant to say the least."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the pejorative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - could rather assume to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed than it used to be the case," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, deleteed her Snapchat account asked others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: 'DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they don't have a variety of representations of people with other skin colors in their staff, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something against it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a personnel manager who focuses on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said that she would leave her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military leadership falsify ISIS intelligence information, establishes Congress committee
U.S. State Central Command's military personnel changed intelligence information to create a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called. To draw the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed, a congressional committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a task force of Republican members of the armed force committee, intelligence committees, and the military budget committee, reports great discontent under Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"New Intelligence information, typically pulled out by senior Centcom commanders, regularly painted a more positive picture of America’s efforts against terrorism than allowing the actual conditions on the ground, and were consistently more positive than other intelligence analytics," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened with Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analysis presents to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors at Centcom extend to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that leaders in Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts felt exposed to the pressure of their superiors, to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts are true," the report stated.
For example, a member of the member publicly announced that a military reconquest could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed the intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the task force after they leaked that analysts were concerned about manipulating reports of the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation will continue.
In addition, further investigations by the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are underway.
Democratic members of the Committee of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the Republic Task Force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-restricted process for creating intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking Democrat in the Committee, Member of the Adam B House of Representatives. Ship, known in an opinion.
This process, says Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave excessive room for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of White House intervention among the Centcom analysts about a "determined political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's Inspector General, which was included after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on any Congress reports, while the inspection of the Inspector General was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have very divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have recussions beyond the issue of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The allegations of last year, however, have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes from more than ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the former government under George W. Contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, Bush provided for only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time committed to thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team headed by Mr. According to government agencies, hooker states that, contrary to government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this insight was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was killed at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel replaced.
The USA wins the fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is coming
One day after shooting three goals over Japan during a 6-1 win, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the American women won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows that: the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on par with the British women, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The UK and the United States will meet in the last round match on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the match will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each win first and second place.
The first-placed winner will avoid the strong Dutch women a little longer, who lead the other group.
Whatever the game on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising whirlwind with their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places in the last London games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in the first place at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), when she was 16 years old, became a US national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she did not qualify for the squad.
Then came 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig became an Englishman, coach of the national team, and things began to turn for a better time.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to snapp around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a backhand blow from the vicinity.
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled it in the middle and shook the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
It has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next Saturday game.
Amidst the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging relay race between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning staff, which is served by the crossbow shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the queue in the cake of your neighbour in the coffe shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is attending the Olympic Games for the first time and is a woman's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names, broadcast for prime time, built up by sponsors and wellness TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and we will reign for a long time.
But if I am humbly allowed to make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many people I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete who made it to the final round until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the innocuous ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of its never-wanting impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "springboard."
Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to face a series of moves (turning, pike and somersault) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be evaluated according to execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time".
Two-and-drawn athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straightforward.
Medal hopes must go further in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes way and back, up and down on the playground.
They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also another sneering goal in the television broadcast: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even tear a spectator.
But it is also what I feel myself considered something tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is at the top.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualifying and final tournaments will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will beaming the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the possibility and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tutres recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base, wrestling for air.
"A generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia were met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in the exchange of fire.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded into more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people stormed onto the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response has been ruthless.
Witnesses said that police shot and killed riots on tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video circulating about the protests that are probably from last or earlier this year shows security guards beat young people with sticks while they have been forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist droughts beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if anything, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the government's repression - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of simmering under the surface are now exploding.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But that is also changing.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The greatest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special representative to work on opponents and making them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take up Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such turmoil was 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which according to analysts were apparently botched by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in recent months, and this time of unrest went by relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government's internal resentment.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked businesses run by Tigray in Gondar, an American city, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common on social media.
Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by stating that his repeated repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group were not serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's communication skills, whether he was able to communicate with the American public in a clear and understandable way.
It also brings his competitors, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to have to explain statements that he might not have meant.
After he suggested at an election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump back regarding the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump, he is simply sarcastic.
The Tweet was unlike the previous day on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he said the accusation was completely serious.
As the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. The Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it to Obama ISIS.
The last storm of criticism rattles on Mr. Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling poll ratings.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. tried. Trump to return to this issue.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already shaped sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he made strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to be told Mrs. hack Clinton's emails, however, he later declared, "Of course I meant sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the linguistic borders in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clearly" depending on what the reaction fails.
But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.
Instead of alleviating the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his poll ratings have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a lead with a large lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
During Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstand his humor.
But while he is increasingly focusing on the attention of his presidential campaign in the last months, Mr. Trump’s jokes placed his loyal colleagues in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidates today in a Thursday CNN interview.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. So Giuliani he wants to the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements were asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbenchers, completely wrong, and it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the administration under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowing ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively bring the situation in the Middle East under control.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just one more proof that he is unsuitable for president.
Once driven by the price, Café in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.
The store Soap Cherie, the verb replaced in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Native people mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB dead, except the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is a soap shop now."
But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepted credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who owns and managing director of the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are toppings such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also replaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said.
"It became clear to me that it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"Well, after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything baggage with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he switches off his everything bag with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he did not hold a resentment about the soap business holding the old business space.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we will go into their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he planned to exhibit it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt had lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a soft spot for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as PÃate de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman tells the story of "97 Orchard" about life in a house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," which will be published by Harper Verlag on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatbacks, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Reich-rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinners.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Women's crews cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pate was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" marks the way the land was avoided by no longer being the land of milk and troe.
"It was a time when Essen became a central, tense issue for the Americans," Coe found why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mystery such as bread and casseroles became basic food, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food scraps," Ziegelman noted, since chefs could hide unsuitable ingredients under a crescent sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for many years was the focus of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out because a calorie and nurturing satisfaction took priority over taste or even common kitchen sense.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the midday," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many of the domestic recipes.
Like never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "women's household politicians" and to meet the challenge of transforming pampas such as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical treats.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Cake-Essen-Hocation are particularly attractive.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he was dining like the million-weight man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully unknown.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desperately prepared."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era of dealing with food was discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
The couple told how to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She was really afraid of waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the puff incident.
After the plates were cleared off at Eisenberg's, she and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give a modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone seemed a little reluctant to plunge into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe took a look three times.
Like a Can-do encyclor, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, has saved the lives of almost 60,000 people.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to move people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civilian guard showing him from the ruins of a house in an 11-hour rescue of an infant, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war.
However, as a hero, he never saw himself, according to the picture, said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die in saving lives, I think that God sees me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing raids in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now eliminating the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb had to affect terrorists.
Greenland Shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only get young talent at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims along the ground of the North Atlantic leisurely, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 metres.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this slow lifestyle seems to be a panacea for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" about a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.
"DamING," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are stone-calfed.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.
Nevertheless, these sharks make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of one seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ironing board and looking for carvers that torch down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, who brought Fischer from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitsbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens of the sharks.
This centre of the eye lens is formed even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests hurled large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the smallest animal, which is the third length of 220 centimetres, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to be 50 in its investigation in 2012. Birthday celebrated.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lens, which are created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four metres.
The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably sexually matured on the threshold and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously at least one and a half centuries can be achieved with the reproduction.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.
It is no coincidence that such methusies live in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon there was a 120-year-old harp tip on the neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a low-saving flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss from one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building base in a double pack
The municipal council focused on issues relating to building in the most recent meeting.
With relief, the committee included Mayor Robert Putz's announcement that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin".
After the property, parcellation and development issues have been clarified and the applications for surveying could be submitted, the sale of the plots in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (binder line - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building spaces in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and popular senior citizens alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to discuss the award of the parcels at its September meeting.
In order to be able to meet requests to settle further commercial enterprises, combined with job creation, the municipal council decided to amend the land use plan, which had been newly created in the spring of this year, in parts of the area.
In the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated industrial estate is being extended by two plots towards the state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of the Main therefore has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies that moved from London to jobs and companies in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets competence field.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial transactions can continue to operate financial transactions throughout the EU from London.
Approval in Great Britain has so far been sufficient for the so-called EU passport.
This is what large US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they are relocating jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
According to Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which brings together responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the largest banks in the euro zone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is making a big fund industry resident, it is taking a lower part in infrastructure, just like Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also scores with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it's not that easy to find free-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
Rents for first-class commercial properties on the Seine are 50 percent higher than on the River Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competition thanks to its good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less crime.
In a ranking by the consulting firm Mercer, the city is ranked seventh, Luxembourg in 19, Dublin in 33rd place and Paris at 37. Place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers think.
According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people in the banking industry were working in London at the end of 2015, compared with 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. office funnel ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by Hepatits C with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a cash payment of 200 million dollars for the infringement of two patents by Merck, which were in connection with the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When raising the lawsuit on Thursday, U.S. office staffman Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to issue the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which masters the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other and took advantage of the property on laboratory work that was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed troops say that they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-supported troops have reclaimed complete control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city have left these, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city after the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told the Manbij Military Council Reuters, allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are currently doing clean-up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which yielded an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband.
In 2015, Clintons donated USD 1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fee; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in office at the State Department.
Clinton's vice-president candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton published his tax returns over the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In a blatant contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated as a reason for his refusal to seek tax inspections by the tax authorities.
"They're on the train," Clinton's campaign helper Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, regarding the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate for 2012, have already announced that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charity, his business conduct, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already rushed to the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which highly renowned Republicans ask Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also raised the issue during a speech on business in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers on Friday saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals earn the more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its headquarters here, demanded Trump to meet at their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had "fear" to voters and not to the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published a tax return drop from 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of approx. 32% between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx. 40.5%.
The Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that they earned only USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clinton's dividends and income taxed USD 109,000.

Condoms with Chilipuder, firecrackers promote Tanzanias Elephant Protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms filled with Chilipuder.
The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for this, has intensified its promotion with US nature conservation years ago by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without hurting animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is a World Efficiency Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we ... Toolkit developed, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, whereby they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide's CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chiliwolous" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed into a condom together with a fireworks, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a pop and sprays fine dust at Chilipuder into the air.
A breath quite usually already out to drive out the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower, which shoots a gold rain fire into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No new kiosk on St. Goarer Rhine bank
Usually take the St. Goarer investment projects by traders with kiss – after all, the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"We generally welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit in," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU parliamentary group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli dials in frontion removed after "Arab" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after he had revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code because, according to an employee, Arab guests had "requested".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", vented his annoyance at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country code list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, in 2016 that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel via its own call centre.
Searching for a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked" as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the dialling code be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great disgrace," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater shame.
This does not need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the correct conclusions," said the minister.
The incident caused a rather great response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assume that the Kempinski Hotel had "mented" the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Sane," said another post, which indicated that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all accusations and called the incident an "oversight" and "was excused" with Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct statement," Israel did not include in the quick-election list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has been added now.
Police uses tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined forces with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students are being held to save money.
Some of the protest participants were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests occurred a few days after demonstrators took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to recall.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year with the lifting of the sanctions.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in businesses in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador announced.
Russian companies are making existing connections with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5 percent, amounting to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to 158 million dollars.
The trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is coming from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian mission foreign issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken last year, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl raided
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With the maintenance of a gun, three darkly dressed people who had covered their faces demanded the publication of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then flew first on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
The police do not tell how much money was captured.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards the B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations during the time of the crime (about 7:45 p.m.) that are related to the robbery should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: Fun and games at summer leisure
The children and young people spent eight beautiful and happy days from the socio-educational daily group/social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Association with their supervisors on their summer camps in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, Maulbronnn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip took to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splashing.
Children and carers were spoiled with their self-prepared funeral foods such as the albumers Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewellery was created from pearls and stones or a wooden game was made of a Roman-mill game.
Other highlights of leisure activities were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "color evening".
On the day of the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: pilgrimage to the gate of mercy
The altar servers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together four stages were mastered.
To bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all altar servers in expected two years, the Oberministrantenrunde St. Anna resolutely decisive in preparation and carrying out a pilgrimage lasting several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally opted for the episcopal city of Fribourg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening door of mercy at Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was required.
16 Minis made of Bittelbron, Gruol, Haigerloch and saint rooms set off.
The evening before, Father Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, bless the pilgrims' crosses and gave the blessings to the pilgrims.
From Horb, the train was taken to the Villingen starting point, where a diocese of Our Lady of Our Lady stands and thus the pilgrimage route was started by the Münster.
The individual day tours were each framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and scriptures.
But even on the way, the minis repeatedly rested at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from a specially put together pilgrimage song.
For the overnight stays, parish houses of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day the stage was stepped to St. Peter, who was the most strenuous route, had to descend around 500 meters of altitude in suspense with sultry heat and then climbed again.
The well-earned reward was a common barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter went to the final stage to Freiburg.
The Minis arrived at Freiburg Minster in the later afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy, visibly relieved and happy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in the Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scottish Callum Skinner storms home when Brite wins gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner rested on fame in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last evening, when the British team defended the London title in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had adopted. The youth pund made the legend proud when he stormed home to earn a victory from the favorites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the World Railway Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's retirement.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this show up in time as Hindes.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman, which has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first lap.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched as a BBC expert from his position and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "It is a flattering comparison."
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me.
We set an Olympic record in the final tournament and defeated the world champions.
It was just amazing.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "With the whole GB flags in the stands, it feels like London."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If the one barometer of our progress in the last five months is that successfully await us five days at the velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the realm of possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also on the 23rd place. March was born (a secondary holy date for the British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
This would be tantamount to that of Hoy.
Kenny will be next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I enjoy this just for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-point race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be the focus.
He had argued yesterday with representatives before qualifying, when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in a world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas took place in the background, said the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of accusations of sexism and bullying and retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition at the Velodrom, it looks like it as if the legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the Portland smelting plant due to the abolition of the energy contract questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium smelting in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus abolish all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to award any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect ones - could be at risk if they were closed.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelting shop, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelting plant in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.
This step follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is owned by a majority-owned joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelting plant," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security transactions", which should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from FY 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual admission of 187 million in "Expectation of a Notice".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability to operate Alcoas... the smelting plant or to ensure the power supply to the smelting plant" did not affect.
The US company said that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into effect from November this year, even if it still found a statement as to why it has resigned from the treaty.
Analysts warn about the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions in the industry.
With regard to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity and around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as an electricity generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and was shown at the fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz-oncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they have planning a surprise.
This is the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast slot at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were shown in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine’s September issue is a league in itself.
The September issue is the most sold edition for Vogue.
With a size that resembles a illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista was advertise from the 832 pages of the torch 615 pages).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked through before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "celebrities modelling" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the low chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she finds herself in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if it applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are excellent in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With her reality television history, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticizing them and called her "the crap pieces of the moment."
These feelings were cooking up again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on discontent seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
It runs for Marc Jacobs.
It promotes your priming by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her photographs of Cindy Crawford's subsidiary to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she can be seen on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community law centers select 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid most auxiliary centers are dismissed annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is preparing to have cut further funds on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly persons, immigrants, workers in need, victims of acts of violence and those who do not have any funds for unjust debait and the like - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services to the community, which are already underutilized, are getting ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queesland's common rights centres, James Farrell, said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centers revealed that thousands of people are already dismissed every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queenslands' community rights centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unmanageable and overwhelming debts, families who go through divisions, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Queensland Senators, to repeal these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered its commitment to increase funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal rights centers and their customer communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employees allegedly moved gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after it was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had targeted a gun on an employee in February while traveling in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in the state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's Kniekele," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he said in the indictment.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The charge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused an uproar when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and gunfighters - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite to violence.
Bordini's complaint claims compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was not available for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
No response was responded to calls to its consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll in front of country elections: SPD and CDU lose
At the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4. September) and Berlin (18. September) are experiencing considerable losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This was shown by representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north could barely continue to rule, according to the polls in Berlin, this is not possible.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would therefore only lag barely before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the state parliament with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are back into the Schwerin state parliament with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin Member State of the Executive Board (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would therefore be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time at 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss their entry, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in slow motion: The Nokia Communicator came onto the market 20 years ago.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was quite chunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on the 15th anniversary. August 1996, in the stores - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago, the communication was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as a "Office in the Pocket Format" office.
In fact, the new mobile phone could be used for standards of the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit agonizingly slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be expanded similarly like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could have guessed that the communicator would be the start of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The cell phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
To be online everywhere, today is for many people everyday.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, including 555 million units on Samsung and Apple alone.
Worldwide sales of the equipment amount to around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-changing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
An entire industry has now been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market did not come until the beginning of 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything easily operated via touch screen.
The triumph of Apple began, the iPhone is still the company's most important product today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had to look back.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying has now been Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
Today, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn how to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel on the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow's biggest attraction, just like in 2012 in London, when we put a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will happen again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will always create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the Heathrow expansion is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, €1.11 billion in sustainability growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment around the airport as well as across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented an infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, until the T2 built in the middle of the two busiest walkways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third run, supported by 16 billion dollars in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the addition of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we can direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England is proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and Mouse" regarding ad blocking
According to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking, companies that make money earn money come equal to a "stat and mouse game" according to one of the software manufacturers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it told users could update their filters in the program to block advertisements on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its ads to make it more difficult to detect display blocking over which part of the page advertisements is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to circumvent the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock's spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-here battle between the display-blocking open source community and the surroundings has been going on since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become to the industry.
According to a study from last year of last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers worldwide; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worthwhile to invest such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "Ad Preference Tool" to provide people with more control over advertisements targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook speaker in an email release.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we focused on developer tools such as ad preferences instead to put more control into people's hands.
Woman passing over on Swiss motorway in probable suicide
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police called witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of the morning hours on Thursday.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman laid out on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, the police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who asks them and any witness to the incident to come forward.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where a person in the dark one was running on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks on the motorway in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a negligent killing police officer was acquitted after she ransacked and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, heard the court.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified man and that the presence of a man on the street was a "fully extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident near Morges on Thursday should report to the police on the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dent atmosphere could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly continued to shoot.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet presumably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matt.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus is exposing its day side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously assumed by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus, like us know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letter.
Patrick Roy resigns as the Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy represented the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations and had a low right of codetermination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado's Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I have been thinking a long and a lot about how to improve this team to give it more depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have a right of codetermination when making decisions that influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, the Roy on 23. He had engratuated him on May 1, 2013 had thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his 2013-14 Avalanches season.
He took the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups –- two tracks featuring the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North water workers resume talks, strike
Labour struggles for remuneration for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all parties party disputes are setting themselves at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin early next year to restart the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's rate cut follows a 10% decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts gives the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has released thousands of people for him and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it streamlines its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had intensified by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than 1.4 billion dollars in expenditures for new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around 7 billion dollars in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotational rate of stars in the cluster of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why star clusters rotate at different rates and where the rotational periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which were formed around 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They are now spinning fastest.
These ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds at peak rotation rates.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Cluster of Star of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot to find out what we want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleiades rotation rates, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star steps down
The tears at Alex Rodriguez ran faster than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will be held on 12. August against the Tampa Bay Rays wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14th all-star game participant in Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
Since 2007, he signed a ten-year contract has earned him 27 million US dollars annually.
Until the end of the contract on 31st In December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with power.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he had achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
Nevertheless, the 41-year-old should not be accepted into the hall of fame of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, as controversial is his appearance outside the square.
As early as 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted that they had gained banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned from 211 games by the end of 2014 due to involvement in the so-called biogensis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to have received performance-enhancing funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the suspension was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league could have even done me a favour for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez smug at the time.
His farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends receive the big stage again in their recent games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," Yankees coach etched Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and who was said to be said to be relationships with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, were said to sympathy for fans from the Yankee-Arrangrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang against the Rodriguez team in the 4:9 defeat.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Consisting of: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter disruptive runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically edged athletics competitions, this news comes to the point of time.
At Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The CAS International Court of Sport confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final of over 100 m butterfly, but she missed the bronze medal by only 0.09 seconds.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-probe and a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the CAS International Court of Sport and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also during the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa leaked, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be supplements," explained the track and field athlete.
According to the report, the banned substance is about the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to the B-probe, the B-probe is said to have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately spoke up with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-contaminated nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also announced, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days before.
Both dispute the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian team from starting with one exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan Runner also produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In addition, the earlier crimes in China had caused fierce confrontations between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to borrow," Lacourt said on the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of an examination of the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and respect for doping fraudsters," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant Trimetazidin at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to serve a three-month suspension.
Data theft: So perfidies hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in this.
According to a recent survey by the malware defence specialists, malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed were at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes victims of an attack with extortioner software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already targeted ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize increasingly on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom to be blackened is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently seeing a frighteningly fast evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in a conversation with the "world."
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Private users were the first to go, but the switch to company attacks has been frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once a victim's computer actively searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as images and videos archives.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake among private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stands still.
Accordingly, the damage falls out when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported losses in revenue from ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business activities completely, in one case people were in danger of their lives.
In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks several times whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: do not pay, you are only promoting the problem," explains Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers at F-Secure have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the extortionists and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service to make more money.
They explain to their victims via chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free sample files.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware within about a week."
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software to the actual blackmailers in the form of a software builder.
The previous malware kits emerged by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price of between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The scope of delivery includes an customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
One therefore logs into one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers with their spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to defend against ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successfully recommendation, the perpetrators will instead face the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This makes the damage potential even more higher than before, depending on the type of data.
The perpetrators could also target completely new goals in the Internet of Things in the future.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat associated with the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating system for many victims could be worth a ransom.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything into the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 metres high, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not look narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well finished and look comfortable, only the cockpit top side drops slightly.
The HR-V in the storage space is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l at the disposal of high and 1026 l with around-folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The boot is well loaded, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre 88 kW/120 hp diesel accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he is likely to do his work a little more slightly.
The everyday use of 4.7 l/100 km is encouraging.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
All-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assist.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as "approximate objects" when manoeuvring.
The high beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed control responds to traffic sign recognition and, if necessary, we reduces speed.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, sat nav, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest that much, you will receive the gasoline engine from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile car suitable for everyday use.
Airline does not adhere: Crash on passenger boarding bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger boarding bridge.
The Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf (file no.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers typical of air traffic.
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: When pays the organizer
Sick holidaymakers only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family suffered from diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness attributed the holidaymakers to a defective sewage plant, which had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family believed that the trip was defective - and sued the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
However, the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure.
He had to assume that the seawater was fine.
He had therefore not violated his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to contagion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maiziere said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people are concerned about further attacks.
The state must react calmly and resolutely at the same time to terrorist threats.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this increases the security and also strengthens the population's approval for the refugee policy.
De Maiziere wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 federal election.
He also announced another staff reinforcement of the security forces, "in medium four-digit size over several years."
Advertise sympathy for terrorism must be a criminal offence again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve gun law in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is particularly difficult.
The recently much-discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be preserved after de MaiziÃ3re's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to help reduce the danger to citizens, he said, for example, with a view to psychological abnormalities.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care to be necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumatised people.
To pursue criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maiziere is planning the use of covert investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior had clearly opposed actionism.
"That was a slap in the face for the agitators in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maiziere had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on burqa and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considers a general ban on full shutdown to be constitutionally problematic.
You cannot forbid anything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
We could talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green head Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate energy and the ability to act with ever new counter-terrorist packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Full of sayings and an intensification of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly stames on the bypass road - here a picture from November.
But this is to change: the right-hand pursuit is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who stand in the traffic jam every evening during rush hour when travelling over the motorway feeder (A 43).
The regional road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17. August) in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Weseler Straße the right abbieers grab by 700 meters.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Road to the right.
The great advantage: Traffic is divided more earlier, which will improve the overall process on the busy section of the federal road 51.
The idea with the extended exit was made by the CDU faction in the Münster-West district representation.
The road narrowing on the feeder annoys drivers mainly between 5 and 19 o'clock.
On weekdays, the backwater extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the bottleneck on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only single-tracked via the motorway bridge.
The second trail had to be dismantled well a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy goods traffic in two lanes.
The responsible state company cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated jam will continue.
However, years can be expected: the bridge has an official reliability until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand pursuit, the state company has deliberately chosen the less traffic time during the school holidays, because disabilities are to be expected.
The traffic will be passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Events for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a presentation of the award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 pupils between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has been offering schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most young people in the class had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, between September 2015 and March 2016 and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will collaborate in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre games and theatrical language teaching are in the planning stage.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has put a brink on the night of Friday to the shooting star spectators in the southwest of Germany - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suitable for observing the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will certainly see many shooting stars in the sky.
The shooting stars are Perseids, which are among the fastest star scales at 26000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning there is no longer any sleep to think about sleeping in the morning before the alarm ring.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by it, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a disturbance of insomnia and sleep.
Many people in particular find things sleep through as they are unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German General Doctors' Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also drugs, can be found behind this.
Sleep disorder is not uncommon for another disease.
"Very early waking up is frequent, especially in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are dependent on each other.
Anyone who has a herniated disc, for example, can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you be taken with sleep disorders to doctor?
If you do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment may look very different: you are knocked off, tired, sleepy, have difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
To relieve sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behaviour changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any admitted sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of the Charité University Medical Center Berlin.
Therefore, one should first turn to the family doctor if you have sleeping problems, advises Weeß.
He can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause with examinations.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, for example, doctors advise snoring with breathing displacements, in pathological daywage fatigue, sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze explains.
You don't really need to prepare for the examination.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't stop at noon," says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose goggle, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get a grip on their problems?
There are quite a few adjustment screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts: regular sleeping and nightmares, not lying in bed for too long, do not sleep during the day, do not watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you immediately start to calculate, and that is not conducive at all.
What the jungle camp has to offer with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook to the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the World Short Course Championships in Doha, while at the same time setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has placed himself protective against his criticismed ex-team colleagues.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000€ and a jungle king 150,000€, nobody should be wondering about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday on Friday.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at or even do it when it comes to doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency (Bulgaria).
That is exactly how we should keep it with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period before WM/OS may not participate," demands the election hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlour.
Airport: gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian flags of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday.
The suspects had written several bags and luggage theft as a gang.
At around 9.30 p.m., civilian officials recognized a gang in the area of Düsseldorf Airport, which was known to the policemen from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July this year, taking action, division of labour and particularly professional.
The specialists of the crime detective 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had arrived in Germany specifically to observe crimes.
They had captured more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a remaining cobblestone street: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first glance, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
Someone has sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a grey house.
Compared to a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: a house with tall windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here by 2017.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: it was once occupied, in the meantime the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator Henkel in particular had spoken out in favour of a police force against the project on several occasions, describing the area as a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After on the 22nd For three weeks, the police patrolled the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three team cars on site, closed parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On the 13th In July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and local residents.
This summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before the Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Leftover violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a neighbourhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalous leftists.
The ditch that the Berlin Senator for Internal Affairs and the police set up between squatters and their neighbours does not appear.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Occupations and the residential projects born from it have also been part of the neighbourhood for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Riganians.
While the Mainz Railway stations had been cleared under a large police battle in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners from all over the world in recent years: residents from the GDR era and former squatter are now sharing their neighbourhood with them.
This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent for new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga residents are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognised by thrown-in panes or freshly painted facades that were painted with paint bags.
No other street was mentioned so often this year, along with the words "left-handed autonomous force".
One reason why not all neighbours consider this a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, according to statistics, statistics are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes constitute damage to property, which tended to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they certainly did not.
Even the famous burning cars have not been around directly in the Riga resident for a long time.
For the trained architect, her street is not a criminal hottest, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved to Rigaer Straße and remained.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of interpretation over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as new-growers, the streets will continue to be taken away from them: through viewless new buildings in former vacant lots that displace the old residents.
"In the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people live here, more who are not so well affected," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what to do if no one listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for migrants who are annoyed by colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.
Anyone who moves should be aware of it - just like someone who goes into a pub quarter, can complain about noise there badly.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.
She is also the local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social teacher supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, the refugees working group on refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else who is involved.
Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg legendary wool milk sau, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less spotting than at the large number of areas of desired tasks had said - when the administration wanted to postpone the position.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-laying wool milk sow.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organizing, working with the local people and also behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has limited a 50 percent position at three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, saying that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be shown in Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find housing for the connection refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection storage.
They must place the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The costs for the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has proven to be very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It has not yet worked, said Deuschle.
Therefore, community apartments must be upgraded, as it is called.
So soon new containers will be installed in Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is not enough.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, schools, one-euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no occupational therapy".
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People would have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers are also stepping in here.
It is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and that they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach is not allowed to work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, customer honestly says, "people who are not possible with anything." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: do the two fear of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer very clearly, "what some may call naive". However, a residual risk cannot and does not want to rule out.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.
They are afraid that the attackers will bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So local and volunteers have to look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new plunge of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly is the policy.
Actually, it is unfair to put them helpers on site.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach where we wanted to reach," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the existing people properly.
This is currently around 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
