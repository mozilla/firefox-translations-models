Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered, as reported by the statistical office of the EU in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have assumed only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the Leitzsins. In their discretion, the interest rate cut, rising commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment would encourage the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least just under the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a quandary: inflation must be "agreed" in order to rule out the need for action at a later date.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a record twelve-year high in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the Eurozone are the increased food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat prices rose 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Edible oil and dairy products also rose considerably in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate, but put the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while support for the Socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among voters loyal to the party, the difference is clear thanks to the strong determination of opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one-fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, the MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry hurdle: they come to two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, overall economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who rate the country's economic situation as "decidedly bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "pretty bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one-tenth expect an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the prime minister's work as "rather bad than good."
Thirteen percent of respondents have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared to 27% distrust of the Fidesz leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who believe that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be brought under control without a change of government.
After the unrest last October, 35% were still in favour of keeping the government and the head of government, but today this share is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would "certainly" participate, and another 20% would "probably" cast their vote.
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would "certainly" go to the polls, another 15% consider their participation "likely". In view of these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Divided into the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty", the shares of opponents of tuition, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84 and 89 percent respectively.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles in Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of over HUF 1,000 were registered in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets "galloped away" last December, inflation has not been drastic in percentage terms compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it is certainly a deterrent to consumers that what they paid well below HUF 9,000 for last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic HUF 10,000 mark by at least HUF 91 in the markets studied.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1kg of bread rolls for 139 forints.
There was no competitive drop in the price of the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola returnable bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in this year's "Napi" shopping basket comparison, Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping basket by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year's cheapest basket and this year's most expensive basket was 12%, while the increase between last year's cheapest basket and this year's most expensive basket was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forints, but the VAT increase made itself felt in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that hit retailers hard: it seems that department stores could not really decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, as the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were incalculable.
(If the retailer plans the velocity of a product poorly, he can fall by substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the inflation of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
A comparison of the last two Christmas seasons showed a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some staple foods, the Statistical Office found inflation of more than 30 percent over a period of 12 months.
In addition to flour, this also applies to eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive in the previous year, has risen by little more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass on the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; There are constant reports of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices at all.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, non-perishable food is sold in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless queues at the cash register in all three department stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters that they can not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, savings are being made on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to containing the infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, savings are also being made on disinfectants.
The traumatology department of János Hospital was recently diagnosed with MRSA infection.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation could not be performed since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
As of December 10 this year, 1094 infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, but the number of unreported cases is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one-third of people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as strep throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria develop from the well-responding bacteria, which spread quickly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune systems, but also in older or low body weight patients, these bacteria can cause serious infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, said Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks during care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment," says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are tested for MRSA when they are admitted to hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals are preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for containing the emergence or spread of the multidrug-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the admitted patients and isolate MRSA-infected patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies from the state health insurance for this examination.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug from developing, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
Among outpatients or primary care patients, microbiological sampling is even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Savings are made on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by nurses.
This is precisely why hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds are tightly strung together, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately it even happens in the financially less well-off hospitals that savings are made on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that promote the development of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for health insurance companies, so they are being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
According to initial indications, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made the prevention of the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death Leader Police Chief Was Not Drunk
In the case of the fatal car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official report is now available.
The now-retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither drunk nor under the influence of drugs, Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for Budapest's chief prosecutor's office, said on Friday after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The former police chief turned into Kossuth Lajos Street in his own car in the XXII district and ran over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the driver, even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra crossing, has priority.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday. The money is to flow into education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental projects financed with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement for EUR 100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement deals with the use of the amorous EUR 200 million.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be used for the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; a decision on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be taken later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties have signed an agreement worth EUR 50 million, which will mainly be used for research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-linked, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is paying close attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the cheapest market in the EU, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most sought-after place for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the bestsellers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the very favorable area of Ruse will also attract more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - retail and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfers' paradises, attracting tourists in the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also want to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski resorts are dominated by Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are very important, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming more and more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 percent.
Inflation in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali roadmap, which sets out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
A fierce debate is currently underway between developed and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on assistance to developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be administered by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN's Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate action and reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister stated that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" was successfully reached or not. The Union would even be prepared to push for a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world or developing countries are also prepared to meet their obligations to the best of their ability and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its 15 member states at the time, had already committed itself to a minus of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, according to the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction plans set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also stressed by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN that was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in its latest report.
This would delay emission reductions and increase the Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, with extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video portal in order to increase popularity.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Since March 2006, special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban on the Internet, reports the BBC.
The footage, shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, is checked at the Kandahar air base and then sent to London, where it is posted on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, and their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeepers (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of the foreign missions.
Such published propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television commercials, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the raison d'être of the government's military measures in their own way.
Americans advertise with games
But the army also has to fight against amateur footage that, in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, also makes it onto the Internet - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are only talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Incidentally, numerous videos shot in action from the war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "species" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with raffle and pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a working conference at which her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and gossip.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up Christmas spirit with raffles or toasts to the hearts of civil servants.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - that's how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already reached the offices.
The largest Christmas party of a ministry will be held this year in the defense department, but not the employees of the ministry are expected.
At the "Christmas Party of the Orphans" children of fallen soldiers are given presents, at the "Mission Celebration" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are entertained, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department is providing around 25 million euros for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are going overboard.
The 4.32 million forint Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
While the focus of the festivities will be on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The hall rent amounted to 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas party organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the comedy theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible persons.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was said: There was no ball gown or suit obligation at the ball.
The ministries of health, labour, and self-government are each preparing for a puritanical celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially does not invite her employees to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
It is expected that there will be about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - will only be served coffee and poatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forints.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own ballroom, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were estimated at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception followed by a toast.
Since the beginning of János Veres' term of office, PM staff have celebrated in this way every year.
However, there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration has been scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on 20 January, the Christmas party of the Ministry is cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in the City Park ("Városliget"); According to the department, the expenses are estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and end with a reserved feast.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Museum of Decorative Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordinating committee on Friday for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the work stoppage begins.
Significant traffic disruptions are expected due to strikes, as rail traffic will be almost completely suspended, and the Budapest Public Transport Authority (BKV) will also strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday's strike will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, which will be responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday onwards, all organisations that have joined the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it comes only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight to the vote on the health insurance law.
Due to the strikes starting on Monday, considerable traffic disruptions will have to be expected: the railway workers will stop work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be at a standstill.
At the same time, there will be motorway closures in one direction in many places.
The call for a strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organisations have announced strikes indefinitely, others are planning a temporary work stoppage.
By Thursday afternoon, no agreement had been reached between Hungarian Railways MÁV and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are travelling by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, there are strikes at BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA unions for electricity and heat energy stop work for four hours, and the teachers' union bwz. the Democratic Teachers' Union have called 2- or 2-8-hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association goes on strike at different times across the country, while the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Care Workers, a subsidiary of SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and present a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Demand number three is that eligible professionals should be given access to the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provoking such a conflict, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of political leaders: "Public figures have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups, who have now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian antagonism".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The Research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, have "significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the upswing, so that since the summer of 2007 several organizations calling themselves "National Self-Defense Association" have been founded.
"What these groups have in common is that they define themselves as a civilian organization, while openly bragging about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (civil protection, national defense, law enforcement), citing the unsuitability of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: All this is done according to the method that tries to camouflage various political aspirations based on the political and party disenchantment of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association therefore serve not only to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration with the court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and some ultra-nationalist politicians from neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region," it said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, thus the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background to the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU took the incidents as an opportunity to establish the National Guard, arguing that the organization's goal was "national protection."
In their opinion, a veritable "gypsy terror" has been noticeable in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to Political Capital's risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news bureau: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports are published annually, and if risk-changing trends are discernible, public opinion is informed, as in this case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of rescheduling the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year will bring us fewer such days.
In the EU and America, too, "holiday" is understood differently.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve revelers can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are March 15, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, the commemoration day of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August the founding of the state is celebrated, on 1 May the work, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the long weekends, however, is that we have to work or go to school on the Saturdays before.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, should finally be processed, has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
The only exceptions are companies and institutions in which operations continue without interruption, i.e. even on public holidays.
This year, the work order is only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From 24 December, life in this country literally stops, as most people take time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specially cancelled holiday.
Next year, more holidays will fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer rescheduling of working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned upside down" around Labour Day so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day so Friday 2 May can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling is related to the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October, Friday, 24 October will have to be processed in advance.
The end of the year, however, will be completely dominated by the holidays, after from 24 December everything remains and stopped, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six daunting little things to annoy work colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or do you better face the challenge and try to deliberately avoid these misleading, annoying situations for others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting as a result?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it by perhaps calling the marketing department and ruefully admitting that you forgot to get the message across (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can use to give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowed something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it is gone?
Or will the lost ballpoint pen be discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they realize that something has come away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-its from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you: none there anymore, if you need it urgently.
Gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop gossip that has already been created.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
If possible, you should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of your colleagues to everyone's nose!
And if someone does open up and tell us his innermost secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to remain silent like a grave instead of aligning those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call the office to call in sick, citing excruciating headaches, because you feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, urgent errands, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by your colleagues instead of you.
So don't play alike your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could interfere, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in good time so that neither your colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Humming, giggling, talking on the phone
You are currently engrossed in your work, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud giggles of your colleagues?
Unintentionally overheard a telephone conversation that should not have been heard?
You should not annoy your colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), trampling, constant scolding or nagging.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not immersed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are others always to blame?
If a project is not finished on time, if you forgot to send an important letter or important messages, you should not blame others for your own forgetfulness!
If possible, you should not talk yourself out of the chaos in the office or the noisy colleagues!
It's best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were also affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for what was missed, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slippers: Comfortable for home, but has no place in the office!
Not even then should you dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody comes out of the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene did not spoil us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar equiche is "in" again, the domestic electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, played in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because an inn cannot tolerate two pipers - began to go his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he made but only after the request to compose the soundtrack to a film, he had been approached (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially performed in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and named Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only trendsetter marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but nobody cared if they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - the influences of rock'n'roll stand out.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
One song from the album has even made it to a radio hit - mr2 Petőfi, who has recently started broadcasting pop music from morning to night, has successively set the catchy tune for listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two castes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but it can also be produced only for sale that turns it into commercial music.
Even a good pop number can arise from an honest motive.
The receptiveness of the listener also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more closely because they also consider them a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it's a good feeling to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
For us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow Yonderboi's example?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his own way, quite apart from the fact that people always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust in each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi's were inevitable, as several of us come from his band and have taken a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is at the top.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening deliberately staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would serve as a driving force for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of assembling the choir from talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir came into being - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then aptly christened "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The number had been around in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number "needs something".
The chord sequence literally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody that same night, later the girls learned it.
It all came practically right away and frighteningly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but it also took the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo by Judy Jay), they have no role of their own, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also at the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were at the back was due to purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to give them solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where we went, let's just let these particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none at all, there were rather more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove did not work for a long time, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes constantly with the concerts and also now that I have "let go" of the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Bottomless scammer
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka, describes his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
It came because of him by almost five billion euros.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same as his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But as can be seen from Kerviel's statements published in the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, he was a person who made profits of 1.6 billion euros from his businesses at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He had already spotted the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already initial news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who have previously had repayment problems, would get into trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and was right.
At the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents so that he would not be found out.
He even managed to deceive his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid of being exposed?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"From my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
He earned a lot with Allianz shares by betting half a billion euros on the price losses of this stock in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, people closed their eyes."
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find out about him?
Suspicious, he made himself through a vacation.
"I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to look into his hands," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to get to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission yesterday signed a total of nine development programmes, through which the Czech Republic can reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns) over the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Enterprise and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion at its disposal next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and firms attract funds for innovative ventures.
The aim is to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In terms of money acquisition from EU funds to date, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan court upholds twenty-year prison sentence for ex-president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is back behind bars, according to the news Agency AP is currently unclear.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court proved four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money ended up in a fund Alemán set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget has been approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget drafted by this government, which was adopted by the coalition majority without opposition support.
It for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats), because it had been presented by Minister Sobotka (from this party), and the ČSSD could not afford to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies calmly approved this traditionally neglected, yet highly significant law.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is obscured by the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is a more rewarding topic for the media, and that is why they are paying more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
In previous Social Democratic governments, national budgets suffered from three weaknesses that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate all at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are mandatory by law, not only pensions but also social expenditures decided by the "tacit" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the fiscal deficit as a consequence of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and very much under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to attract sources of investment in addition to taxes, levies, and bank loans, often issued ill-considered debt securities that excessively indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other utility networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now this source has already dried up.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
For several years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth, of which the ČSSD boasts incessantly.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments indebted the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly due to previous governments.
We are among the countries least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for wet social programmes, which unfortunately have been inflated to a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even though it has been possible to eliminate some of the nonsensical populist spending passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no postponement of the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually all politics in this country will end and, no matter who is in power,  he will be left with nothing but pure administration.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become civil servants who mechanically divide most of tax revenues between pensions and social spending.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want ruling politicians to become mere administrative officials, then we must be patient and wish for calm in the preparation of further reform laws to this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect in taxes and fees.
Only these make it possible to gradually achieve a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to overcome the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction off interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, and loosening another $24 billion for the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to avert or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This move is intended to address the economy's biggest difficulties, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unserviced loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions in losses.
"Central banks must have been really afraid of what else could do when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, lending will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
Central banks decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in lending money between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further cut in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is heating up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the US housing market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are implausible
Global climate change supposedly hurts developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the UN international conference on climate change in Bali, which is coming to an end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he explained that the ecologists' debates were implausible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a firework of words that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
At the presentation of his book, the Czech President emphasized that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book was published in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
Now interested parties could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient qualifications to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and assessing technical treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main message of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate,  superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably burdensome.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, which he sees as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly declared that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and return."
Klaus had already spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driving licences
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
The ministry, however, does not fear that after New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid driving license on the roads.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive have not exchanged their driver's license.
While small towns report a sharp drop in interest in exchanging driving licences, the capital's offices are being inundated with applications, and interest in the exchange grew even further this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
The issuance of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the issuance with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to complete the mandatory exchange by the end of the year and drive off without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also leave it with a warning for the violation.
In case of violation, the penalty can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the municipality may also impose a penalty on those who do not drive at all.
He could, it was said, face a fine of as much as 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to show leniency and impose a maximum fine of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand-crown fine.
The driving licence is a document in which anyone can decide whether he wants to possess it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should surrender their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 expire.
However, motorists will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years left to exchange them.
Driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this involves about 2.6 million more driver's licenses.
Court lowers sentences for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, accused of colluding with David Berdych's gang, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced her sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" were threatened with 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this case, but he first faces the first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he had already received sentences totaling 16 years.
He cannot be sentenced to more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today heard the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, in consultation with, among others, Berdych criminals handed over information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped members of the gang evade prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the loot.
The indictment concerns crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also arrogance of office and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser scope and a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robberies.
Apart from nearly 20 men in the trial, courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet reached the court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have so far escaped trial.
Children swapped - bill: 12 million
For the substitution of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns in compensation plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each pair of parents.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, therefore strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's hearing.
"But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the expert opinion that the other side had prepared.
We will see if it has any significance at all.
But we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone together," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jabloňov family wanted one million crowns for every month they did not raise their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The children's parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying severity and depth, according to professionals in the field of psychology and psychiatry.
The men tolerated the stressful situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the mix-up of the newborns.
The women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the after-effects of the trauma they have experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola swapped nurses from the maternity hospital in Třebíč on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district governor of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands (Bohemian-Moravian Highlands) gave each family 100,000 crowns as compensation for expenses incurred by them due to the mistake of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district's control.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for help from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka was deprived of his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the trademark "Kingdom of Wallachia".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Wallachian king", but the project had been built up over many years by a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate parasitically in Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the hearing.
Everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian when they heard the words "Wallachian Kingdom".
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a dispute over money.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could also benefit from it.
They want to gain parasitically from our work," he said.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Wallachian king" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, this was not related to the intention of founding a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then followed the foundation of the company "Wallachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered her owners discounts on visiting his farm and his theatrical performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš was only using the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the program "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project is Harabiš and his team, who have devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the now divided parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to pile up, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected indefinitely".
At the suggestion of Harabišs, Jarmila Šuláková took the leading role as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and half a princess.
A new king was to emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and a date yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal parade in Wallachia.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also sign up," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Presets are dwindling
To tell the truth, I've never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The station wagon with the designation SW is still a bit further, and all that remains for me is to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the lack of headroom in the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Continue quickly
I only go through the interior for a short time so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design, where I only have objections because of the miserable center tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and gone are the days when we might complain about seats or headrests that were too short.
The lateral support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as the space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom is eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the hinged rear window) as very easy to load and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic configuration, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle in this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we notice that the Peugeot lags behind by a noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I have to mention the very flat cargo space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading sill.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kW.
And honestly, this is what a 1600cc engine should look like, powering a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes looks as if his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled with him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly folksy.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The Premium equipment of the test car once again beats with 80,000 crowns in addition.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, power windows rear and and...
So the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but add up the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So all that remains is to decide which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools are even noticing cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools is aptly illustrated by the case of North Kent, where clashes between natives and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Quarrels, harassment and scuffles among students have spread to relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed to such an extent that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks towards the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus shelter and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students told The Times newspaper another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited testify to the fact that the mood between natives and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In Great Britain, 70,000 Slovaks are registered as coming here in search of work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream, and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the very end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, skyscrapers grew, cars drove along the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
Hotel Nacional's bar serves cocktails to your liking.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Havana may be very run-down, especially its oldest part, but nowhere else can you find so many wonderful colonial sights in the vicinity as here.
Other places are currently being spruced up, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk that is unique in the world and attracts above all railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives whose peers have long been in museums elsewhere.
Destinations
The majority of visitors to Cuba do not miss the most important places.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It only remains to mention that in the already mentioned estate of Hemingway there is a museum, which those who like this writer should not miss.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, fertile soil accumulated in their cavities, through which even weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet it when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and fortune.
The wealth was embodied in the pretty beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that even in the fifties of the last century there was no road to connect the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to the fact that it went unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon to visit Trinidad, it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the "Valley of the Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly, this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included in its World Heritage List by UNESCO thanks to the untouched nature there.
This is where the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the Cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the voyages of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, now Hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about Santeria, an African religion professed by the descendants of slaves, you could write many pages about all this.
But, as they say: Better look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment are influencing the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to their ideas, the representatives of the countries stationed in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO forces to be more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid.
"There is a sense of progress in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached its highest level in five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand by as much as sixty percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We're going to have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the near future and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made a similar statement today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan idleness exposed: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post, which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Sovereign debt will soar to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to go into debt this year with 159.2 billion cones.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they rose by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech owes 84,000 crowns.
Over the entire past year, the state went into debt by more than 111 billion crowns.
"So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we may not exceed the one trillion crown mark until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, takes a similar view: "We could exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he noted.
Debts are growing
The public debt stems from the debt of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits of the state budget.
The sovereign debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Meanwhile, domestic public debt rose to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
Meanwhile, the state's foreign debt rose by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot considering how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that the increase is mainly in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of the national debt for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of the state budget policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will apparently reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
In addition, there are a maximum of 13.3 billion crowns for the consolidation agency, a ten billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and instalments for the bonds at the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion.
For giving a teddy bear a name, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan of insulting Islam, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and then expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be flogged.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Khartoum's Unity High School, was picked up at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Muhammad as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My Name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not carry a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simply that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she had never done anything to offend her to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teacher's students, who describe her as very attentive to her students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Consider that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common middle name in Great Britain, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
In the end, the failure
Kosovo's Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies over the separatist province's future status.
It is regrettable that the parties could not come to an agreement on the status, said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and to continue talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are clear tensions.
End of conciliation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which brings together the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian-speaking, could become clearer when Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika was mandated by the UN last August to remediate.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, an amicable solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration, Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is prepared to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, announced the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where these last-chance negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that compromise should always be sought and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade says that it is particularly afraid of a "domino effect" in a region that is still weakened by the wars of independence of the 90s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be taken solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
Kosovo's parliament will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that Kosovo's parliament would have the final say on status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would take place in coordination with Western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference held under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement to the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term encompasses the three major problems around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homes, which is now the State of Israel, in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the American president, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly, and that he provide a settlement on all points, listing Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security, among others.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged to ensure that the coming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to conclude them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the end of 2008 to implement his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it received an assurance to that effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries offering peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Polzei (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km / h, without blue lights, explains a spokesman for the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, i.e. not released for public road traffic (see below), came driven by two teenagers without helmets, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after disregarding its right of way, a police officer said.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers was much negative.
The condition of the car (dented fender, splintered windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main public security district management of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excludes the investigation of the IGPN at this stage the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this moped came relatively quickly to their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footpegs on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained entangled in each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumour quickly circulated that the police had left the scene of the accident very quickly, and that without helping the two teenagers.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigation, and which requires a very careful approach.
Libération met an eyewitness of those few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness says.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely distraught policeman limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth spoke on the phone.
In view of the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue workers arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire brigade came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken as part of the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the meeting.
Further demonstrations took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers' movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president called on the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken out against the state of emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the days that followed, he had to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct ballot on October 6.
The Chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
Everything we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to relinquish command of the army and become a civilian president no longer applies since the declaration of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by Nov. 15, the date when his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or IUD, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed better fertility control.
In any case, eight out of ten births today are carefully planned.
For one in five couples, even calculated exactly to the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season when it seems most comfortable to have a child.
Spectacular repair to the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar panel, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the distance of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized and the tools made by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred Wednesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon house European and Japanese science labs.
This module is a kind of jetty for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the crew's second task was to move a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew set about restructuring the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordions, was damaged by a trapped cable over a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped so as not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the space shuttle Discovery for a patrol and then repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-meter remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle, which had been attached to that of the station, to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, resistant, very dexterous, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to operate on the injured solar panel.
After inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rails to the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second Spacewalker, who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with an insulator to prevent electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had been conceived and tinkered with by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today, expected to make the return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After announcing that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to address the A400M backlogs, EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 in reference to the backlog caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance (EBIT) targets for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, he added, without further details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, EADS' business performance fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, that of the very large A380 carrier aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
Choosing the Status Quo
On Sunday, the counting of the ballot boxes will not be exciting: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very sealed election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to voters broadcast on public channels, which has already been recorded but whose contents are kept secret.
He is doing so in his capacity as the leading candidate of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is on the horizon.
Yesterday, when he received the foreign ambassadors, the president revealed nothing and was content to provide a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have made a mistake.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by repression.
Communist leader Guennady Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, who had been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these suspenseful parliamentary elections, two much broader questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Chairman of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have retained the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back even further: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, Putin has returned to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully embraced by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility they briefly displayed after the collapse of the USSR.
Why think twice?
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) head the local electoral lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 90s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why think twice?
Those in power are not so bad, why replace them?
A heavy souvenir
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents in the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen over a total length of 27 km, have not yet been inspected, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. by query of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states responsible for its administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the USA – agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
Now that the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been in force since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers, explains Reto Meister, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as, for example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal enquiries.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, declared in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Last April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros annually, Daniéle Smadja, chair of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that mutual trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday about curbing the current recurring concern about credit terms, announcing an offer of ten billion pounds with a base interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
In order to alleviate fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to suspend a significant proportion of its savings during the maintenance period, which begins on 6 December.  in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, she says in a statement.
The bank further explains that in this way, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has put liquidity into circulation for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it stands ready to take further measures to maintain the interest rates of the interbank loans, which vary from day to day, with their base rate.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, stood at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees that had discouraged banks from using them.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the movement of the pound exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous interest rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was drafted in the context of a socialist niche (meeting initiated by a parliamentary grouping), listed about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the PS National Committee, most of them 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP flottante, a transport cheque or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes violent exchanges between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television report on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present all its proposals as an amendment to the draft law on the correction of finances, which was examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer cancels the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a role model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 said on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer camping vacation destination.
The festival will probably take place from August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people a year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever attended, says his company and Melvin Benn's are working side-by-side to bring the area a European-style festival event.
"We chose Philadelphia as the market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
We were negotiating with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
"Unfortunately, we are stuck in political debates about the current administration," Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought Lollapalooza back to life in Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after making its mark in the world of festivals in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated gross tax receipts of $9.8 million and $11.8 million respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in one way or another, to merge these two concepts to give the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban festival in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is delighted to shoulder the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but confirms "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to include a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's capacity is "very large," roughly equivalent to the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences," says Charlie Jones.
His partners in C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal when none other than the Terminator opposes it.
These attempts at lure are part of the delegates' tasks.
A politically "sensitive mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
"You have to be careful because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones you think are the best," he says.
The run on the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the top priority at the moment is to advance cinema there.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market facing a year-end rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the coming end-of-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that, statistically, the month of December is usually accompanied by a positive market performance on the stock market.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine current market developments.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the liquidity given by the market and market participants. Due to the lack of safe equity funds, they invest mainly in bond funds, which are strongly affected by the appreciating trend towards high-yield assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will show a more lateral price trend influenced by market fluctuations, mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased price of crude oil and the risk of an increase in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its peak of 15,945.7 points on 8 November.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could end the year successfully with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidy of the pension fund at this time every year.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that things could develop a little differently this year; especially due to the end of the year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridging day on Constitution Day.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values that should drive the Ibex to new heights.
Solana from Intermoney asserts that this year it is the turn of the big values.
Among the value winners, the expert would count the two big banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be linked to the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally does happen, real estate companies will benefit from it.
ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path.
With regard to the increased consumer behaviour during the Christmas period, periodic consumption will determine market activity in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only present in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December showed only two cases of falling prices.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-of-year rally to date.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 caught up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a year-end rally remains to be seen.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the economically strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first banking group to take the plunge to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on weekdays and from 10h to 20.30h on Saturdays.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in its branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The bank's ongoing negotiations with the unions appear to be aimed at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will close on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, although not to customers.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business hours, will depend on Popular Bank's experience.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can accommodate the eager buyers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
To this end, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones, while at the same time adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
The bank's representative, Ángel Rivera, assures that the restructuring does not require major investments, but would be accompanied by increased recruitment, as a branch now needs eight or nine employees instead of six.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine stores in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía streets have been chosen for this, which seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA will not be used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to compete with our customers, Rivero explains.
They have provisionally reached an agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the close of the market. The station he headed had increased its value twice that of its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: This is exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not sunk too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday up 2.54%.
This gain reduces his losses so far this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the goodwill now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the bulk of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has posted a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to half at 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2,518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually operate on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level still seems uncertain.
Telecinco announced a week ago its intention to become the first television channel this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues. This was assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net revenues increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of trading (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the television business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor for Telecinco's comparatively better stock market performance in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show to date: In 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarría initiated a 100 percent dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of Endemol's shares, with Mediaset as the parent company, the ratio could still vary, although it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that this year we can satisfy our shareholders, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of Endemol's shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing certain tendencies of losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and sustainable potential and therefore recommends buying both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: gives Telecinco (buy) a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the multiple incentives and the prospering market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends lowering expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and deteriorating economic climate)
The Congress approves the MIFID directive, which came into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary draft, which ended today with the congressional resolution in the Senate on the additional/absent amendments associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing both regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the members of Congress and the Senate, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, MIFID, which redefines the Investment Services Regulation, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control rights of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to provide financial advice to specialised firms as well as to natural or legal persons and also contributes to the creation of new Financial Services Companies (ESIS), the advisory firms that merge with investment and brokerage companies in securities.
It also expands the number of systems for executing financial transactions, so that multilateral securities systems and systems for internationalisation of orders to trade are added to regulated circulation markets, which would eventually compete with current economic players.
The law obliges investment companies to communicate on the market the focal points of their company profile, confrontation and ways of dealing with risks and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's supervisory task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress provided for further changes in retrospect, whereby the decision that the bonded bond must now be regarded as complex financial resources due to its high level of risk for the investor has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the directive was used to legally limit the areas of work of qualified economists; 30 years after 1977, the regulation restricting the areas of work reserved for economists was issued.
For its part, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the business mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can simultaneously offer his services for the commercialization of products and customer acquisition to several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator, which Eurostat uses to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union, provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare location and quality with US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made ahead of time by using the same procedure as the harmonised index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the premature indicator was only indicative and therefore did not have to be consistent with the final result to be announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Pedro Solbes, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance, the increase in the CPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain's inflation differential with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year due to the crisis, and they now amount to only 12,000 million pounds (equivalent to 16,800 million euros).
At the time, the bank's assets amounted to a record £25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably in two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and will continue to decline until the end of the crisis, despite the government's one-hundred-percent guarantee that the money is safe.
Virgin, which would continue to operate the group under the Virgin Money brand after the takeover, will have to bring in about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will consist of investments over the next three years, to acquire exactly the £18 billion still needed to reach its target of £30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to invest £50,000 million (equivalent to about €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve his goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested this morning the current mayor of the municipality of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, on the strong suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, currently a deputy for the Partido Popular and then chairman of the Totana municipal council, and could be the original mastermind of the plot, according to Cadena SER.
The officers continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week, has been accused.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore privileged, MP Juan Morales was arrested as he left his client's residence on the basis of important incriminating documents allegedly related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report Morales' alleged contract payments to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidacy in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will head the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, if the Socialists win, will assume the office of congressional president.
This is what José Blanco, PSOE secretary of organization, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified, since it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the politician from La Mancha would apparently run for president of the congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as congressional president. He had announced last 15 November that he would no longer stand in the next general elections, end his career in public politics and instead work for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had continuously pushed for his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, calling this an act of transparency.
If he actually takes office, he hopes to turn the Chamber into a house of respect rather than insult or shouting, making it look more and more like the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress; for example, the President of the Government was interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Martín, and his good work, and indicated that he did not want to give the impression that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate propaganda
As the climate debate relentlessly criticizes both climate change skeptics and those who prioritize social and political debate, the movement as a whole must be strongly cohesive.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in need of explanation regarding the action or inaction of his government, which has contributed decisively to Spain being among the countries within the EU that have least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance, to which sectors is this due, and why did his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, not stop this development?
Moreover, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he intends to take against climate change.
Which companies will be affected, which behaviour of citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures will have to be implemented and what economic consequences will result.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice themselves and will pay to save the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such explanations in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can actually be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero from an electoral strategic point of view that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty slogans without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician, who is otherwise so suitable for election campaigns, does not have to speak, accuse, nor demand, but instead pursues the demanding expense of embellishing the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or if we may only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana for alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, which belongs to Murcia. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody on suspicion of urban planning violations, it was said today from investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and where he is still located, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the manhunts that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land were to be redeveloped for urban development projects led by the Galician construction company Nuaria. It was supposed to build 4,000 apartments on the property after the local administration sent it illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but were subjected to a preliminary investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales is also under investigation.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who resides in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The president and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G., whose company is a subgroup of Nuaria and allegedly received the bribe.
The investigation is carried out by the Municipal Authority for Urban Development Offences, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven other searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly linked to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the town of Murcia; this was to include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which needed to be converted. The aim was to realize a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking lots of Coruña streets, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector, and Preconiza, specialized in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will move away from the term book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of another name with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
Folks, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the forefront of the PISA study), which comments on the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; coincidentally, on the day whose edition contained the review of Blackburn's book.
The content of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the Jokela school.
Responsible for the gruesome murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, Pekka Elo, chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, called on teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested removing Plato's teachings from the lower school curricula for philosophy at grammar schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you rob a music store with a value of less than 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the shop up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offense, but the penalty is lower than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than in a music data exchange.
Engaging in a rebellious conflict carries a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while exchanging data results in a prison sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trafficking in copyright-protected films whose authorisation by the authors has not taken place is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has raised his demands quite a bit.

My family doctor hands me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money Leads to Activation of Certain Brain Areas, Especially When Others Get More of It.
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was carried out using a tomographic magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&Brain, the activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and therefore received the same salary; but when one of them received double, there was also greater brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to arrive at such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. It is based in the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave office with one crying and one laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims lost their lives - namely ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on the list that the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach used as the basis for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in her plan to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their nets.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers a possible claim caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding severance payment in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance, which is made up of several factors, including age, gender, time of issue of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that in the event of a higher risk of accidents, higher premiums are due.
For this reason, both over-25s and women have to pay fewer contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When drawing up the premium, the insurance companies must take into account a whole series of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
At this point, we list the most important points that should be considered when choosing an insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance-oriented, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance, such as the lack of driving experience and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best to take out fully comprehensive insurance for ideal insurance coverage, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a fully comprehensive insurance with excess, so that the benefits of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures customers against external accidental damage, but not against damage caused to their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate with the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty implies an increase in the said tariff.
The amount of credits and penalties depend on the company and its earnings.
If the company has had a profitable year, it can afford to increase bonus payments, explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving experience.
Thus, it makes the most sense to opt for a fully comprehensive insurance with deductible.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the fear of the beginner has been discarded.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who does not have children, it is more advisable to take out fully comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person in question allows it.
On the part of insurers, married couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and their premium payments are correspondingly low.
In this case, a fully comprehensive insurance with excess (with an amount around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which only starts for the third year of the vehicle.
Overall, they drive more relaxed and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to set a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out a fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible (at an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be said that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damage, but also because it involves high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the point for the round of sixteen
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight at San Siro next Tuesday for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals before the conclusion of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scots decide their participation.
The Italian side already have five points and confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points need another to be sure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will fight for the first time on the 13th semi-finals for entry into the final, which takes place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be finished before everyone else and the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will lead to the much-anticipated result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home because the Celtik Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would be first in the group and thus have a better starting position in the knockout round.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be enough for a defeat of FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because if there is a nine-point tie, the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the second game (2-0).
Accordingly, the Milanese will try to spoil the evening for the Scots. They, in turn, hope to reach the knockout stages of the revamped Champions League for the second time in a row, having been defeated in exactly the same round in the previous season by a goal by Kaka in injury time (1-0) and by a zero-to-zero draw on the first leg.
While Shakhtar FC awaits the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the knockout stages and their membership of UEFA depend on their victory and a defeat for Celtic Glasgow.
Benfica Lisbon, despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the biggest European championship, could win third place and thus play in UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour after the band's dissolution in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which had caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their greatest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold armbands on stage, which Posh Spice's husband, English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans in the audience that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him to do so in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star never saw our wardrobe once, so I'm curious to see what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 led to the dissolution of the group two years later due to internal disagreements, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world had changed, that the feelings towards the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, why not; So I'm glad I made that decision," Chisholm said of the band's breakup that prompted them nine years ago.
The singer also announced that the disputes have been resolved and now everyone is very fond of each other again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines aircraft, according to a report by CTV.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will next perform in California, San José (on December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will take the stage in Madrid on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is smouldering between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being affected.
Most of Russia's natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) pass through Ukraine, and every dispute between the two nations is watched very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine will have to be charged more, as the company has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom's imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove up prices drastically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own stockpiles with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish National Health Service needs to improve criminal record checks for workers from outside Europe, a member of the watchdog said. outside
Chief Financial Controller Robert Black's recommendation came after a foreign doctor was linked to the attack on Glasgow airport in Scotland in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish National Health Service had no precise idea of the number of its foreign staff.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October, and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The National Health Service is expected to carry out pre-employment checks on foreign staff to ensure they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the Agency does not have jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The chief auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record extract, which helps employers with inspections in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said Scottish health authorities would follow their pre-employment inquiry guidelines to a high degree, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information is available on the number of foreign health service workers."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the run-up to the recruitment of potential NHS staff would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current NHS Scotland pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will bring," he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, partly because board members have problems identifying those employees who are on indefinite leave.
The inquiry also found that established control procedures were largely followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was important to me to carry out this work in light of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in liaison with the health authorities, would take into account the report's recommendations and ensure that best practice would be reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment check-ups for all staff - including those from abroad - which are due to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the biopic about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Film.
Awards were also given to lead actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing British film to the world.
The awards were presented in a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control followed Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was shot for just £3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of U2's album Joshua Tree, two awards - Best Director and Best Directorial Debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mob boss in David Cronenberg's London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors, and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had detained 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as on clerics and security forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect facilities after a failed Al Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery facility in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing an interior ministry statement, says 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell headed by a "missile expert" who entered the country illegally.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clergy and security forces, according to the report.
The government has warned clerics to do more to stop Saudis seeking Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias seeking to fight allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, seen as heretical by hardliners among Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias see many clerics in Saudi Arabia as collaborating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – are targeting foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the last few years... five months," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told state television.
The arrests also affected a "media cell" of 16 from Medina that aimed to promote "takfiri thinking" — the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal a glimpse of Earth's future
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit show that the planet resembles a distant twin of Earth even more than was previously realized.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists now believe.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower pace of rotation, Venus took a very different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how Earth could evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth's, while otherwise the planets are quite similar."
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" seized by police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people have been arrested and that the material is being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he didn't think it was worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters record and submit questions on video to broadcast to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman questioning Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party as it heads into next year's elections.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate, who chose the budding candidate YouTube clips to show.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, immigration took centre stage.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to operate a dial when they heard things they liked: The television network noticed spikes in approval as candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who has moved forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two clashed particularly fiercely when questioners asked whether any of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Lesser candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to follow up on the issue.
Neither of the two men has a serious chance of winning the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they hit the immigration slap earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: stricter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate clearly became problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to argue that although the Bible was his favorite book, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now, against all odds, in first place in a recent poll in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to see if Jesus would approve of them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his storms of applause in Wednesday's debate.
These two have sprung up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party from the outset and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness and a wink at both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politician paid Parisian hotel bills, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman concealed donations to Britain's ruling Labour Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under other people's names, and that the party failed to report it, is something that the embattled Gordon Brown would have gotten along without.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded the call for an election, stupidly insulting the British intelligentsia by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly astute deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, put it, the once-feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy bailout of Northern Rock, a struggling bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under attack.
Ill-conceived proposals to amend tax laws have turned business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data of 25 million people by the tax authorities revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the House of Lords in protest against cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and its former head of fulfilment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably leaving.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a tipping point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
People neither like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he does not even need to be around for long, this delay is over: the civil service begins to leak; cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misadventures – such as the long "money for nobility" investigation into political party funding – voters may assume it was him.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks.
The transgressions are not as terrible as conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be so, but it was not up to him to decide.
The anonymity laws for big political contributors are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement but not that it was illegal, will of course have to face some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He was quick to condemn his party's violation of the law, but he watered down that determination by reaching for a familiar instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject -- led, to put it bluntly, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be learned" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee on standards in public life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
This would require Labour hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unassailable righteousness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis infecting America's credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural for dorsal fins to swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is ailing, the predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion spreads from underfunded loans to other forms of consumer lending.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both write-offs and delinquency rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are each unrecoverable or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer funding, partly because of weakness in credit card holders.
Still, it's too early to panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large portion of credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus late fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, showing how much of their debt consumers pay off each month.
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the gridlock in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, expects output volumes for 2007 to ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the housing credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt, now that home equity loans dry up.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower's creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for the card issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage payments decrease if the real estate is worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We're not going to wake up one day and completely revalue loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's principal finance officer.
Even if a sudden shortfall in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are far more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimer future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraudulent scheme with Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their petitions to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of telecommunications fraud for allegedly colluding with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The trial had been scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original charges against her in 2002 drew Fastow's attention to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The indictment against the bankers — dubbed the "NatWest Three" — claims they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped drag the company into the vortex of bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated the value of its stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had substantial value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely argued to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others cashed in about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the Louisiana Federal Penitentiary.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on $1 million bail that required them to live in the United States awaiting trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer disguise billions in debt or make struggling ventures appear profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died last year from heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you are asking for that many seats because it's for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires Exhibition, a four-day of flaunted consumption held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had set up exhibition booths, hoping to interest newly-paid Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-plated car crickets that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully set his sights on a shiny orange Porsche at the next booth.
"This is a nice car, but it's small change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did in its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi high-flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, Russians stand out as the world's most visible generous donors.
The most exclusive luxury brands are seeking their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a luxury industry conference this week attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a combined $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow — that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London-based jeweller.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all groomed in an exemplary manner and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they parade through the halls on Sunday night in evening wear, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the nouveau riche, the type of brand-conscious Russian shoppers who would be willing to spend several hours stuck in traffic to visit a draughty warehouse that shamelessly juxtaposed Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt picture made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimper."
In fact, the traders here say that Russians with old money (10-15 years is old by Russian standards) have already moved from ostentatious logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, thronged through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars to customer requests, said he had sold three car grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom that resemble linked chain bangles for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-set.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium will not necessarily ride on those wheels," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" does not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who weren't millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone booths based on the British model, which were crammed with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the piles of money around, have mobile phone photos snapped by friends while they sat back amidst the spare wealth, or simply to pocket a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Botched operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car there.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the coroner's van approaching," Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now, investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon that police did not identify and who worked at the house at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that sent grief through the top management of Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my pit bull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she is survived by two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Procurator Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are trying to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unapproved surgical treatment.
"That's one of the possibilities," Ms. Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh declined to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "ethyl vanillin" — used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes — sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates lead to the rise of world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by cutting interest rates further were bolstered by soothing comments from the vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the No. 2 for Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said policymakers needed to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to ongoing pressures in financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm disgruntled markets amid signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October."
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of a further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid more bad news from the U.S. economy now that U.S. real estate sales hit a new record low in October.
The aftermath of the financial turmoil was underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 Index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK benchmarks.
Germany's DAX index rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the resurgence of credit pressures on markets was underscored after strong demand was lent at a remarkable 4.7 percent at an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to European commercial banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the US central bank and the European Central Bank to inject more capital into money markets in London increased as credit tensions saw three-month "Libor" rates for borrowing between UK banks rise to their highest level since late September at 6.59 percent, after a steady increase since November 21.
England faced with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who should beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, on call at least under this particular title, is here to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filling up with applications for national electorates, if not part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport undoubtedly is.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his profession while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in cricket, where the choice is difficult, where judgments are necessary, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps be asked in another area, such as whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket must be given regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who will apparently play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets of 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and are hoping for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough into a major Test cricketer and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia,  may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion during today's net meeting at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Speaking for Shah is his sparkling and valuable 88 Test debut innings at Bombay, 43 top-notch hundreds and only six from Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and an excellent record against twisted balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the Test at Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors when Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his batting.  which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a shovel-by-shovel of joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his stance away from it was summed up when he recently rolled over a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was get out his Vodafone (sponsored of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from afar, and say with enthusiasm: "Did you see that?".
Bopara is a much better outfield player, he bowls his middle pace with some effect here on the pitches, which seems to suit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I'm inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not look good if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired and others hoping the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning in private transports.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed a lot of doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from most of the Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia had helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they were starting an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. troop surge and the growth of local "groups of affected citizens" who are arming and collaborating with the American military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed widespread suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country's sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been displaced from Shiite neighborhoods and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and conflict will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarlanders have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday I explained to a non-Saarlander for the 50th time that we are not French" - this slogan is self-ironically posted by the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland's education system, which ranks fifth in the Education Monitor of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
For example, the universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent.
But Saarland also brings the children of the state to universities in above-average numbers - many of them without a high school degree.
"Saarland uses the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their university entrance qualification at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The possible combinations of vocational and academic training are also comparatively well developed.
In terms of population, dual courses of study are the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
So that the children start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge - a model that is now also copied by other federal states.
Only future comparative studies will show whether pupils' performance will improve sustainably.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of at-risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians calculate better.
And to the chagrin of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez had the timepieces turned back by half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a joke figure.
As the official gazette of Venezuela announced, according to a new law, the clocks will be set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez justified his decision, among other things, with the fact that the United States had imposed on the world the division into time zones on the hour.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair the breaking off of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do that just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was triggered by Uribe's decision to revoke Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spat in the face" of Venezuela with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also on everyone's lips in Spain.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the left-wing populist's constant heckling at the recent Ibero-American summit and ran over his mouth.
Germans threatened with wage losses in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are threatened with a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could expect less in their salary accounts in real terms in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price increases for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Business Cycle Research told the "Bild" newspaper.
Employees could also face new burdens in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion for food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is Earth's hellish twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, as they also occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided proof - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning gave rise to life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If ever there was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, temperatures of 500 degrees sometimes prevail.
"Venus may be Earth's devil twin, but it's a Gemini," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early nineties no probe has been on the way specifically to explore this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed," says ESA.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a vortex of clouds at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves around itself much more slowly: A Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, which remained in oceans on Earth, but was lost into space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"For me, human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain a delicate balance in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but defended Merkel from the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
"The Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows this," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "window dressing policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in german-Chinese relations.
For example, the Chinese leadership has not only disinvited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to information from SPIEGEL.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
China rejects European politicians receiving the religious leader of the Tibetans in an official capacity, Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which also includes other present-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not erupt into violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot shotguns at the police: After the serious youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We have to make sure that social explosives do not build up here and erupt into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Hanover-based Neue Presse.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal, state and local governments are already working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This applies not only to the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, this is already showing initial successes."
However, it is too early to give the all-clear.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban planning and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered in the past few nights heavy street battles with the police.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the Federal Government.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is "above average".
Above all, more training places must be ensured.
Kolat emphasized: "We have to give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany, more than in France, "social control takes place in the families."
In addition, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people must be "quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in action, a helicopter flew over the area with searchlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the day before, a contingent of around 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will crack down as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were ignited by a traffic accident in which two teenagers were killed on Sunday.
According to initial findings of the public prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The Chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is finished in terms of content - and that nothing more can be expected from herself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was muddled and lacking in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by her.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation that she was concentrating too much on foreign policy with a grossly arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she has documented for all to see how much her accusation is true.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an aloof politician who flees into foreign policy and remains vague even there.
Take climate protection, for example: She praises herself unrestrained for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
Anyway, the self-praise - so much immodesty would have denied the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is reaching the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of whitewashing the world.
But in Angela Wolke's realm, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low-income earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses left for it.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child supplement.
Merkel needs three attempts to come up with a halfway straight sentence.
It stumbles as if on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a hard exchange of blows – and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged at the first topic.
He has made New York a "haven for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own house was a haven for illegals," Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of privately employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via Youtube are little more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we let Hitler come to power," accuses John McCain of his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a hard read from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called "waterboarding," an interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the important topics of the campaign now lie beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are opposed, applause erupts in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong then," Romney declares contritely, apologizing to rank and file and television audiences for being a pro-abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets bogged down when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian clothes for the first time
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been sworn in as president.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his post as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling as civilian head of state for the first time.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with lawyers favored by him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies makes music again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a recording from their heyday "Live 1974" is released.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The scheduled sensation then occurs in the form of three seated gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the middle in a flower-white shirt at the age of 63.
Flanked on the left by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, seen from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves much.
The fact that the band Harmonia is making music again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Whereby one may reveal here: Targeted inquiries revealed that the name buzzed through the collective pop memory, but by no means so lasting that this band has been sorely missed for 32 years.
But why shouldn't Germans be allowed to celebrate their living legends from the seventies?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been more true in England and America than in one's own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003, questioning German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also joined the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked them, amazement knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in a foreign country is one thing.
The memory is overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a far lower impact than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out with Kraftwerk and then earned a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weser Uplands.
There, in the Alter Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as fugitive communards.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather in a pointed artist's existence.
Allegedly, a pennant of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for art was also found in the bulky waste.
Harmonia recorded some of it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because as relaxed and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
Collecting brushwood was not only for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record crowd of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band broke up in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since become more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Grönland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as its very own German contribution to lively music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius' solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in Berlin's Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Love Parade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of Krautrock on subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the void of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats in the hall with the most bizarre sounds: "The only true music, the future belongs to it."
There are pictures that show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlour.
Projections of further black-and-white photos of tangled devices serve to create legends.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to the organ and drums in order to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effect devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical tinkerers.
Even the choir of the house does not change this.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, people cough and whisper under clouds of sound and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful place.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music academies (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" here is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia will not be disturbed by this even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This can rob you of your nerves or bring fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace", two more films deal with the Balkan war.
But neither is convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and banging or they are too touchy.
Even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help with that.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, the actor Richard Gere has now been found there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice-trivial roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove out the desire to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes the hunted" (Why do film titles today always have to be as long and confused as train driver collective agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek portrayal: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man who has long behind his very best times, but who has preserved considerable remnants of his former charm even as a ruin-like monument to his decline.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party," along with the German production "Murderous Peace," which also opens this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
With "Murderous Peace" you can make short work: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one promptly falls in love with her.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not portrayed here as the sole root of all evil, the TV-flat film loses itself all too quickly in banging and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal "the fox" could perhaps have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with a different director and a different screenwriter (both Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can't do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not just let be the run-down cynic with heart that he is introduced to us as at the beginning.
No, the script also has to accuse him of a romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when the reporters succeed within the last five minutes in time-lapse what NATO, CIA and all bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that they want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the logic of cinema.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree for once) not to pursue the persecution too intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "Compassionately I see the swollen frontal needles, suggesting: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have just such swellheads, but they hint at how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: When a star hangs around on the trouble spots or minefields of the world, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", which are now considered classics, were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder comes in real time on two screens at home, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carelessness it takes to tell good stories.
After all, "To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good films.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distanced artist's gaze of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's dictionary" and the Balkan war, he replied: "That's only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic cancellation
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday a waiver as "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed such great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the momentum in sports policy would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "based on a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday stuck to earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic, at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Confederation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected at the beginning of December on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
"For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have envisaged so far until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream is not over forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beusts' statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to spoil a chance by burying the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There, von Beust described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade "not as a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD parliamentary group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put the Olympics on the map and excluded housing construction," said SPD deputies Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded integrated planning for the Olympics and a later residential use for the Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU had relied one-sidedly on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had triggered great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Anyone who associates the terms Swedes and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue raisonné.
A large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" stirred up doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes from 1968 a few months ago, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm have now come to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet as a gift in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the hundred or so other Brillo boxes of the "Stockholm type",  circulating on the international art market.
The prehistory is convoluted, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red, blue and white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes: these did not come from Warhol (for cost reasons), but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but their role models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time rightly went down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have fetched more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at Moderna Museet, examined not only the museum's six Brillo boxes, but also three from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their pressboard was first primed and sanded off, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a painter's roll without primer - moreover, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to a different conclusion, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious allegations" made in the matter of soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have remained relentlessly silent.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and called for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have given up.
He could not answer for bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly defect with around 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to guard him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops cordoned off the district around the posh hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other army units would join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Her government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours due to the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There had previously been speculation about a takeover.
One keeps the option open to increase the stake in Versatel.
The move is intended to drive forward the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
Previously, speculation about an entry had already arisen on Wednesday, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house hold the shares only for a third party, it was said on the financial market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile communications company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million of these shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have started discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies have created the joint venture MSP to acquire the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a stake of a good ten percent in Freenet and do not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
The poker game over Freenet, which has been going on for months and is difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-line customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch previously held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch brings in another four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
