A Republican Strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by confirming that electoral fraud in the US is rarer than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
Incidentally, in 10 years in the USA, the lawyers of the Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting the elections in each state.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have been promulgiving new laws since 2009, which make the procedure for registration or the ballot.
This phenomenon has become more important after the elections of November 2010, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries were recorded.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to provide a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods for early voting, the right to be declared invalid, the right to register as voters on election day, and citizens are denied the right to vote for which a court file exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities have rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored draft laws in 34 states, forcing voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million persons entitled to vote not to photograph date issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new peders in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered to be voters who vote increasingly for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the maps issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state demanded proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding that voters prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters who prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators promoted laws in eight states in 2011 that abolish the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to help those voters who wish to register.
These limitations are not without consequences.
For example, voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections contributed to approx. 10 million registering citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new pedals in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of state voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, who were 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
The democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal to influence the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required on the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes in the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for the conduct of early detection tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We have gained the opinion of two specialists.
The studies carried out in the USA had numerous disruptive factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there was a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been carried out.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or. 40 years if you have a direct relative who was already suffering from prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of Afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made really understandable the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options for which prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to be decided to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have been detected in cancer do not take treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to active monitoring and offer treatment if the disease progresses.
One determines with increasing accuracy the criteria for a decision on who should be dealt with and who should not.
That is why I still recommend that you carry out the test.
However, the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Preventive of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the advances in research, the assumption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick on it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eat well and moved adequately.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million in Quebec. Smoker", regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after renouncing the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, smiracle infections, rectum, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against grinding cancer throughout life," he adds.
Food
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of grinding or grinding To develop rectum cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the association between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study has found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predisposition.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has attracted a certain stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is indeed believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been empirically observed.
But it is not yet completely certain for the physicists that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still lacking data to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, let us assume that it is actually the Higgs, since there is apparently only a small risk of deceiving oneself, and let us look at what it is at stake.
There is an inevitably unavoidable law in this world, which causes two objects to not be present at the same time at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too much, as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", largely this "state" consists of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called fathers and who obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, who are not sacred to anything - definitely not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely surprising): the mesons, which we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be stressed here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this location, such as a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "barriers of force".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disordered" for this boson to show itself.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be ragged by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, there are not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep the fridge by itself.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field equally: those who do have one mass, while the others (as they like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all these research be "good" for, asks Ms Plamondon?
For science, they serve to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM closely.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who most earnestly hope that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has great defects, since it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which approx. 80% of the matter of the universe forms (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Impact
The effects of this research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous profile laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was regarded at the beginning rather as a "laboratory playing."
Imagine yourself...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its Committee on Dying in Dying in Dyhren, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had two years left him with a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed for seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eat.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped with food.
He even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea because it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil.
"During our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," he notes to take a step backwards.
According to several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer showered by the doctors and nurses who care about them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear of dying is "conscious and suffocation".
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any desires in life," she says, before she accepts that you put on a mask that helps her breath.
In the next few days, she still awaits a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteer body care and assistance in food intake are offered.
Palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is 11,700 inhabitants a bed for palliative care.
That is very little considered that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, the disher is given a mouth care with brandy or pepsi.
The diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years old, who enjoys the last family meeting in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillow while one hits in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies in a tragical way after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel is disturbed with.
53% of the patients admitted to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their homestay, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Domestic Palliative Care Society in the Greater Montreal area, are more or less specializing exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec's health care that several doctors specialised in palliative care are facing concerns with the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been circulating, held by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. According to Christiane Martel, Quebec's healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure that all have the right to have high-quality palliative care before accepting to pass to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without any measures taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
The chances of survival of HélÃane Richard were already minimal when she stopped arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would stop the treatment, she replied that she regrets that I was giving up the fight, she told.
However, she told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not allowing this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
It must be said, however, clearly that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the Society of Domestic Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, the doctors often resort to the terminal sedation, which amounts to sleep in patients either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the road construction office, construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has disintegrated since drastic measures were taken," sweeps Jacques Duchesneau, a member of parliament in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation into the embassies in connection with the contracts for road construction work in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he stresses, "the Ministry of Transport alone has suffered one billion dollars in the contracts," because some of them rebounded their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Launched in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troops of accountants, receiving and government analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau True", which since 2009 has caused the Montreal "Canalization Cartel" to become more restrained in the artificial injection of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out house searches in rows and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public procurement.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Authority, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly charged.
The latter has caused a sensation by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the 'system' for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game everywhere in the 2000s by holding more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68,000 euros) gave to provincial parties, especially the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal funding for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channel contracts, the cost of which was artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials from the road construction office have admitted that they were smeared by artificially inflating the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organiser of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately overlooked a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies of Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Riviere-des-Prairies district, to the east of the island, she refused to refuse to sell a municipal plot in 2010 that it was purchased for 5 million dollars and reselled to 1.6 million developers in the booming real estate market.
70% Black Money in the election campaigns
From the investigation that is ultimately being carried out, she says that she is "drawn at a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the ant-immigrant system to stop the evil and denounce the guilty things."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are cleaning up the wound, but need a investigative unit intended for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to make clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all think about the role of the "mandate bearers who are in the image about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak copy of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As campaign spending not be severely limited, black money will be circulating in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by taking courage to think about things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international standing of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have reached a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I am making progress ahead every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And this is even easier with a game.
In football everything goes very quickly.
But I am not enthusiastic.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint-Etienne, I have always made step-by-step progress.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions of this summer are used to playing very high levels of games.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to stand up and want to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti earns respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with distinguished clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of the leader.
But we lurk in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say in violence against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group ahead of Porto, so that we can play the second leg of the round of 16 as a home game.
Can the PSG become a big European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a large European club, Paris must win the titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is making the resources to ensure that this project takes on concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is really important to us to cream about this title.
In the last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have closed with 79 points.
Normally you should be a champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are wrestling for the title, I believe we have what it takes to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us is expected.
We accept it completely.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can blame us for, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth finale for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the money invested, you were believed to be a game break with 15 points advantage!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That's why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has achieved is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to take part in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from cutting out some playing time.
I have seen things there that I emerged from.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned our lessons from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we have to show exemplary behaviour.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualifying Group for the World Championships.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Set it on the 16th October in Spain forced draw (1:1) a kick-off game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
I have never experienced a comparable game in my career before this meeting in Spain.
With Bitcoin, payment and sales without a bank is possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin's peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell to 2 dollars five months later, before recovering to around ten dollars today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currency or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" used to move forward in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) by playing games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trading is controlled and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all net nodes are simultaneously depositors of the account book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the file's content, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are available in the public account invoice book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice as many times (less than 10 minutes) for cheating, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionth of a time, leaving a certain amount of leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying for real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering with the help of this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these defects.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-close sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at retailers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, gives Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB envisages in its report of reassessing the various risks that are considered high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and that the Afghan population decides its future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by regarding them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and the worshipped.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with the help of French loans, was duly done.
The truck and tank convoys flew over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more influx by the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was covered by war due to the fighting of the various rebellious groups.
Their coming to power was regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism to the farmers overwhelmed by Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into traders by confiscating land from the government in order to sell them as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American awarding of subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thiefs.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have been able to take advantage of the American benefits: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under their command be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already seeking to restore the militias in the province, who will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization using the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzas does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country that was ruined by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or without a means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, allowing the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to the giant Buddhist site to make their excavations and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely depend on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was held on 20. November completed.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' schools, French Institute at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the reorganisation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and have been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These work, which required numerous local workers, have been able to help suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often covering more than 2000 meters.
Dozens of written requests from municipalities in the province of Kapisa have been received at the embassy.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their wish for their own statements, the continuation of lower, more controlled and that they directly concerned civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A Constitution with the Crow Bar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever regarding the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants its unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on one card.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just one week ago, the head of state had granted this plenum two additional months to complete his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary, several times as amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has caused only an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trail the right feet".
His supporters assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum was to be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to renounce their plan to declare the text section for section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to rediscover its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After affirmation in an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will be sympathetic to vote.
Especially since the Egyptian people are ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited authority", the latter supposedly shall put an end to the constitution once the constitution is now said.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they were unable to bring their views to bear.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 persons, alternate members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, since some members of the body were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not exactly possible.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, eventually remains identical with that of the Constitution of 1971, saying that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberals who see this only as a propaganda strike "fitting" respond to "fitting".
According to them, they are shaping the Islamisation of the Constitution through other articles.
They have in particular look at Article 220, which granted the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the persons who are being asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
One can see the first signs of a theocracy here."
The fears of the Liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment, no concrete religious commitment can be seen.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system," means Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits that "there may be an ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note. ed.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as called for by the associations to defend human rights.
The latter also include their fears about the text, which they consider to be a non-friendly manner.
The facts of blasphemy are being maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article is more than women's protection, highlighting Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The leaders of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists can expect sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Evil before the holy places
Visit the river Jordan where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all those who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the breastfeeding of the sea storm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here celebrate the or. The Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The trail begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretory, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchnae on Mount Golgotha, where the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
According to the Christian view, according to the Christian view, the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple, that of the Romans in the year 70 n. was destroyed.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which then come true.
Take a trip in the ground
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of secret hiding from enemies, the Herod of the Great in the year 25 n. had been built for his family.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at an altitude of 450 metres above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
All the others brings an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 metres, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, where countless tourists are attracted during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods were said to live on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on one trip.
However, at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (parliament).
There, old journals or scrolls from the Dead Sea, which were found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, are kept there, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso will be exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Al Basha bath, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bathing servers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the monument to the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died will resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three towns there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathroom all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, with a location of 417 meters below sea level, is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salinity and thus even non-swimmers easily carries on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and medicinal mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and calming of stressed nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
These secrets are found in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city ran the famous sea route, which connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna, according to legend, is supposed to be lovely touching the walls in the alley with her zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newwhile couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo sessions.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Today, evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Tourist list
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor knowledge of English: About 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is not taken into any euros, but in dollars that can easily be switched to shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually make progress by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a express tram and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stops that connects the lower town with the upper town.
Strictly speaking, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of transport, which ranges in connection for a journey of up to 1.5 hours, including changes.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is suspended.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
Many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without sheds and dishes that contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pate, various sauces, fried balls made from pureed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli towns.
But there are many well-fed cats that roam comfortably and unmolested through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like busy places and do not say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on your brand.
The insurance costs an additional 15 dollars per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and those seeking relaxation came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement is lifted on 9 October. February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the Act on Binding Language Tests for Migrants, Criminals are already acting with falsified certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to maintain the families remaining in their homeland.
On the 1st In December, a law came into force, according to which every migrant worker has to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation has only applied to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
It is not necessary to take language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven both for the preservation and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The entirety of examination offices will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, raised the following question several times before the law comes into force in the press: What does the whole thing actually
What changes does the requirement to have to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, spokespersons for the migration department, it is a matter of reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical evaluation encounter the problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably meet people with evil intentions, who put him in a dark, tight barrack under the pretext of help, where he will wait with dozens of equal months without food and documents and toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We are reaching many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you will be promised the One, and on arrival you will be cheated, get their passports taken off and do not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the head of the Labor Migration Administration of Tajik migration, Tolib Schwariov.
Do not scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they not only cannot master the language of the destination country, but also hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buying decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasise the following important aspect regarding the law.
The test only needs to kill migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to be illegally held in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Excourse for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to maintain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that most of the our documents are falsified and we are not registered, and then cases of extortion arise from this.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says Tajik Umed Hushkadamow to journalists.
"Do not spare costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants could be falsified.
Some fake certificates, which certify the language test, have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: every migrant who hoped to spare such tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights professionals agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased.
For now, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they will receive time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered where no active communication with people is required.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal weapons market
Share of legal weapons of crime extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the Weapons Act for private gun owners.
In doing so, the authorities are responding to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead at the rampage of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban public wearing non-lethal weapons and increase the age of owning firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarowaya, and promised that the amendments to the Weapons Act will shortly be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "aditing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - are demanding that the authorities refrain from "meaningless tightening up".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed the criminal lawyer , Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed to using the registered weapons over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an intensification of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find every weapon for little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapon orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. Weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are stolen by law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that have been stolen from both the police's armoury and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
Many military camps frequently occurred explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases involved arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore squander the weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former serviceman.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what proportion of each of the five channels has approximate in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was drafted by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
According to the investigators, the majority of the illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there through the "guilt of those responsible who have come to do with weapons in their work," the report says.
According to the researchers' data, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are due to thefts in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser for a gun shop who does not want to be named assures that no one has been buying weapons that are found during illegal excavations for a long time, as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more often that traders are taking the supplies in a weapons store.
A weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT, is purchased via a ensign.
The weapon is displayed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, know everything about everything and therefore, if they cannot meet the plan to detect crimes, periodically leads through inspection purchases from traders who offer illegal weapons," the sales advisor adds.
"As in a luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers find the most frequently about acquaintances.
I looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested that I come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I only learned the price for the weapon there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and meet with a code like "Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lost a tooth."
I am even coming to some beating rings about an acquaintance I trust.
He also provides me with the beating rings only because he knows that I don't want to wake him.
Newcomers look for weapons in various ways.
Former military serviceman Viktor Baranez tried his hand at buyers of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed, according to him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was shown.
"I felt like I was in a luxury shop," the military personnel remember.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, but drive into the forest with the seller, and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vontacts" where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
Neither any papers are needed nor are there personal meetings.
"You only need the right sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy the fight gun or rifle".
There, users place their orders and make requests.
Is it sold to minors?
"Naturally without a license," asks users "Ivan" (literal quote).
"Pure a TT. Moscow" is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless bogus sides, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are getting on the net.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military personnel Viktor Baranez
I have heard about the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"As an answer, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie."
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can also go empty-handed and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless bogus sides, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are getting on the net.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, prices of 100 to 900 US dollars are to be expected to purchase illegal firearms.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" it is possible to buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for up to one and a half months.
The weapon is distributed in military weapons warehouses of surveyers of medium-ranking.
According to official statistics by the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences with illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion uncovered with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are striking in the USA
Every fourth American youth is sitting behind the Mc Donald's cash register at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests against low wages in stores of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict yet whether the protests will continue to rise or whether they will soon run out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organisers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organised in a trade union.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the US, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to lots of hand.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and striked branches of the chain along with unions and left-wing activists, whose target groups are low and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car battery to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the smallly paid Walmart workers buy in only at their own job.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the in-house health insurance had risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earned the hour worth 9.5 dollars, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University of Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars the hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
These are approx. 1.1% more than they now donate for wages.
If Walmart were to fully transfer the wage increases to the customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year to achieve additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are satisfied that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not suffer any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash registers on "Black Friday" carried out almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees were setting down the work and the protest action was merely "another PR rick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their destination was not Walmart stores (which are not desired in this advanced city and therefore are previously non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants.
McDonald's says the company is selling billions of portions, and yet you are not granted days of sick, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars the hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get 8.90 US dollars the hour.
Less than it does not earn anyone in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get by in New York with so few money is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youth after school at McDonald's were behind the counter, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with employees of McDonald's, I am constantly encountering people who complain that they can do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal forum whose authors say it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, who started on Thursday at 6.30am in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars per hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The US law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate management doesn't make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high turnover of staff.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests ahead of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan that day.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sell billions of portions, and yet you are not granted days of sick, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support fast food staff so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest campaign of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people local, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet foreseeable whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be listed moderately so far"
The theme of enlarged reality, which is popular with followers of modern technologies, is usually perceived by the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely got stuck in the phase, in which pixels are working on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead forward for 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the world of computers into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about Voice Control?
It is popular, but is it not overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform all who want to inform about one's actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, however, each in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of controlling objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of sweeping gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How this?
- We would we ask me, for example, to give you this bubble dose?
They say it and at the same time suggest it.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot afford at the time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a matter of mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work on the development of new sensor types, which will make it possible to record reactions of people more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your needs to modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Does it lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this respect, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y-, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of frames per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and frankly, the present 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay in our Redmond laboratory, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machinery.
For my work, I needed just such a device, without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Would the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system, in which we could play with different camera tendencies to determine how this helps us to determine a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of technology, the enlarged reality in everyday life has the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the worst variant would be an "changeing" augmented reality, where we could switch from glasses to smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (privately can only see it), but at the same time its weakness, because an augmented reality by means of glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also local limbo.
There is a problem that critics often point out to this idea: There is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well become the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
It is taking pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving something tangible to the "pictures in the air", for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, as if someone felt over the balls of their hand.
There are also bands for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Do it think that it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
This is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to let a person physically in a closed room believe, but instead find himself in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (others than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be settled moderately, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: with many topics, we are only just beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avant-Garde", which is dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The select list has already hosted high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded tempered man dressed in red, which you once find at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, at scene meetings or on openings.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and In the early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up a smile in his face with his fellow citizens through his presence on the street and ensures them in a good mood.
He recently grabbed a revolving organ and became a St. Petersburg rally player, because he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city, for example?
I chose the colour red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the gray standard, evokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to the people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you need to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Culture Palace Newsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I have to go down this path.
Then the time of the old free, yet not officially recognized painters ended at the time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewina"; from this it arose "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was finished.
I'm driving to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
- And all that united in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be at the heart of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists were to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation works there was a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the House of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wore tight jerseys and they were also among the now popular composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but he learned the basics from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In 2000, the press had a poll, which was about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won the category "Artist of the Year", and I reached the height.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of thought.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and is afraid to be so.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves towards the appearance and not to the inside of the person.
But perhaps you must not give a person a hand, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban rattle organ player. - A city of culture should have such a hero.
Who if not I?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the bohemians loved the one and the common people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note everyone likes.
Now you have to consider who you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But several thousand come to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, which were even hanging in a collector's works by Falk and Larionow in a number.
I started with images that usually come at the end of my career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It is said: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They say: servants of culture.
However, not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars perhaps did not understand much of culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have some who could be experts, but they will be blocked the way, as they need high-ranking experts who assess the former correctly and pave the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can hardly grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
Here these are much less.
Art must be modern again, as it did at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth-inhabitants on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question arises as to how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says Vladimir Surdin Astronomical Researcher.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first dealt with the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Already half a century earlier, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to investigate how microgravity affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a foothold; it must be able to stand on its feet and begin to move," explains Vladimir Sychew, head of the laboratory of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks hit wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborn instincts completely blunt.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then stopped the whole thing because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew says to the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last incubator with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosate satellite "Bion" will only be same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already being sent fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was established.
"That was just about the biosatellites, but once again it was only a single experiment, and the research has to be continued," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, humans could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk was held in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, nobody answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman gave birth to space, Svetlana Savizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts where everything went well after long flights and got them offspring.
"The more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity has to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravitation.
The hydro laboratory in the preparatory center of cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water is zero gravity.
Even if adults find water pleasant, it is a foreign environment; however, infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if little Ichtyanders bear witness to the ocean coming from life on land.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the moist's abdomen for about 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid, and that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, because from birth until the first swim only takes 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not get along without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles retracted enormously rapidly, and thus the ability to squeeze out the child also decreases.
Well, let's deal with the aids leading up by birth.
The birth could also take place, for example, in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling of gravity, the organism cannot form a skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in an enticed suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are carrying out together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to us being able to give birth to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space has been mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the earth's inhabitants set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes home to their descendants born in space.
NK head: Control of the black system fails through the fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls short of their application.
In the conversation for Aktuáln.cz, this is what the Vice President of the Supreme Inspection Office (NejvyÃ3 kontrolnÃ1⁄2 Ã...ad, NKÃo), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think that is the case with us," comments Kala on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative practical example, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Neas to the so-called. "Black-System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with checks - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the supervisory office, whose duty is the control of compliance with the law, hinder its activity," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you were discussing a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries regarding public procurement were compared.
What was it about?
This is a parallel examination, which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question of the European legislature laying down how public contracts are to be handled. This is what national legislation is built on. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in our country may be even somewhat "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually set new and more precise rules. We also have to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project be helpful? What do you think of this project?
Especially such joint control could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and reduce and cut and balance thresholds if this apparently does not have a particularly positive effect.
Economic efficiency means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that we only burden the system with excessive "paper stuff" in this way, and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here to our NK, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of the NKÃ3 is the Federal Audit Office, which is structured similarly to us and also has a college that is only formed somewhat differently. However, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these courts also exist in the individual federal states - in this way the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds administered by the districts and municipalities at our company are subject to the control of the national accounts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without any specific information. Nevertheless, in a certain sense Germany is often referred to as a model, but one cannot say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the auditors are better there?
This is certainly not, but as I said, I don't like such comparisons particularly.
It should also be noted that those countries which are a model for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any of cooperation with our authority?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance has had for your authority to amend the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our tests.
Since our checks are subsequent, a certain delay must be expected here.
We have so far had an impact on the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of inexpunfiber" and with it almost 14,000 public contracts have examined and analysed - here the changes will naturally have an impact, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become more "strict" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, the persons undergoing examinations to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable to the effect that any non-compliance with the Allocation Act is tantamount to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system is merely putting the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out here?
First of all, let us say which path is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS does not provide entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called. "Black-Systems" would bother - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must nevertheless be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come, and the control office, whose duty is the control of compliance with the law, hinder its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we pretend to be nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also the right one for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
There is some smooth ice smoothness on the streets, but they are mostly dry.
There is some snow and smoothness on the roads of the Czech Republic.
However, the roads are predominantly accessible, increased caution is sometimes required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Carlsbad, the streets were well passable this morning, sometimes the snow and ice smoothness.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and there is only a thin snow cover in the lower altitudes.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the combs of the Ore Mountains.
According to the district road guard, there was a limited view due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first road routes in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges where the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third street class, including the mountain roads, are also passable.
However, these roads remain shattered or lost snow remaining slopes.
Increased attention is therefore required, especially in the higher elevations.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové areas
On some streets of East Bohemia, there is a danger of smoking smoke, in higher altitudes and in the mountains, there is sometimes still a layer of snow on the roads, and informs the road and motorway management on its websites.
The road masters warn drivers against smoothness of ice, which can occur particularly at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
In particular, ice smoothing can occur on second and third street routes in the districts of LanÃ3kroun, Ã...stÃ1⁄2 nad OrlicÃ1⁄2, PoliÃ3ka, Svitavy and Vysoké MÃ3to.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies in particular on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
A rampant layer of snow is located in high altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Knnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia, it is now mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rain-free.
The temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the district of Pilsen are now easy to navigate, but locally increased attention is required, and the driving style must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can lead to ice smoothnesses on the roads.
There is also fog to be expected, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
These figures come from the district road masterships.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but increased attention recommended by the road master companies between the 80th and the 131. Kilometer.
The roadways of the first street class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, there may be smooth ice smoothnesses in each other.
The roadways of the second and third street class are damp, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections is also valid here.
Drivers should be particularly careful about the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, riders who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to expect Schneematsch.
After the use of spreading vehicles, Schneelage remains on the pass of Ã...ervenohorské sedlo and on the road towards VidelskÃ1⁄2 kÃ1⁄2.
Nocturnal snowwork forced the road master's walks to use, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of fresh snow fell in the district of Ã...umperk.
In the other areas of the district, the roadways are usually fully accessible.
"There are still snow remnants in the altitudes of Ã...umperk in the altitudes.
On the snow swash, drivers have to expect snow-lush-to-go on the street administration of Ã...ervenohorské sedlo today towards the agency Ã...TK.
Their colleagues in the JesenÃ3k district also had to be published at night, according to their views, the streets are free and wet to the high altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully navigable, but in the district of Ã...ternberk the riders have to drive carefully in sections of wood, since the roads are still damp here.
district Ã...stÃ1⁄2 nad Labem, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the road mastereries report several poorly drivable sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothing, the mountain road from Telnice to KnÃ1⁄2nice in the district of Ã...stÃ1⁄2n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero, even in lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. In contrast, no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian lowlands, and the roads are usually dry.
So far, no traffic disturbances have been reported.
Ice smoothing is reported in particular from the radius of Ã...tÃotÃ .
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ã...stÃ3 n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knnice was required due to branches pushed from snow load to the road.
Simon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people love to come up with.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end for the 21st century. December at 11:10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before, i.e. on 20. From 21:00 onwards, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time.
The end of the concerts is said to be about at the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally probably from me, afterwards we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state of this world once we hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key rings against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap also has the so-called performers together with other performers. Anthem against the end of the world entitled "Dropfall is out".
The anthem on YouTube is already very popular today. Will she also be played at the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung by all performers at the same time at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together in a direct connection from Czech television.
The text of the anthem was written by TomáÃ3 Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we are realizing many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, where we have been working for six years together with the Tap association at the JedliÃ3ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the JedliÃ ka institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we then move into with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What are your criteria for selecting them?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and JiÃ3 SuchÃ3 perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will be performing at the Prague Spring for the first time, and we are also preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. In addition, we must of course carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, "SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I sometimes had already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we recently were, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what accessibility looks like in the individual countries, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we in Russia were witnesses that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped. It is still unusual if someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course there that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, clubs are also being developed there, trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And what respect should we catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things in which we hang afterwards...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in the social events, we are a little ahead with the band The Tap Tap a little bit!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at present. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to form a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlika Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and among others. Playing saxophone, I founded a music team together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, this is how our moderator, Láa Angelovic, says, something get out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that the collaboration with well-known singers helped us; besides, we also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this cannot be seen outwards, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and, among others, alike.
Was it your goal to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings whom we would have to regret.
It is people who live and can develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary means.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a step forward for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how to hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and also demand a certain discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and if they realize that they have twice a week rehearsing, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm quickly comes to many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láa Angelovic.
We are an open group. People come and go. This cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the forecast end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected via live switch and a common interpretation of the "Date of the World Fall" by the band The Tap Tap will be connected.
The aim of the concert is to raise the means for equipping a multifunctional disabled-friendly educational centre, which should be created under the name STUDEO in the Jedli ka Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
The entrance fee costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was hosted as the twentieth member of this space agency at a meeting of ministers from the European Space Agency (ESA). Poland is the second member state from the former Eastern Bloc (according to the Czech Republic, which was held on 12. November 2008 became an ESA member).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, although they did not always encounter an understanding.
I remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Ã...ternfeld from 6. December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Award to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905), however, the audience left cold, and after years, Ã...ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Ã...ternfeld won the Prix REP deer, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "entrance to cosmonaut studies".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel has been recognized, among other things, by one of the craters on the down-to-earth side of the moon named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the draisine.
The information on this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered projectiles.
The research work was carried out by the Institute KomÃ3rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the surviving documents it can be seen that the research had penetrated into the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the trade press showed up by Ing. Rohoinski, a photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket engines.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was ended by the beginning of the war.
After the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne), published in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, which is dedicated to four comprehensive articles of space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At that time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was foreseeable that exploration of space would have a future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the International Federation of Space, which was founded in 1951, and the PTA actually became a full member in the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Space.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in developing the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on 10. October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
An improvementd version, the RM-1A, was built later, and in 1959 flight tests began with the two-stage rocket RM-2 in the BÃ3dÃ3w desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was discontinued.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 was the successor to the RM rocket.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor 1A rocket had a transport room with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the founding of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable work.
This decision caused a lively discussion in public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), price tensions occur.
This term means a state of affairs where the manufacturer is trying to cope with cheap economic competition by importing cheap goods by "boding underestimate" competition in order to seize a greater market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to shop cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable amounts to labor costs.
Since private capital does not have a social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it caused, government spending necessarily rises.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own populations and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people with private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is particularly manifested in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own populations to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by curtailing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever greater differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food fees for the poor for several years now, which are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already going into the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income up to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also revealed in the case of auxiliary staff employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same state in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic fall, their social levels are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century. was the case for the century), or to promote a pittance on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here, by this, the question naturally arises as to where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or capital does not mean, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, employees work to be a fraction of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim until they are overwhelmed that the state must not participate in its own economy with capital, and that planned economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital insists narrowly in its position that the state must not intervene in the economy in a steering way.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct the politics and thus the entire state in one's own selfish sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically all-powerful lobby, which is omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual preferential treatment, legislation in which practically everything is criminal, but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry is tasked with private, private, closely linked to industry laws to draw up draft laws.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are quickly becoming in a situation describing Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been understood in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribe, by unlawful suspicion of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption ramped unrestrained, and the people went to the election with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "The only medicine in this difficult situation was a rule, and that a strong man must be elected" Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, as in antiquity, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already in a position to recognise and enforce the advantage for the entire society.
The result, as they did then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not trying to undergo deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of the emergence of fascism and communism must therefore be caused by the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century. century search.
From today's state of affairs, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be regarded as a certain break, during which the next round is already emerging.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites are in complete ignorance of the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters of which we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and recent histories.
The repeal of the law on charitable works is not a solution here, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is to specific political and social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing comes about by violence, or could ever come into being," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus reads: "...that we don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be any," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed by the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty in these recurring waves of killing and who is victim; after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing regions, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence itself.
I want to give readers a look behind the scenes, looking at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in which small country in the Middle East are mainly useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerged from my own understanding of who and which group of people have a decisive influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less evident is the question of whether it was always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of less individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not come into being within a generation's lifespan.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be described as the head of the octopus (I don't know if there is still someone else about them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was held by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century. bought the connection of their name to highly criminal acts, in the background of which they always stood the strengthening of their power, the increase of their property or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or prepare them for them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries after the invasion of Iraq, there were only four after the fall of Ghaddafi, with Russia in the meantime under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America status as a central bank, began to issue his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; deputy Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global demands of power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war had the aim of eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war is intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and their luxury, and would not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (e ecumenism is nothing more than the aproto) and lead to the absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the head is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see Fed Foundation, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not happen again).
After the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they had succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire), then the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary was dissolved.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers allowed a latent conflict situation through politics by granting Germany with gigantic war reparations; in this way they created the prerequisites of impoverished masses, so that they had to cheer only a sufficiently strong leader to the Germans, who called the guilty and offered simple solutions.
End of the 19th In the century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch aimed to found a Jewish state, if possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler took off from the chain where the international bankers had initially held it, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the soil for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers manage to unleash this war, the Jewish people will be victims in the forefront of the battle line, similar to the Second World War, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (only think about how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whereby at the beginning stood the greed of individuals and their striving for global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as in us, the people, are exclusively putting their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone politician loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything to ignite a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly spread to a global conflict, and in which it could come to a global conflict over the world economy, only about the world oil, because of the world oil, the world oil, the world.
What light appears in the words of David Rockefeller from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the small, and the great, and the rich, and the poor, the free ones and the servants all give themselves a mark to their right hand or to their foreheads, so that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has the intellect, think about the number of the animal.
For it is the number of a man, and its number is six hundred and sixty.
The film Argo: If the worst is, calling Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah's Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the USA after the revolution, which had maintained the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to impose the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free the hostage made everything even worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were arranged by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages at home caused a wave of solidarity and anti-iriasnaean moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the USA a small victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in bringing the refugees from Iran, helping them to reveal an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff that allegedly visited shooting locations for a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood collaboration.
In order for the camouflage to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called one. "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the levels of mood alternate in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no big differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood come along ironicly and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the corridors, on the telephone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has managed a remarkable restart of his career.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the Crime No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (USA (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that does not play in the director's native Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that took off the director's previous films from Hollywood's standard.
However, Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are set in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story comes somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the wrong movie staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, he works quite successfully with whatever number, whereby he sometimes helps reality somewhat - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a little artificial).
The weakness of Argo is his all too broad dispersion, which is conditioned by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters have earned more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some of its traction. It's a film you follow with some interest and the design and the thriller from the 70. years of reminiscent retro style can be emitting.
However, it arouses enthusiasm hard.
However, as a reminder of a still living piece of history in a certain way and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually surveys the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to contest "Evening Ordinance or. Idea from the EU workshop".
"This is the idea of the plan recently made by the EU to introduce a 40% quota of women in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013," said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding admixture of bioethanol into fuels, which is subsequently nature-damaging, the further ban on the reliable mercury thermometer, only because it contains a relatively small amount of this hazardous material, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of which eggs became much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also received the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member states (the Czech Republic is currently trying, for example, to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threats).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission was defending itself by arguing that it was only harmonising the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards of fruit and vegetables have already been weakened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
One candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of the past year, which, according to balloons, must be notified when selling that children under the age of eight must not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU relied on an American study, which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation death.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground squads.
Strange ideas are also available at home
A directive concerning the European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who holds an official role in the EU must not use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez, Laissez, the server nominated BankovnÃ3poplatky.com, in addition to the above-mentioned. Absurdities also include the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks, which was allowed to be located on the day of our accession to the EU in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for canned mushroom, for which we were faced with a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for requests for grants.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply for a refund to the EU", said then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in autumn 2004 (SSD).
As an argument, he commented that the grain harvest was very high and that the state camps were very high as a result of the so-called. Intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic to such an extent that it organised a tender to purchase grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel NÃamec (US-DEU), provided grants to the municipalities for applications for funding, specifically to provide Brussels with a funding for the setting up of grant applications.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve recognition, some experts believe.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been enforced by individual member states during the budget negotiations.
Emotions also evoke in this country the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarÃ3ky", the Inländerrum (TuzemskÃ1⁄2 rum), whose tradition is up to the 19th century. dates back, but our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products from sugar cane stills, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses of Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the Parma ham, the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, Karpfen from Pohoce and TÃ3eboÃ3, or the Saazer hops, also appear in the company.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic gingerbread or the Hoicer rollers can boast.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr. Senator, how do you think that we are running for president?
I am not interested in being a senator or president.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thiefs roam free while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am over 40, and independent and non-party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Do not you turn your back on your constituents?
I said to myself all the time that I would start the struggle for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people scold in the pub and in front of the TV, but put down everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to rob you of the honour and confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I was bribe to journalists or that I was an adviser to JiÃo Paroubek.
Let us talk about your visions.
You have started the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets of more than 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As president, you have no competences in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can hold legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the guidebook remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone from the right or from the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only holds up the population.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that without pigeonholing and party dogmas from any party, I can take what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me rather left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important for me to make progress.
I am not concerned with whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KS-M or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You do not like someone calling you a pop list.
But do you not confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
For my view, this can be called populism, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already functioning in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only have buzzwords.
And that does not get you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, enforce material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me to ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television to legislate on the legal anchoring of material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the people attracted would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality who points to grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was an earning amount of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and are trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things themselves; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I cannot achieve anything alone; that's why I spoke to several well-known personalities about whether they would also be running for the Senate.
For example, I spoke with Radim JanÃ3ura, who, however, refused due to work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure.
Sixty percent of those entitled to vote did not go to the elections at all, and those who have left mostly elected establishment representatives.
In the Senate we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of the mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I have not yet considered this, because I have no time to check the past of every potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; only CZK 20,000 on my transparent account is.
You have no money?
You speak of declarations of assets, what would your look like?
I value my private wealth at around 60 million. CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, one apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skodu Superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a few million more in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a child's dream - I always liked James Bond how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program does not arouse too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign from his own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senator salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would be running for nothing.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to make a live?
Didn't you say that you will cut back these activities?
But that is not related to the level of salary.
As promised, I have partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
Approximately 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be so.
As President, however, I would fully stop making my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built book mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "But, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one person is still voluntarily going to one of these old-style libraries, doesn't it?
Spijkenisse, a city of dormant that is barely in need of view, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to replicate the seven fictitious bridges shown on the euro tickets as nicely brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to master the statistics: a library must be found!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of the daring bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with accustomed serenity and appeared in the face to the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin.
And while the jury was still puzzled around looking around and shrugged with the shoulders, the cheeky Maas stacked his exquisite souvenir of size to a pyramid and ended his actionistically underpinned speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
So this is he, my suggestion for the Bücherberg von Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is piled up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small town cake, which has not yet had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned old town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to accept a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: book eldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, but the real spatial and reading pleasures can be seen when the feet climb the topography is possible.
The all-around glazed interior is bright and clear, the fired brick floor and the elegant street lights speak unmistakably the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for Parkbank, dog and football boys and girls playing.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookcases are along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and pierced the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is skilfully used: offices, internet library, chess club, the environmental centre and the building services centre are located in the middle.
A special joy are the black bookcases, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes parapet, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads because of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, one day we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian agricultural farm.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used in the Netherlands as a root base in greenhouses and in fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, after which it is ready for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed into four centimetres thick plates for the first time in these quantities.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells a bit of new car and one bit after a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike, the literature café not only rewards you with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heating and cooling is provided with geothermal energy.
Although the book mountain is under a glass lintel, the sun shines only briefly inside even on sunny days.
The wide wooden cerebral essentials, which stand crosswise to the glass facade, serve as shading and intercept a large part of the sun's irradiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic roller blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptician from the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "longly overdue soul".
The reason: Every resident was invited to open a few weeks ago to donate a book from his personal holdings.
This is intended to fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully assembled - currently 70,000 units.
The concept has emerged.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every occupant now has some relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for adornment.
This enables MVRDV to be successful in the supreme discipline that is called identity foundation in the technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained from voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US European relations, Berlin is balancing it on a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would be against the application for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is precisely changing its foreign policy, and that is away from a policy that has been managed, so to the shape of the USA, so towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans therefore find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still groping to their role, but they are on their way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy as France or Great Britain have.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to also take positions in the case of national interests that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from that of the other great powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be careful not to throw the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This definitely plays a role.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to this, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
I therefore do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even respect for itself.
It signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly said about a veto.
Are there any differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Due to American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Does it have a hard time agreeing on its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I believe that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans to be a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things out of their own position.
They are doing this with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to play a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still difficult to play the leading role?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, a wide variety of anti-German feelings are released.
This doesn't make it easy for Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the USA in European politics is continuously decreasing, but the EU is not filling up this vacuum at the moment, who else will remain?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they are unpleasant and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the origin companies.
Nevertheless, it does not enjoy protection as long as the actual namesake do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in infringements of property rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are already enough for the imitators to register their stamps.
This makes Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can insert Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattal opens a folder with entries of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On the 14th In September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected the trademark there, a fashion name that also used at the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the large cities there are multi-storey department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
Pattal cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, on the other hand, he takes the right to officially receive Chinese companies from the trademark office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a co-driver brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This refers to women who fish rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is damaging to business, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is being diluted, the unique street is disappearing, the damage to our image is enormous."
The financial failures and the legal costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially with expensive flagship products.
According to the market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deleting dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
The procedure can continue for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattal reports on cases in which the court reported complaints because after the long duration of the name objected to, after the long date, the court ordered has become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even had to pay money to the plagiarizer because he injured his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was set, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had the famous crocodile looked in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too low staff and interior equipment.
Last year, however, the "recounter situation in the workflow has returned to normality".
For example, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still waiting in the office for completion.
Tackling against it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in a row, the authority informs.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Tackling against it costs a multiple, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to achieve that its illegal production of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich, says Hanno Wentzler, who had failed to do so because they were not protected in Germany.
The CTMO trade mark office also rejected the Munich-based objection.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the trial resident continues to fight today.
You have to become hellish care
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that it will bring things to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the dishes.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to look through one hundred-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much we worth it," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to spill back into Europe.
Then, when immigrants secure unprotected brands.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to file the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since given up this business area, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You have to become hellishly care," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stacker advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but should register "all that is somehow worthy of protection in China, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can become much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg is subject to its brand drama in the last act, then one would probably have to pay license fees for one's own name to the opposite side, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
Worldaids Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8,733 kilometres.
First there is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singer slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - beat, beguire and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers came to fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the house man.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Helping self-help
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 247,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
The club Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend secondary school.
You can sponsor 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storytellers or praise on Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room no one, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, what Swaziland suffers from small things like: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly assumed by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying with the mid-thirt is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply in everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
But just one year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has since been taking care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs include HIV, human cardboard flavouring viruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Stuffice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhement are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of all syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydien infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (fung), gonpers and human cardboard fled viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in Germany - nevertheless: this group accounts for around 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human cardboard flavouring viruses are often found in adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urination complaints, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How to protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Some of the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed can be mostly STI cured and long-term effects avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the fees that the choir sings on throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"Overall, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairwoman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also cares about the orphans being well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The Gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms arrive time for school lessons every day.
Those who no longer have no one come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks, who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and, together with the American health organisation PSI, has organised that many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to be silent dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two or three years through the south of Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know from the times of apartheid at the southern top of the black continent.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also wrested a few tears from some grim border guards.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shine.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as can be seen from three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet, which is permanently in the shadow.
This should be at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that have hit on Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice associated with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger spacecraft, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the people of the earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are investigating the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small peepholes in endless expanses.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.

This star-forming region - called the W5 by scientists unromantic - the top-rubber telescope discovered Cassiopeia in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling ember of a dying star has taken up the Spitzer telescope of Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star throws out in the death process.

One of the largest and hots of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided three-cold), since dark strips of dust are three parts of the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake bearers, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carom: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't have technical abbreviations, you may call it by its nicknamed Southern Firewheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, picked up the Hubble Space Telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is known by scientists UGC 1810.
In this star fog is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngsters.
This star-cloud, combined with the Rosette Nebula, also constantly produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, but only gas.
Researchers assume that it was only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydroge was mainly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei started it a year later for stargazing.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide have been deepening.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven metres.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is lashed solid at its elevation angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at elevation angle.
Its feature: high light collecting power.
Despite a comparatively small mirror diameter, this reaches the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers cancel each day according to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should include a full 42 metres - and composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures are to be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be built on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since the 24th April 1990 it already delivers pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily for those that are habitable.
On the 2nd On February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
The picture documents the last start preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space-infrarotteskop has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is intended to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, since the Messenger revolves far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been suggesting that there are ice on the Mercury for decades.
The scientists now have certainty through the Messenger spacecraft, which was launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury.
Drink butter every day - and turn 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The drive through the Talysch Mountains is to be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely forested hills, torrential rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of Talyschen, of whom is not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Azorian and is very long-lived.
The terminus is Lerik.
The small town is resident with too important architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the approach from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too arduous.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometres, because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area is documented, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years a child still begotten
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd of Sirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, and he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was said to have fathered a daughter.
So, at his age, sirali Müslümov was charged for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also a remarkable number of people of old in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live".
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific proof of age, especially since the civil status register was missing.
Ebbged melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are remarkably often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is based on food.
However, the fact that the calan-rich food of the Talyschen should be so healthy, that the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products love and, above all, many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter-barrel that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are long grandparents.
Two small children also jump around.
In the kitchen you can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, bulbous Armadu gles.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly lined, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I did not buy groceries once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the post-World War II era.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, who is being driven for the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003 and his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no need under Azerbaijan's ancients.
230 Manat (such as the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-gracsed son is right: "The old people are respected in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as a base is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
For they are all hopelessly divided in a confused opposition.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, as Mohamed Morsi said almost apologetic, temporarily curtailed the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended his competences "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who carries a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about this, the Egyptians are not quite aware of.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
In fact, the 234 articles, which were whipped by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a night 15-hour Parforce ride, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This at least a newly added article suggests: in all the matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be moved, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great appeal into the entire Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, which would actually lead to the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much in the draft of the constitution is a matter of interpretation
Problematic also: civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained further.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition members.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" "and promote their morality and their values".
This is legally unfocused that state institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids to insult or slander the prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Likewise dubios seems to be the wording that the "insult of people" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the president or a joke enough at the expense of a legal scholar?
A matter of interpretation, such as so much in the draft, which Mursi is available for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamist superiority.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it can come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third placed in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft constitution belonged "on the garbage mountain of history".
Via short messaging service Twitter, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition member Jasser Said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile banks in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated in it and cried out, "The people demand the use of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Pupes the land!" and asserted: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
Mursi's followers obviously did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the land should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered certain.
"The word human rights does not even happen"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have actually been going until February and involving all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairwoman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he laments the conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Morsi had the increase in power to all three powers in the state resigned.
These measures are glaring violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president actually suspends it," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle for the direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protester on Tahrir warns, "You are eating a monster that you cannot control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worrying fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the midst of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
This is how one has to imagine the nasal smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this stubborn smell in the air that simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is sprinkled with salt trout, which - depending on how odd one would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
Around us, people consume small fish cubes and eat large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I add some bites.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk sewn to the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a quite long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era when there were no cooling possibilities yet and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was taken out after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly consumed with the help of alcohol-muted senses.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not so much richer than Norway ago, immigrants are streaming.
Rakfisk is considered something important - an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes that can be bought here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't make it into the world press often, and most people don't seem to bother that.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by its name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident of 22. July".
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in their peace-loving country.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world has been mainly responsible for Norway's wealth today.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with ripe rakfisk and her long blond hair and pungent blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a prudent people, as they say.
Their English is just like most people here without any immaculate point.
We are not very shown, we don't like boasting.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry yields are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the world economic crisis, everyone who had money that they did not possess, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eating rakfisk," she adds with lightweight laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else. The juicy flesh stills me.
But in the evening, the stinky fish is back on the menu.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster dressed in a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by rakfisk plates.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
As Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges and mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a clogged city, but on Monday a steel ring was erected that blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential bandage and take over the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proven itself economically, but the country is under the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," said Pena Nieto said in the Oval Office to US President Barack Obama earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the holiday destination attribute the development of tourism and the development of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and business are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's accusations, the new president, lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The village is tucked away under highway transfers and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was involved to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the corpses of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a stain of fallow land near a large landfill land near a large landfill.
During Governor Pena Nieto's tenure, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he at least did not adequately address the problem of feminicide during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete structure, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed that her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse stiffness had already begun.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall. It is next to a cross that carries one word: righteousness.
But it is precisely this, according to the family, that is what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was a gossiper, a troublemaker, a dressing girl.
They want their judgment to be simply accepted and shut up.
"But that's not possible if there were so many formal errors and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bandage on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his term of office.
"I hope as president he is as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The Procuratorate Contradicts Bradley Manning's Allegations of Being Abused in Prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the Military Prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to reject the prosecution on the grounds of severe detention conditions
The US Army's Private is accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor's office tried to find out on Friday that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest revelation of confidential information in US history - missed several opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland declared Maj. Ashden Fein that documents on weekly visits prison officials during Manning's nine-month terms in Quantico, Virginia had not had any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of an application by the defense to reject the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard detention period - Manning had declared suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst of the US army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning were scraped with Manning with the forms filed by officials after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had served from July 2010 to April 2011 under increased detention conditions.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and that the treatment by the institution as a whole was considered "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints about abuse, even though the officials had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and stated that he was dealing with them. However, they were not recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) "No problems," and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have graded his observation status to "prevent injuries."
The military said that it had assigned him this restrictive status - one stage under the risk of suicide - for his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to be able to achieve a better quality of life in my view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday to arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not knowing what happened to him or in the outside world was burdensome.
"My world shrank at Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to keep moving, because the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated into his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up so that he turns back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally appealed to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep one night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had declared that during this count he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket.
When questioning on Friday, Manning stated that he had said that he had made an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had declared that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked. He would have previously tried to show an official that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but not.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his level of imprisonment if he is sentenced at his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be guilty of lesser offenses, while other counts that are considered too extreme will be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The public prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was recorded in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners held under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include the enemy's favour, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he is subject to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of chances
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them of difficult times, says he
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when perplexity spread within me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsafe, to which to which to go.
I grew up in Central California and was called a "Mexicon" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Ir" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later I chose "Mexicon-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and lined up for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trafficking.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason why Mexicans are equally likely to remain in Mexico today, rather than emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartels, even if he did not give any details in this respect.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country to hold a rifle to leave more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. official even makes the most lenient criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints about how the Americans are begging the sovereignty of their neighbouring country in the Mexican press and among the elites.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge is in reality in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our pedigree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity is sometimes blurred, but what concerns our loyalty is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking this hold.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are not part of either, one, the country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but there is no rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational middle class want to resume their ties with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "an ambassadors" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I fear that you have to go through alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to award the United States to deal with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a resentment of how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexicon" when I thought.
Old fighting, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may prove to be an unexpected pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to emoak such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual blame, countless buildings were rubbled, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza have been smashed near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate, given the current situation.
Even if the one on the 21st October agreed ceasefire continues, the week's fighting have strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, is claiming to have pushed the Israelis back, even though its group had to recover great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are being killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are combined in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders may conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to move powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken sides with Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist coinage could stand in front of the crash of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas ally threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region forever.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
By contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weak and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, allow an opposite conclusion to be drawn.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more quieterly.
From a diplomatic point of view, the United States holds steadfastly hold on to its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has been good in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barriers that ceded into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared in violation of international law, but are being continuously expanded.
Netanyahu is well available. His Likud party has moved in the run-up to the elections on 22. An allied with an even more militant group under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these deceitful Palestinians also prefer and leave their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets like their fellow campaigners in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail. But the Arab Spring could make them a head through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little remain for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi joined forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in Gaza will increasingly take its diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides require an outside kick-off
The correct answer is that represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel is denied territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire grants outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the supplies of arms in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would mean more done for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the imminent application for UN observer status.
Obama must also play his part in making Israel negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to imagine his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is also averse to participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Laws on Uniform Cigarette Packaging Enter into Proper
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are equal for all tobacco marks
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic pictures, which show sick body parts and infants and children who are suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts, is after coming Saturday.
Australia is thus introducing the world's strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco use.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will not start with 99% probability even afterwards.
"You can already see young age among children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago on the Supreme Court of Australia with their contestation of the law.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidden them to act as sports sponsors and forces most retailers to no longer cover cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising from local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who markets tobacco and has only one small area left over to promote its products does not avoid the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in experience reports on brands that were written by "normal people."
One has to ask oneself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even records a video for it - or does it have a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries are increasing trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More rigorous laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You simply take a tip and plug the box away," says Victor El Hage when you buy a cigarette packet, where a photo with a mouth tumour is printed.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill up its shelves.
"It used me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that was it, we are closed," he adds visibly angrily.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to worry about.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are citing boredom as something positive.
When it goes after them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are almost constantly staring at one or the other screen today, we don't benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively topical phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn the house walls of a Latin graffiti about boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. According to an associate professor of psychology at York University of Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to practice a satisfactory activity, but not being able to do this".
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slow."
Boredom can listen almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two states might be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we are bored, even if we have difficulty concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom from the Awareness Aspect", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a noisy TV program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others stopped lower volumes, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television stated that they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find any reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University, Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, one has a monotonous activity - "as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt can distract music and help not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that fencing and doodling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to buy more learn and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more easily bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "probability of boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements such as "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida - especially in terms of the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty toughened bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and in doing homework, whereas 23% said they were bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, that he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "the youth are perceived as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday routine.
Back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do is do.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, you become happy.
However, television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, but they evaporate in the long term.
So an iPad can distract you from becoming a child's bored child. However, it has not learned to entertain or control oneself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to talk, but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel at home away from the constant activity and technology stimulation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in reality people are only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to keep busy when the noise is silent once the noise is silent."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is courted in south-eastern Colorado for an offense that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar on a September day near the Kansas border when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug padlia - cavalier offenses, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana to its own use, the answer depends less on the law in hundreds of smaller drug crimes than on the location.
Hundreds of administrative offences revolve around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small-scale possession. This will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that existing marijuana crimes will continue to pursue and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana business from opening in their communities.
"This situation continues to develop so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
Regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are also scratching up their heads.
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1, ending in the first edition of the drug. December 2013 in front of him.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for Spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, occurs on 6. December in force and thus also forms the end point of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be resolved during this time, such as how state requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis transactions within 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle conurbation," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recent research group.
On the 21st In November, Chief Oates sent an email to his employees in Aurora, saying that the prosecutor would no longer persecute minor marijuana offences among people over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek any criminal complaints for these offenses "now."
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban guidelines for regulating medical marijuana growing and drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck holds a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were offences at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer displays adults to own smaller quantities.
District Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all outstanding ownership proceedings be dropped.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time by asserting the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state caused a profound gap among local officials to light the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who holds accused of courting marijuana crimes and acts as spokespersons for the national organization to reform marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for not being able to accept legalization," he believes.
The first states to treat smaller quantities of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are considered national models for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also waiting nervously for the federal government's instructions, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of federal marijuana as a criminal offense.
Advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed medical marijuana to be sold in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while detectives are unlikely to hit doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they will probably be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Before election day, some local municipalities authorized moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although they could not open until about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We follow what the community has decided for and not according to what the state has decided for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today's university students are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once considered to be the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College in the late eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and caused the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard was said that I had left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
A N Wilson said mischievously that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed only for one reason - a reason that seemed so narrower and more cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I had been a proponent of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students are suffering from similar persecution.
Organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equality protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted" because of their political views."
They demand a place in their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It showed, among others, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who rode in a Rolls-Royce and cast with a silver-coloured suit and a silver-covered walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sinners for introducing higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the Conservative Students' Association of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford, says she had observed a growing rejection of students from the moderate right among JCR members.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18 year old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - no honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even started Stalinists.
In the first days of the freshman week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a foretaste of the future events.
I experienced that the tutors not only tolerate the mocking of Tory students, but even were happy to participate in it.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the South African apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I should include French texts from the 18th century. translate into English. I was not told what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (descended in the meantime), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite spiteful.
"We're able to learn thatter fans, French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students chuckled.
In my eyes, tears were sitting open.
"I suggest that you take a few lessons of French in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I sat alone in college at dinner, as someone quickly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said in a friendly way.
Unfortunately it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory is harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters suggest to be a Labour Party supporter.
I later tried to obscure in a local pub.
I insisted that I am not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher was in agreement.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
An a freshman in philosophy, politics and business, who had ironically attended Eton College, which was considered a conservative basis, told me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?", one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that lay ahead stretched before my mind's eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had advised and wrote speeches for its factors.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and small-minded, and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my dad that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed disbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, smallly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His wet eyes were clouding.
Give it a chance to it all.
I'm sure you're just ting you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had yielded to the pressure and rejected his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, during which another historical gate was seriously claiming that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly descended in shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing" and called them "old idiots".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my captors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Feel free to call me a tearful tail.
But no 18-year-olds should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is still hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Masters of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized this at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective, for which more than 130 skin couture dresses were put together, created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which was still held until the 3rd March will be seen, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the humble fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't quit their tilting on your wonderful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as e.g. B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charism of the fashion designer.
Many years ago we went to him for dinner after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All those invited felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model" that began her career at the 1995 Week of Haute Couture in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsession, rather of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long catwalk that proposes a role change: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with AristÃ3e's Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti was wearing in "La"
In this audience of fashion dolls, names like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and SofÃa of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Designer, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the ex-Herhem duchtress of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a neckline that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between ParÃas, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps up her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory-coloured silk dress with beaded, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metre long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20th century. century, "return to the customers of the supreme society".
For years with the elite's savoir-tre, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italian's highest distinction), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-groomed and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; time does not leave any traces of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfur-containing gas coming out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After he has broken out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that rises to an altitude of 2,386 metres, but the exhausted vehicles need more than 40 minutes for the climb at the turtle speed, keeping their balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tirous heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which has set up a mine party a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has exploited the occurrences in the volcano and (not better) its workers since 1960, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This then sells them to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each other," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
It takes three hours for each route, after which it has been completely accomplished, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an inhumane effort is, however, three times that he would earn from what he would earn with the field work.
"The day wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life on Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first mark on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a squirle.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and stands open every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also exudes at night, where its characteristic yellow colour shines bluish in the dark.
The shadows challenging, he rises into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 straps load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite their large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulfur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the vehicles working on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) a hammer price per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrycot.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue, "as long as it works," because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and pinches the miners in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses ... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which have deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back, Unainik, at 53 years of age, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at an 18 kilometre distance.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder, with his 30 years, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but the sickness of generation holds on to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the fact that they do not have children, careers, stress and costs of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us meet our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candies, but nevertheless - or precisely because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sets are part of a rapper song, the local sayings like e.g. B. "Slide will make a "bao" (loop) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial will reach the attention of the problem in a funny way.
Their creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When we were the worst in the world, so we realized that it was an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as e.g. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (quick flirtations).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought why are we not doing something as creative as possible to address this problem, e.g. to compose a rap?
1,2 children
Those who do not take this issue lightly is the Singapore government.
Every year, it spends 1,300 US dollars on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to 15,000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and distributes tax advantages.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in south-eastern Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why do the Singaporeans not get more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to marry and form a family to have much more options in terms of life goals and set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of standing alone and to delay the marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs, and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square metres and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of single standing alone and that they put them off from building companies building a large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singaporeans working in the financial district can see that they will not have a major impact.
"People are heavily stressed, the apartments and the upbringing are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and costs for property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting children - the government can do so much.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "the area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his daily lives and social networks?
Does he experience the dangers he exposes himself when he makes known situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El PeriÃ3dico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the Internet.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't announce my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10 year old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know her, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't of me, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked, crime, or offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the nut who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just uploading it," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends" he states.
Asked he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits that he does not know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't frighten me because we have something in common, for example, music," he states.
According to the boy, no one has made him hints or asked him about his address or telephone number.
"If someone urges me or requires them to me, I simply remove him from my account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experiences that are now known as cyberbullying are not unknown to the boy.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never known who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the account.
"He only did it privately."
He then explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
In contrast to Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances into uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he is unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and training, thinks that to orient the children and young people must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them, when we still learn ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criterion about what may be spreading, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky if they are most important to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what is privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To say they shouldn't, they don't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like it when you publish a photo of yourself, like the one you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people permission beforehand if you have labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: do everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is indispensable that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Closing of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the state and presidential law firm initially announced that they would be handed over after the exam, but then declared that it would be published on the Peruvian government's website at some time.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented in short statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the announcement "private meeting, limited audio".
The little information circulated among journalists was received by the press officers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document that was disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media to discuss more information.
The presidency of Peru then sent an e-mail to the media with the "Final Statement" of the summit, but it was the Humala statement and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd place. Summit South America - Arab states (ASPA), and also on this occasion, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not published on this occasion, despite the press strongly calling.
On the official website of the ASPA you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they were highly limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which attaches a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián PiÃ3era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which began on Monday in The Hague, in the trial of which Lima against Santiago were listening to the pleas of both sides.
"We will comply with and carry out the judgment on the differences we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that complies with international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," adds PiÃ3era, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ after Colombia had filed a lawsuit against the agreement of Bogotá following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit attended the summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state read out the final document, in which it said that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were determined over an investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
In addition to the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we are extending the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be driven to "improving cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects that are intended to improve spatial connections in South America, and especially in rural and border regions... and thus unite our countries and develop new forms of economy," said the Peruvian president in a read-out declaration.
Among these projects there are also five Peruvian ones, which were located on the cross-axes of his area from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the Summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he began his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday he expected a meeting in Mexico with his counterpart to Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respectfully treat the maritime conflict after a judgment of the ICJ in question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet President Daniel Ortega on the day (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not excluding, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the time of office of the new president of this country, Enrique Pea Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, in which the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region is to be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has presided over the title of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, whereby "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who on 6. Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to state television in Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that promotes the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; but there are still reactionary sectors that are seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reshaping of the Organization of American States (OEA) in order to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we the South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "founded assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and its procedure would not be respected."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had requested that he be subjected to interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offense, while "Swilsaw jurisdiction allows this through a video conference that could have been carried out through the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and psychological harm because he is trapped in a narrow room and cannot perform any physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of everyone," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted by Assange since the month of June at the Ecuador embassy in London was the granting of a carte blanche, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this would be in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the judicial authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar GarzÃan, is leading a series of proceedings to various European authorities," he said.
And "If the UK grants this carte blanche tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype about how Swedish jurisdiction was allowed and done in other cases, the problem has been settled.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he did not tolerate "are the mediocrity, evil intention and lies that refute freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and kinky politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador is no longer "will be dominated by such journalists, nor by the bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and must not grant any opportunism and no coup d'état," because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which advocates Nicaragua's maritime state sovereignty to negotiate the maritime borders between the two countries with Nicaragua, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a southern and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the quest for a common path.
They need to be fully treated so that they can be overcome and look ahead.
Likewise, he relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, and said that "it is right for Latin America to call for international authorities if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility of being a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach his third mandate in a row, he stated that he "sees this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I has never personally interested in power, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had believing that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That is decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state took today in Lima on the 6th of May. Summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The reason for a death because of AIDS is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the examination: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor "tried to weaken" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he was just his 43. Birthday celebrated.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their illness and who have already harmed the virus and have exhausted its immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was based on a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater chances had those who are not addicted to the drug: up to 30 years, at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years.
Simply put, the above sayings mean that those who are diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25 years can "come without problems 75 years old as long as he is under control," this expert explained.
In order to be able to classify this progress correctly, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is true that 60 percent of patients covered in the national database have died since the publication of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are already 187 deaths by May of this year; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why people are still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the medicines. The problem is that individuals come into advanced state because they do not know their infectious condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all persons who need this need must be offered massive detection tests."
This is the proposal by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de PrevenciÃ3n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and also to patients like Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason because a friend had made it from him, who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then you'd rather burst three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do sports and take the medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, take a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to encourage with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live like everyone can live responsibly.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large holes between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the certain places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were handed in individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The people at risk for new infections include the adolescents.
"What do you need that?" is a common question of mockery of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, who do not want to expose young people, assured the correspondent.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be found behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
Promiscy should not be promoted.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered when asked whether condoms would be distributed among his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he put it in the middle.
Key Data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (119,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally located at 4. Make new and cumulative AIDS cases, and to 13. represent in relation to HIV.
92% of the cases of infection occur over sexual intercourse, 6% over the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
One could therefore say that the procedures for survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the leads the on 15. In June, appreciation of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas since the Mexican companies are subjected to the seizure of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit says that the main proceedings concerned the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in the insolvency procedures of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations model law was created for the unification of international commercial law for this purpose, with the American Law Institute being used as a arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies, after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate, which the branches of Vitro had with the branches of their parent company, would not have been achieved the required majority for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was allowed.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed among companies of the group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as e.g. B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have expected 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which caused blows to the country.
For this reason, the González family appeals before the same court of appeal so that the vote is taken in the plenum, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted on.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare opposition is filed, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), in which the proceedings carried out by Vitro are described under the Commercial Conquests Act, and indicating that it had strictly held to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the U.
It also states that the country has subjected itself to the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down in cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Double-banded Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After the advertisements by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner GastÃ3n Azcárraga Andrade, accused of a fraudulent administration, did not make progress for several months, the AsociaciÃ3n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (trade union association of pilots) has finally made progress.
The application, led by Carlos DÃaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of Republic of about a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the F/589 trust account of Bank IXE by the name Mexicana de AviaciÃ3n 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to purchase shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Forum of the Caribbean University of the University, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the countryside beyond the Wall, complemented by a living area for employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing) has managed to unite the governors in the south-east to oppose the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senate to declare under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known as ACTA, has not complied with the matter under the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered it a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has travelled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the country's history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, be it as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, authorized representative and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de BayamÃ3n or president of the basketball association.
"All my life, I have set up many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, the national team's main leader and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes remembered during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in BayamÃ3n, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overdo this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
BayamÃ n in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I was able to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as a managing director, co-owner or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy on BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama, Pirmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player and 2 m tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialists Raymond Gausse, who became natural and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gaussian was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the US for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze if it had not been this Canadian referee, who had us recorded the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favourite, however, is the team of the pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the USA team, as when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico LÃ3pez and "PiculÃ3n" (Ortiz) were present at that team, but also the young players (Javier) "ToÃ3ito" ColÃ3n and James Carter, the brothers LeÃ3n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with whom we won a gold medal and that gave us great pleasure, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruit as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal, contrary to every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt PiculÃ3n Ortiz.
Its numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as PiculÃ3n.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill from the boys.
What do you think is the best you achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I have introduced, such as e.g. the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce z. play only in their territory and meet teams from other corners of the island only in the national playoffs.
Today, the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy my wife Isabel's company, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21. Born in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 80s is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new squadron of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved native town of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he liked the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her journalist told Jeffrey Lane.
He enjoyed everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, witty, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumour was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Bewitching Jeannie" of the NBC television facility.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He was also a member of two comedies that were only aired for a short time, e.g. B.The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included critics rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly despicable J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS about the Ewing Clan and other characters in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot on J.R.?", was to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's character was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in competitions.
The series reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" turned into the second most widely seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others had reason to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband, who strove to let his alcohol-shame wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) instruct.
"I know what to stand on the J.R. tombstone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be said "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "innate personality on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just being filmed, the station informed.
By Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation as to how the loss of Hagmann in the series would be treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she was given to Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his fortune on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities have residing.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could harm someone or interfere with them in any wise manner," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist with anxious patient.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as B. "Don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as e.g. nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course at the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Mayan calendar on 21. December, which many people believed was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some called "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, it would be a really good period.
And he reminds that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history, courses on the "end of the world".
In Temple, sitting Professor Barry Vacker presents the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as e.g. nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple term "The End of the World".
"We are not absorbing in 2012 so that we always have the option of being able to hold prices anew in case the world does not go down," said Restall.
Despite the "pre-existing doom", students must study, create projects and take part in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, so students have no other chance but to "continue to work tonight, where the world is supposedly coming to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more places in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked whether there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers' Jews who are interested in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic cult or religion mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing declares that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard about a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less even a professor - explained to the last date of the 21st to believe in December.
"Our first project covered the Mayan prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student in Temple last year, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society, which is tracing for several centuries, when people responded to changes in their surroundings with predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"People don't think so else," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at La Salle University, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers whether he would know a course about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as a hint to an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days were spoken by the last court over the years, and said that if on 21. December nothing happens, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that the 21. December the beginning of a seven-year period is that the end of the world comes.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrate "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'm calling some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
