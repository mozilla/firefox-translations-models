Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro zone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 euro zone countries, inflation in November was higher than expected - after October&#39;s 2.6 percent, the annual inflation rate was 3.1 percent, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been for just 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered its key interest rate. In their opinion, the interest rate cut, the rising commodity prices and the slight drop in unemployment would encourage the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below 2 percent, or at least close to the 2 percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB finds itself in a quandary: inflation has to be &quot;agreed upon&quot; in order to rule out the need for action at a later date.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Rising food and energy prices are responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro zone.
MATIF wheat quotations rose 88 percent and soybean prices also hit a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in prices for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it is expected to fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
Analysts are assuming a 3 percent inflation rate for the next 3-4 months, but put the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect that the ECB will cut interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew significantly by early December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while support for the Socialists has hit an all-time low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
Among voters loyal to the party, the difference is clear thanks to the high level of determination of the opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) opposed to a fifth (20 percent) approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry hurdle: they come to two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Overall economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate since the last low - the proportion of people who rate the country&#39;s economy as &quot;extremely bad&quot; has never been higher (41 percent), while another 46 percent said it was &quot;fairly bad&quot;. &quot; hold.
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
The majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further in the coming year; only a tenth assumes an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the prime minister&#39;s work to be &quot;more of a nuisance than good&quot;.
Thirteen percent of respondents have a high level of trust or general trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without a change of government.
After the riots last October, 35% said that the government and the head of government should remain in power. Today this proportion is only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the only solution in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said they would &quot;certainly&quot; participate and another 20 percent would &quot;probably&quot; vote.
For comparison: if the parliamentary elections were held this Sunday, only 55 percent would &quot;certainly&quot; go to the polls, another 15% consider their participation &quot;probable&quot;. Given these tendencies, the outcome of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the daily hospital allowance.
Applied to the group of people who &quot;definitely&quot; took part in the referendum, the proportions of opponents of tuition, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84 and 89 percent respectively.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area this year kept the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs Trade Triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket &quot;Napi&quot; increased by 16 percent this year, however, price increases of over HUF 1,000 were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets &quot;galloped away&quot; last December, the percentage inflation was not drastic compared to the already high previous starting level.
However, consumers will certainly be put off by the fact that what they paid well under HUF 9,000 for last year is not even available for HUF 10,000 this year.
The price of the &quot;Napi&quot; basket exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF mark by at least 91 HUF in the examined markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year&#39;s level, while the prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy seeds rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there was 1kg of bread rolls for 139 forints.
The price of the product did not fall below 200 forints due to competition.
Also surprising was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of less than 200 forints, so the drink including the deposit only cost 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in this year&#39;s &quot;Napi&quot; shopping basket comparison, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations show that Cora has increased prices in the &#39;Napi&#39; basket by 15 per cent compared to last year&#39;s Christmas prices, while Tesco and Auchan have each increased by 18 per cent.
The difference between last year&#39;s cheapest basket and this year&#39;s most expensive basket was 12%, while the increase between last year&#39;s cheapest basket and this year&#39;s most expensive basket was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase last year was 1,206.00 forints, but the increase in VAT had an impact on prices last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that hit the retail trade badly: Apparently, the department stores could not quite decide which price range to apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the retailer misplans the velocity of a product, he can lose substantial profits in the price range that varies with traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the increase in price of the &quot;Napi&quot; basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
Such extremes were not observed this year, as the most expensive basket cost HUF 1,630.00 more than last year, and even the cheapest basket increased by HUF 1,284.00.
A comparison of the last two Christmas seasons showed a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily corroborate data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some staple foods, the Statistical Office found inflation of more than 30 percent over a 12-month period.
In addition to flour, this also applies to eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the &quot;Napi&quot; shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which was already expensive last year, has risen by hardly more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Flour suppliers are obviously in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to pass the drastic price increase onto the multinationals.
In the golden trading triangle, the hypermarkets don&#39;t complain; There are constant reports of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
Large quantities of everything are bought, long-life groceries go over the counters in pallets.
On Wednesday morning there were endless queues at the checkout in all three department stores when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country is reporting lower footfall, with many multinationals complaining to pollsters that they may not even be able to meet their target sales, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, savings are being made on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals that were due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to containing the infections, according to the senior doctor at the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, savings are also being made on disinfectants.
MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The man injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but the man had to return shortly afterwards with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium that is still in the patient&#39;s body.
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System from hospitals, according to the senior physician at the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were definitely registered in the hospitals, but the number of unreported cases is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
About a third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium in their nose without causing disease.
SA-related infections (such as strep throat, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if the doses of the agents are too high or used improperly, the well-responding bacteria develop into antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which spread quickly under the right conditions in the hospitals.
These bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infections or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis, particularly in patients with a weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly patients or patients with low body weight.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
The infection shouldn&#39;t be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi warned - MRSA only doesn&#39;t exist where people aren&#39;t looking for it.
Resistant to antibiotics
&quot;Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when they are cared for, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment&quot; - says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are checked for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too infrequent
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for containing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the patients admitted and immediately isolate those infected with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not so common in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this examination from the state health insurance.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the agent from developing, although hospitals do not always comply with this directive.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even rarer among outpatients or those in primary care.
Savings are made on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by caregivers.
This is precisely why washing hands or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in domestic hospitals it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are closely spaced, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, it is unfortunately the case in hospitals that are less well off financially that savings are even made on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that actually promote the development of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for the health insurance companies, which is why they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
According to the first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made preventing the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and preventing infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death Driver Sheriff wasn&#39;t drunk
In the case of the police chief of the XXII. District caused car accident with fatal outcome is now the official report.
The now resigned chief of police of the XXII. District, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, Attila Morvai, the spokesman for Budapest&#39;s chief prosecutor&#39;s office, said on Friday after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The former chief of police turned with his own car in the XXII. District into Kossuth Lajos Street and ran over a 55-year-old man who was crossing the street at an unmarked spot.
(According to the StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the driver has lower priority, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra crossing.)
The pedestrian succumbed to his injuries after being taken to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and applied for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office has launched an investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the start.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements with a total value of EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday. The money should flow into education, traffic and environmental protection infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for financing transport and environmental protection projects that are being implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement for EUR 100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement is about the use of the EUR 200 million.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be used for the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300m for this purpose in Hungary; The use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed an agreement for EUR 50 million, which will mainly go to research and development programs at the University of Debrecen.
The subway line 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with a total value of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, commission-free.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is paying close attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan country.
What, where, and who buys in what is still the cheapest market in the EU, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most sought-after place for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe at the moment, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the most popular are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, by the sea Albena, the &quot;Gold Coast&quot;, the &quot;Sun Coast&quot; and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the most popular, but real estate is located around Kavarna and Balcik also more and more in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the interior will also attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extremely cheap area of Russe will also see more buyers.
The capital Sofia also has tempting offers - retail and office space offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is well on the way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, attracting tourists in both the summer and winter seasons as well as the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy property in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski resorts have predominantly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgiy Yankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties around 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses around 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication options are very important, but proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations for Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing value in the medium to long term.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming more and more expensive due to the ever-growing demand.
Although property prices in Bulgaria are the lowest in the EU, prices have risen by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The increase in property prices far outstrips the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percents
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced that the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali roadmap, which defines the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
A fierce debate is currently underway between industrialized and developing countries.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate specific figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
The other big question at the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on assistance to developing countries was also reached.
The adjustment fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be administered by a 16-member council, presumably at the UN&#39;s Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in &quot;Piac és Profit&quot;.
Hungary&#39;s six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU&#39;s efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured from 1990 levels), regardless of whether the &#39;post-2012 deal&#39; is achieved or not. The Union would even be willing to advocate a 30 percent reduction, provided that other large industrialized countries in the world or developing countries are also willing to fulfill their obligations responsibly and to the best of their ability.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of just 5.2 percent, while the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed itself to a minus of 8%.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a target the country will certainly meet, according to the Environment Ministry&#39;s press release.
The stakes are high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement has to be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not come into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects laid down in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed by a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also emphasized by the IPCC, the international scientific committee on climate change of the UN, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, in its most recent report.
This would delay emission reductions and make it inevitable that the earth&#39;s average temperature would rise by more than 2°C, with extremely serious and irreversible consequences, according to scientists.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: since March 2006, special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban to the Internet, reports the BBC.
Filmed with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, the footage is checked at Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where it will be posted on the internet.
Political message unavoidable
Luftwaffe soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, and their &quot;channel&quot; has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under &quot;defenceheadquarters&quot; in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq also have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and the Department of Defense says the posts also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of the foreign missions.
Propaganda released in this way is almost free of charge compared to traditional television advertising, defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain level of political message, as they in their own way confirm the raison d&#39;être of the military measures decided upon by the government.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army also has to fight against amateur footage that, along with the carefully edited, censored footage, also makes it onto the Internet - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: the somewhat hypocritical, &quot;official&quot; propaganda films only talk about the casualties, however, the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Incidentally, numerous videos shot in action from the theaters of war in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British only recently discovered this &quot;genre&quot; for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game &quot;America&#39;s Army&quot;, in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier within the framework of a more or less lifelike simulation.
Christmas party with raffle and pogache in the ministries
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she is organizing a labor conference where her employees can round off the year 2007 with coffee and scones.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up a Christmas spirit with a raffle or a toast to the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already caught the authorities.
The biggest Christmas party of a ministry this year will be held in the defense department, but the ministry&#39;s employees are not expected to attend.
The &quot;Orphans&#39; Christmas Party&quot; will give gifts to children of fallen soldiers, the &quot;Mission Day Celebration&quot; will entertain family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there will also be a reception for the press.
The department is making around 25 million available for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport are going overboard.
The Ministry of Economy&#39;s HUF 4.32 million Christmas party will be held in the House of the Future, and around 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
While the focus of the celebrations will be Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle draw.
The National Agency for Development (NFU) held its HUF 4.7 million Christmas party on Wednesday at the National Judicial Council (OIT) building, complete with concerts and a celebratory meal.
The hall rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas party organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Center (MAG Zrt) with EU funds.
The building of the Comedy Theater (&quot;Vígszínház&quot;) was rented for the celebration.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the people in charge.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7th.
They did not have to pay any rent to the OIT for using the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, and after dinner there was live music for dancing.
At the request of [origo], the following was announced: There was no obligation to wear a ball gown or suit at the ball.
The Departments of Health, Labor, and Home Government are each preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forints.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is not officially inviting her employees to a Christmas party, but to a conference at the end of the year.
About 180 guests are expected, who - according to the press department - will only be entertained with coffee and scones, so the celebration will cost 350,000 forints.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply toast in the ministry&#39;s auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas party in its own ballroom, to which 436 employees are expected.
Spending was measured at 2,500 forints per head - for this money there is a buffet reception followed by a toast.
Since the beginning of János Veres&#39; tenure, PM staff have celebrated in this way every year.
However, there won&#39;t be a real party atmosphere - not only because of the minister&#39;s official speech but also because the celebration has been scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year&#39;s reception on January 20th, the Christmas party of the Ministry is canceled this time.
One hundred guests are invited to Vajdahunyad Castle in City Park (&quot;Városliget&quot;); according to information from the department, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and end with a restrained feast.
As reported by the relevant press offices on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebrations either at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the cost of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment was unable to provide any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is being held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for a giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation formed their coordinating committee on Friday for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
A large protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and work stoppages will begin on Monday - the day of the referendum on the health insurance law.
Significant traffic delays caused by the strike are expected, as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport company (BKV) will also be on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday&#39;s strike will be announced jointly by the League of Unions and the Federation of Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday&#39;s actions.
A mass protest meeting will be held on Saturday and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will be on hold indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that started on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss how to proceed.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the vote on the health insurance law will only take place later in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strikes beginning on Monday will result in significant traffic disruptions: the railway workers will stop working for an indefinite period of time, and in the morning most public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be at a standstill.
At the same time, there will be motorway closures in one direction in many places.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations followed the call for a strike - the list of participants is continuously updated on the league website.
Some organizations have announced strikes for an indefinite period, while others are planning a temporary work stoppage.
As of Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian Railways MÁV and the Free Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZ on adequate services, although more and more people are traveling by train around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, there will be strikes at the BKV from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy will stop working for four hours, and the teachers&#39; union bwz. the Democratic Teachers&#39; Union have called for 2 and 2-8 hour strikes respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes alternately at different times across the country, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Welfare Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and present a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due next year.
Demand number three is that the professional groups entitled to claim should have access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, did not accept the offer made by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and is now demanding a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases sovereign risk
According to Political Capital&#39;s Risk Analyzing Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, established this August with the support of the &quot;Movement for a Better Hungary&quot;, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute&#39;s &quot;Risk Warning Report&quot; states, among other things: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guards, the highest political risk represents the &quot;exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which even in the short term can become violent could lead to ethnic disputes&quot;.
According to the research institute, the main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guards, which is probably aimed at provoking such a confrontation.
As reported, this is seen as an omission on the part of the political leaders: &quot;Public figures have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now based their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary antagonism&quot;.
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make rational dialogue impossible, favor extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent confrontations.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guards, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, have &quot;significantly damaged Hungary&#39;s image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity&quot;.
We remember: since autumn 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been on the upswing, so that since summer 2007 several organizations calling themselves &quot;national self-defence associations&quot; have been founded.
&quot;What these groups have in common is that they define themselves as civilian organisations, while openly boasting that they are preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (disaster control, national defence, law enforcement), citing the incompetence of the police, the army and the police, respectively of the state itself,&quot; it said.
And further: All of this happens according to the method that tries to disguise various political efforts based on the population&#39;s disenchantment with politics and parties as civil initiatives.
The emphasis on the civilian character and the form of the association not only serve to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of the registration at the court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard represent a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighboring countries.
&quot;In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighboring countries, with some ultra-nationalist politicians in certain neighboring countries seeing the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policies.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region&quot; - it said.
From the Research Institute&#39;s point of view, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central-East Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Polyana) were behind the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard.
The BNU took the incidents as an opportunity to set up the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization was &quot;national protection&quot;.
In her opinion, a downright &quot;gypsy terror&quot; was noticeable in Bulgaria in the past 17 years, but the state remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have triggered a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to Political Capital&#39;s risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, told the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-changing tendencies become apparent, public opinion would be informed, as in the case through the issuance of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not public holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of rescheduling the working days around the public holidays has now become established, but the coming year will bring us fewer such days.
In the EU and America, too, &quot;holiday&quot; means something else.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Non-working days are mostly church holidays or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are non-working days - the latter alone so that those celebrating New Year&#39;s Eve can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen public holidays.
National holidays are March 15, commemorating the 1848 revolution, and October 23, commemorating the 1956 revolution.
The founding of the state is celebrated on August 20th, work is celebrated on May 1st, and we commemorate our dead on November 1st and 2nd.
In addition, there are two public holidays each at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of &quot;working day shifting&quot; has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the long weekends is that we have to work or go to school on the Saturdays before.
When this day, which falls before or after the public holiday, should ultimately be processed, has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labor in a separate ordinance.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants alike.
The only exceptions are companies and institutions in which operations continue without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays.
This year, the only thing that messes up the work regulations is the holidays at the end of the year: From December 24th, life in this country literally comes to a standstill, as most people take time off in lieu for the days between Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve, or take the vacation that was specifically set aside for this purpose.
Next year there will be more public holidays in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer rescheduling of the working days than this year.
The calendar is first &quot;turned upside down&quot; around Labor Day so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday April 26th will be a working day so that Friday May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second rescheduling is related to the public holiday on October 23: On Saturday, October 18, you will have to work through Friday, October 24 in advance.
However, the end of the year will be marked by the holidays after everything stops and stops from December 24th, even if New Year&#39;s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy co-workers
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring &quot;color&quot; to everyday life at work.
The only question is whether you get used to these small inconveniences, or do you better face the challenge and consciously try to avoid these misleading, annoying situations for others.
tips.
&quot;Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called,&quot; says a colleague.
Missing a meeting as a result?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it, perhaps by calling the marketing department and ruefully admitting you forgot to target the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before you get tangled up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can do to create truly unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Borrowed something that doesn&#39;t belong to you?
There&#39;s nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, stationery, or phone, but it&#39;s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - is it gone this morning?
Or is the ballpoint pen you thought lost discovered on a colleague&#39;s desk?
You shouldn&#39;t borrow anything from your colleagues without asking, because they are right to get annoyed when they realize that something has been lost.
So, don&#39;t put any envelopes or post-its from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you: none left when you need them urgently.
Gossip about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop gossip that has already started.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
If possible, one should not foist information (or assumptions) about the private lives of colleagues on everyone!
And if someone does open up and reveals their innermost secret to us, we shouldn&#39;t abuse this trust!
It&#39;s best to be as silent as the grave instead of telling someone who isn&#39;t there, even if others also know about the colleague&#39;s problems.
Called in sick for no reason?
When you call the office to call in sick because you&#39;re unwell, citing a nagging headache, or you just want to rest, there&#39;s one thing to be clear about: your own work, urgent errands, projects with fixed ones Appointments now have to be made by colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don&#39;t play along badly with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won&#39;t be able to make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up that will make you have to stay at home, you should report it in good time so that neither your colleagues nor your boss unexpectedly announce your absence be confronted.
Humming, giggling, talking on the phone
Are you engrossed in your work, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of your colleagues?
Unintentionally overheard a phone conversation that you shouldn&#39;t have heard?
Don&#39;t annoy co-workers with humming, chanting, loud conversations (held over their heads), stomping, constant scolding, or nagging.
All of this can be very disruptive, even if they are not engrossed in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other person&#39;s fault?
If a project is not finished on time, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important message, you should not blame others for your own forgetfulness!
If possible, you should not excuse yourself from the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected by them too!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or make up for lost time is only too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slippers: Comfortable for at home, but has no place in the office!
You shouldn&#39;t even dress so casually if the workplace actually allows it!
Just don&#39;t get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself enough to dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make it all right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop-and-go traffic, the car in the middle of a morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
The tempo changes, the bass comes along with the previous sounds, and as a real jewel of sound, a female choir.
It&#39;s the song &quot;Wings of Love&quot; by Zagar that plays on mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene hasn&#39;t exactly spoiled us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see traffic jams differently when listening to Zagar&#39;s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the local digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if garage rock with its squeaking guitars is &quot;in&quot; again, local electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started out in Pécs, played in the band Yonderboi himself, before - perhaps because a tavern couldn&#39;t stand two whistlers - began to forge his own path.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which fuses elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, only came when he was asked to compose the soundtrack for a film (eg
&quot;Szezon&quot; by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which initially performed in smaller clubs, only became known to a wider audience when the magazine &quot;wan2&quot; ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only one, too marketable trendsetter in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were &quot;trendy,&quot; but nobody cared if they actually liked wearing the brand.
The band reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album that has just been released with the title &quot;Cannot Walk Fly Instead&quot; could open up new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be okay, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and trends - and the influences of rock&#39;n&#39;roll are noticeable.
The singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band &quot;The Puzzle&quot;, introduced himself with these songs at the premiere in the Millenáris.
One song from the album even made it into a radio hit - mr2 Petőfi, who has recently been broadcasting pop music from dawn to dusk, gave listeners the song &quot;Wings of Love&quot;, which was recorded with the participation of six local singers (&quot;Underground Divas&quot;). successively set the catchy tune.
So everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain class?
Balázs Zságer: The term &quot;shift music&quot; doesn&#39;t mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two castes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and bland, but it can also just as well be produced for sale that makes it commercial music.
Even a good pop number can come from an honest motive.
The receptiveness of the listener also works according to this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, especially to the west of us.
Not only teenagers or twenty-somethings go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They pay much more attention to the trends in popular music happening around them because they also see them as a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it&#39;s a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is mostly felt at the concerts, where there is already mutual interaction, but that, again, is only in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, one thing struck me: if you want to please everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow Yonderboi&#39;s example?
He travels as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don&#39;t really go his way, quite apart from the fact that people keep trying to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves more as team players who trust in each other&#39;s musical presence and let it unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons between our work and Yonderboi&#39;s were unavoidable, since several of us come from his band and have taken a different path.
hvg.hu: In mr2 Petőfi&#39;s charts &quot;Wings of Love&quot; is number one.
Many only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was opening up to a wider audience intentionally staged with a slightly more popular style?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then serve as the driving force for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the orgy of sound and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to create a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of assembling the choir from talented soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir came about - meaning Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later dubbed &quot;Underground Divas&quot;.
hvg.hu: Did you want the song to be the same, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: The number had existed in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number &quot;needed something&quot;.
The chord progression literally called for a voice.
I sang the melody that same night, later the girls learned it.
Everything came almost instantly and was shockingly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was quite electrified at the time, but the &quot;Divas&quot; were also needed.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, you got the impression that the girls were in the background.
There&#39;s no solo part (apart from Judy Jay&#39;s brief solo), they don&#39;t have a role of their own, they sing totally together and aren&#39;t louder than the music, so their singing isn&#39;t just accompanied by the music.
They also stood at the back of the stage.
Is it on purpose?
B.Zs.: The fact that you stood at the back was due to purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately didn&#39;t want to give them any solo roles.
The song is also about forgetting your ego a little bit, forgetting who came from where and going where, let&#39;s just let those particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel that euphoric state that we felt while making the song.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none at all, there were more difficult tasks in the mixing.
For example on &quot;Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma&quot;, in which I play a concert piano, or on &quot;Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls&quot;, where the groove didn&#39;t want to work for a long time, but gradually everything came together, like with a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite track from the new album?
B. Zs.: That keeps changing with the concerts and also now that I&#39;ve &quot;let go&quot; of the album.
Currently it&#39;s &quot;Prophet Is A Fool&quot;, &quot;Escape From The Earth&quot; and the number &quot;Never The Same&quot;.
Fraudulent broker risked billions over feelings of inferiority
Bottomless scammer
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka, describes his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of him, she came to almost five billion euros.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do the same as his peers, but was certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all major banks, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
&quot;He&#39;s mentally rather weak,&quot; was what his superiors said when they reported him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel&#39;s statements published by the French media, such as the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had made profits of 1.6 billion euros from his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
&quot;All I wanted was to make money for my bank,&quot; he claims in his statement.
In the summer he managed to earn half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He had already spotted the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was early news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had previous payment problems, would run into trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn&#39;t believe that and was right.
At the end of the year he had increased his profits to 1.6 billion euros.
&quot;Even when I made the first half billion, I didn&#39;t know how to explain it,&quot; admits Kerviel, going on to say that he definitely didn&#39;t keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents so that he would not be caught.
He even managed to dupe his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually took an interest in his business.
risk profit
Was he afraid of flying?
Hardly likely.
&quot;I thought she was satisfied with the mere fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank.&quot;
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to earn his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
&quot;I knew from my first conversation in 2005 that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development,&quot; Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after he joined, the first big success came.
He made a lot of money with Allianz shares by betting half a billion euros on losses of this stock during the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you&#39;re making a profit, we&#39;ll let you
&quot;It&#39;s like a snowball,&quot; he told police officers.
But the bosses supposedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
&quot;As long as I was making money, people closed their eyes.&quot;
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find out about him?
He made himself suspicious by going on vacation.
&quot;I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn&#39;t take vacations is one who doesn&#39;t want their cards looked at,&quot; concluded Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has a chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission yesterday signed a total of nine development programs that could bring the Czech Republic EUR 14 billion (about CZK 365 billion) over the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the &quot;Enterprise and Innovation&quot; program.
Most of the money, around 150 billion, will flow into the expansion of traffic.
The transport program is the largest development program and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money will correspondingly increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation program is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative ventures.
The companies are supposed to gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful of the new accession countries when it comes to acquiring money from EU funds.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for ex-president
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld former President Arnold Alemán&#39;s 20-year prison sentence after he was sentenced in 2003 to a $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion kroner) financial fraud charge.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda near the Nicuruan metropolis.
According to the AP news agency, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American country will be behind bars again.
According to the head of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether Alemán is allowed to serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, a court proved that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money ended up in a fund Alemán set up to finance his 2001 campaign.
Budget is through
Yes, it&#39;s done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this household?
It is the first budget this government has drafted that has been approved by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats), because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had submitted it and the ČSSD could not therefore afford to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate that preceded the vote on the motion of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives calmly approved this traditionally neglected but highly significant law.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is obscured by the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
This is a more rewarding topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate all at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are obligatory by law, not only pensions but also social expenditures, which the &quot;silent&quot; coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections has decided.
The second is the deficit budget policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third constraint is the public finance deficits, ie the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the biggest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and reasonably under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
In order to tap other sources of investment besides income from taxes, levies and bank loans, many mayors often thoughtlessly issued bonds, which left their town halls excessively indebted.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off this debt through mass sales of shares in the energy and other utility grids that they received from the state in the course of privatization.
Now that source has already dried up.
As far as we only stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth for several years, which ČSSD constantly boasts about.
This presented a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments indebted the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge shame, largely attributable to previous governments.
We are among the countries least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for any wet social programs, which unfortunately have been inflated to gigantic proportions in a completely unnecessary way, especially in the last few years.
While it has managed to scrap some of the nonsensical populist spending passed ahead of this year&#39;s elections, it&#39;s clear that unless there&#39;s a shift in the retirement age and pension reform in the near future, virtually all will end Politics in this country and whoever is in power will be left with nothing but administration.
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that ruling politicians will then become civil servants who mechanically split most of the tax revenue between pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year&#39;s budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The deficit of 70 billion kroner planned for 2008 would be quite redundant if previous governments had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
If we don&#39;t want ruling politicians to become purely administrative officials, then we have to be patient and this coalition government, which is not too strong but is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can is able to collect taxes and fees, wants peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable a gradual implementation of a balanced national budget.

Banks want to overcome the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will enter the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction off interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed is sending 40 billion dollars up for auction, and making another 24 billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
After the September 11 attacks, this is the first time that the central banks of the individual countries have agreed on such a coordinated approach to avert or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
&quot;This move is designed to address the economy&#39;s biggest problem, which is the growing lack of discretionary capital for banks to lend,&quot; wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group consultancy in a report for his clients.
&quot;Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a US recession from 65% to about 50%,&quot; Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost about $60 billion on delinquent loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions in losses.
&quot;Central banks must have been really scared of what is to come when they decided to do this,&quot; said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
&quot;It looks like the situation is really bad,&quot; he continued.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing bonds, credit will also become more expensive for their customers.
That would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into recession, potentially affecting economic growth around the world.
Central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for interbank lending.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend to each other, even though central banks in the US, Canada and the UK cut interest rates several times during the autumn.
&quot;It will have the same effect as another cut in interest rates,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this move by central banks is contributing to the heating up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the US housing market.
Klaus: Debates by ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the international UN conference on climate change in Bali, which was coming to an end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book &quot;A Blue, No Green Planet,&quot; he explained that the ecologists&#39; debates were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, what is unacceptable is not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of government and non-governmental representatives, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and reality.
&quot;The debate there is unstructured, it&#39;s a firework of words that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems,&quot; said Klaus.
Presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that the subject matter was very important to him and that is why he was so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction that his book was appearing in a German translation because &quot;I often come across caricatures of my views.&quot;
Interested parties could now read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus reminded that he is not a climatologist, but in his opinion he has sufficient qualifications to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and assess technical papers, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main message of the book he called the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no unanimous opinion among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too big and serious and therefore none posed a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development were superfluous, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Furthermore, as someone who has had experience of totalitarian systems, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others, which he sees as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against &quot;reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.&quot;
Klaus had spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver&#39;s licenses
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver&#39;s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day to apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new driver&#39;s license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid driving license will take to the streets after the New Year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who no longer want to drive have not exchanged their driving licences.
While small towns are reporting a sharp drop in interest in driver&#39;s license exchanges, the capital&#39;s offices are being showered with applications and interest in the exchange grew even more this week.
The city administration processes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to queue for about half an hour.
Around 140,000 drivers in Prague have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to issue a new driver&#39;s license.
But it is possible to apply for the issuance with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay an additional 500 crowns.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange by the end of the year and drive off without a valid driver&#39;s license are threatened with a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also leave it at that with a warning.
In case of violation, the fine can increase to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, even those who do not drive at all can be fined by the municipality.
It was said that he could face a fine of up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the authorities to be lenient and to impose a maximum fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, nobody is threatened with a thousand crown fine.
The driver&#39;s license is a document that everyone can decide whether they want to have or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver&#39;s license.
All you have to do is take it to the competent municipal office or send it there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers are gradually having to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driver&#39;s licenses from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
Driving licenses issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this involves about 2.6 million other driver&#39;s licenses.
Court lowers sentences for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of collusion with David Berdych&#39;s gang, received 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced her sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives from the &quot;Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime&quot; were threatened with 14 and 12 years, respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today&#39;s verdict, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself has also been charged in this matter, he is facing the first instance verdict.
In other processes, however, he had already received sentences totaling 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to more.
A district court in January found 19 people guilty, primarily of involvement in robberies, and the higher regional court today heard the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the indictment from the outset, claiming it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, police officers, in collusion with Berdych, among others, gave criminals information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to evade prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík with 30 percent of the loot.
The charges relate to crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also official usurpation and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser scope and a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robberies.
Besides nearly 20 men in this case, courts finally found Berdych and a number of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from Berdych&#39;s circle have to answer in another process, other cases have not yet reached the court.
So far, Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting the final decision on their extradition for criminal prosecution in the Czech Republic, have escaped trial.
Switched children - bill: 12 million
The lawyer for the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation of 12 million crowns plus court costs from the hospital in Třebíč for the swapping of children in a maternity hospital.
Three million each for the mothers, two million each for the fathers and one million each for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each pair of parents.
The hospital&#39;s legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, therefore completely disagrees with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We reject such a proposal, it is far too high,&quot; said Dostál after today&#39;s hearing.
&quot;But in order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the report that the other side had prepared.
We&#39;ll see if it has any meaningful value at all.
But we insist that it should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone together,&quot; emphasized Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba used an expert report that the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him as the basis for compensation negotiations.
According to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the children&#39;s parents suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying degrees and depths.
The men tolerated the stressful situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the mix-up of the newborns.
The women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the after-effects of the trauma they have experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola swapped nurses at the maternity hospital in Třebíč on December 9 last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
The district governor of Vysočina (Bohemian-Moravian Highlands) gave each family 100,000 crowns in late October as compensation for expenses incurred by the mistake of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured against liability.
If in doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they apply for help from the provider.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low amounts of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the &quot;Kingdom of Wallachia&quot; trademark.
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name &quot;King of Wallachia&quot;, but the project was built up over many years by a team led by Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Polívka did not take part in the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is unlikely to be over and his client is likely to appeal.
&quot;The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to take a parasitic part in the popularity of Bolek Polívka,&quot; Polívka&#39;s lawyer said after the hearing.
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian when they heard the words &quot;Kingdom of Wallachia&quot;.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
&quot;We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities,&quot; he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute over money.
&quot;After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it too.
They want to gain parasitically on our work,&quot; he said.
lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term &quot;King of Wallachia&quot; for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
At the time, however, this was not related to the intention of founding a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
What started out as a fun activity turned into a business and entrepreneurial activity, to which Harabiš then established the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports, and even offered their owners discounts on visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the mere idea that Polívka publicized in the program &quot;Manege&quot; for his business intentions.
&quot;Polívka&#39;s popularity certainly helped the Wallachian kingdom project,&quot; said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project is Harabiš and his team, who are deeply devoted to it.
Cooperation between today&#39;s quarreling parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized Polívka&#39;s official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to pile up, culminating in the dismissal of &quot;King Boleslav I elected until the day of the Lord&quot;.
At the suggestion of Harabiš, Jarmila Šuláková took the leading role as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
The competition for the throne and half a princess prepared by Harabiš could bring clarity to the dispute.
From this a new king should emerge.
Details and a date he did not want to reveal.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal procession in Wallachia.
The king should be elected for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also register,&quot; added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices disappear
To tell the truth, I&#39;ve never been a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market and it&#39;s a whole lot better.
The station wagon labeled SW is a step further, and I only have to change my mind.
For example, when I tested the classic 207 hatchback, I had to complain about the lack of headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that even two-meter men will not suffer.
Go on quick
I&#39;ll only briefly go through the interior fittings so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is quite a successful design, where I only have objections because of the puny center tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and gone are the days when we might complain about seats that were too short or headrests that were too short.
Lateral support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the body here.
In the station wagon, the already mentioned lack of headroom is eliminated.
suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the cargo space.
I have to describe it (also because of the hinged rear window) as very easy to load and space-saving.
The cavities are fitted with tethers which are an ideal compromise.
They don&#39;t get in the way, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let&#39;s talk about the load volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle in this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we see that the Peugeot lags behind by a noticeable 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller.
But to emphasize the positives, I have to mention the very flat cargo area after folding the rear seats or the very low loading sill.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and an output of 88 kW.
And frankly, this is what a 1600cc engine powering a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
When I compare it to its Škoda counterpart, which sometimes seems like its exhaust pipe is clogged with a rag, I cannot but be amazed by it.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine is 329,900 crowns.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kronor, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car again costs 80,000 crowns.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper activation, electric windows in the rear and and...
So the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That&#39;s a lot, but add up the extras on a Fabia and you&#39;ll end up with a very similar sum.
So all that remains is to decide which brand to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes fears among the locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools are even noticing instances where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original residents are escalating in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where disputes between the natives and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Quarrels, bullying, and scuffles among students have spilled over into parental relationships.
The situation has gotten to the point where police in Chatham arrested a Slovakian woman who had hit a 10-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy had insulted her with racist abuse.
The police also had to intervene after two underage girls attacked a Slovakian immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks towards the man and threw stones at him.
&quot;As we were walking home, a boy climbed onto a bus shelter and spat on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us and then bared his buttocks,&quot; a mother of Slovakian students described another uncomfortable incident to The Times newspaper.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that tensions between natives and immigrants in British schools are becoming increasingly tense.
70,000 Slovaks are registered in Great Britain who came here looking for work.
Around 30,000 Slovakian students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you want from your vacation, it will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea as calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kite surfing, golf and roulette.
You&#39;ll find that in abundance on the islands of the Caribbean.
But you will only find so much more on one island, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for conquering America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana was once a warehouse or transit camp for treasures looted by the Spaniards in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 20th century.
One of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it built, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings grew in Havana, cars drove along the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and he had his yacht in Cojímar.
Show business stars and politicians from across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You too can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the bar in the Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed for you according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the 1950s still drive around in Havana to this day, because the once-imported shigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty, humid air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, may be very run-down, but nowhere else in the area will you find so many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being spruced up, for example Trinidad.
With tourism bringing much-needed money, this development was given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have appeared not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another quirk that is unique in the world and that attracts railway enthusiasts in particular.
The sugar cane from remote plantations was brought to the sugar factories by steam and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives whose contemporaries have long been in museums elsewhere.
destinations
Most of the visitors to Cuba do not miss the most important places.
So you no longer have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Suffice it to say that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway estate, which should not be missed if you like this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, fertile soil has accumulated in their cavities, through which even weathered rock areas are covered with dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet him in his final form if you visit one of Havana&#39;s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the TV series &quot;Major Zeman&quot; was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Trading in slaves and sugar brought her fame and fortune.
The wealth was embodied in the neat beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has changed little in four hundred years.
Trinidad, nestled between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that as recently as the 1950s there was no road connecting the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped it go unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished either, everyone was happy that they had a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth visiting interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the &quot;Valley of the Sugar Mills&quot;.
In the evening, go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after dark and where the music doesn&#39;t stop until morning.
Baracoa
This little town in the far east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading there from Guantánamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape that has hardly been touched by human intervention.
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its World Heritage List thanks to its untouched nature.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was made about a hundred years after Columbus&#39; voyages), and from the hill where the former castle stands, the current Hotel El Castillo to see several mesas, of which El Yunque is the best known.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos island, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion which the descendants of slaves profess, many pages could be written about all this.
But, as the saying goes: Better to see it with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment are affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
In Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have units stationed in the south of the country agreed that the mission in Afghanistan was not going according to plan.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, has called on NATO units to be more active, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development aid as a priority.
&quot;Forward development is palpable in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is enabling residents to start economic and security development themselves,&quot; Defense Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the US army, Afghan insurgent activity has reached its highest level in five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and by as much as 60 percent in southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
&quot;We&#39;re going to have to seriously think about the specific goals for the period ahead and how we&#39;re going to achieve them,&quot; Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made a similar statement today.
&quot;I&#39;m not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that&#39;s not enough,&quot; De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
who is passive
There has also been a dispute among the countries involved in recent months as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for being passive.
&quot;The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat demands for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country,&quot; Gates said.
The British tabloid &quot;Sun&quot; this week described the German soldiers as lazybones.
&quot;Afghan idlers exposed: Germans play games while our boys fight,&quot; wrote the Sun in an article supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany&#39;s Bild newspaper counterattacked, reprinting a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
National debt will skyrocket to 1 trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion konen this year.
However, in early December, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
As a result, they rose by 40.2 billion in the first nine months of this year.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year as a whole, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
&quot;So far it seems that thanks to the lower deficit next year, we may not cross the 1 trillion kroner mark until 2009.
Next year the debt should range from 900 billion to 1 trillion crowns,&quot; Patria Finance analyst David Marek told the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, sees it similarly: &quot;We could reach over one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next household, which we don&#39;t know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing and politicians are willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don&#39;t expect that to change,&quot; he noted.
debt grows
The national debt stems from the debt of the state government and mainly comes from the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by Treasury bills, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic national debt rose to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The state&#39;s foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kronor at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
&quot;Total debt increased 13 percent for the year from Q1 to Q3, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It&#39;s bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before pension reform comes,&quot; Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and handling of the public debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kronor this year.
However, in early December, thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount stems mainly from the state budget deficit, which this year is expected to reach 76 billion crowns instead of the projected 91.3 billion.
There are also maximum budgeted funds for the Consolidation Agency in the amount of 13.3 billion crowns, a 10 billion reserve for paying pensions, the financing of state bonds for 43 billion and installments for loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion.
She was brought before a court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and subsequent deportation by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The Briton has been accused of allowing six to seven-year-old schoolchildren to name a teddy bear Mahomet, despite a ban on any depiction of the Islamic prophet.
She deserved to be whipped.
The 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Khartoum&#39;s Unity High School, was arrested at her home on Sunday after parents of students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education on several occasions and was charged under Article 125 of Sudan&#39;s Penal Code with insulting Islam.
In fact, this affair begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
&quot;The children suggested eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,&quot; reports principal Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for the class with the photo of the bear on it and the caption “My name is Mohammed”.
The bear itself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simply that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons&#39; Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she had never done anything to offend a religious belief, &quot;My only regret is that she lost the children asked to vote for a name”, in his view this is just an “innocent mistake”.
An opinion shared by many of the teacher&#39;s students, who describe her as &quot;very attentive to her students&quot; and &quot;a person who never talks about religion in class&quot;.
Note that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common middle name in Britain, with 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a form of homage to the Prophet (it is often given to the firstborn in a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
At the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
In the end the failure
Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, unable to settle their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
&quot;It is regrettable that the parties could not come to an agreement on the status,&quot; said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner, called on Belgrade and Pristina to honor their commitments to keep the peace and to continue talks beyond the end of negotiations.
&quot;No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time,&quot; he added, indicating that there are clear tensions.
Conciliation ends on December 10th
The mediators of the troika, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet one last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian-speaking, could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika received a mandate from the UN last August for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on December 10th.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council&#39;s approval of Kosovo&#39;s independence, are insisting that negotiations continue beyond this end date.
&quot;Russia was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, an amicable solution,&quot; Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo under UN administration, Western countries believe independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
&quot;Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached,&quot; announced the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden, where these &quot;last-chance negotiations&quot; have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan proposed by Belgrade &quot;belongs to a past that led to killings and deportations&quot;.
&quot;Domino effect&quot;
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought and warned the Kosovar Albanian majority of the consequences of the province&#39;s unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a &quot;domino effect&quot; in a region still so weak from the independence wars of the 1990s.
&quot;For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible,&quot; he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be made solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto power.
“The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word”
&quot;Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,&quot; said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to the journalists that &quot;Kosovo&#39;s parliament will have the final say on status,&quot; adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population would be done &quot;in coordination&quot; with western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
Opening the international peace conference he chaired in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He went on to say that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In front of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them reach a &quot;peace deal&quot; before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy &quot;the terrorist infrastructures&quot; and Israel must halt its colonization efforts, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the &quot;road map&quot; for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim at a peace deal that should resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including key ones.&quot;
This designation encompasses the three major issues around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who fled their homeland in the course of the 1948 conflict and who live in the present-day state Israel lies, were expelled.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations would be “full and thorough” and would settle all issues, including “Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security listed.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted &quot;directly and without interruption&quot; and that he would endeavor to complete them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the end of 2008 as the deadline for realizing his &quot;vision of two states,&quot; one Palestinian and one Israeli, coexisting.
Saudi Arabia disclosed that it received an assurance to that effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a major success for Washington, has launched a plan, shared by all Arab countries, that offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war , including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,&quot; said the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Arabic-language daily, which is financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are juxtaposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel in the direction of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
&quot;He wasn&#39;t on duty, but he was on patrol and was driving at 40-50 km/h without flashing lights,&quot; explains a police spokesman.
A green Kawasaki motorbike, &quot;unlicensed, i.e. not approved for use on public roads&quot; (see below), was driven by two youths without helmets and drove up &quot;at very high speed&quot;.
&quot;It rammed the left side of the police car after ignoring its right-of-way,&quot; a police officer said.
The alcohol test carried out on the vehicle passengers was negative.
The condition of the car (dented fender, shattered windshield, ripped off bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the &quot;facts of involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger&quot;, in coordination with of the Val-d&#39;Oise public safety department.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that investigating the IGPN at this stage excludes the responsibility of the police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident who were heard on Sunday evening &quot;confirmed the version of the police officers, namely that this moped came to her left side relatively quickly&quot;.
Yesterday some sort of rutting, no doubt caused by the friction of the footpegs on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained locked together until the police officers managed to brake.
The vehicles have been impounded and will be the subject of a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened after that?
A rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel yesterday that the police officers left the scene of the accident very quickly and did so without helping the two young people.
While the IGPN remains very cautious, it would rule out &quot;any serious error&quot; on this matter as well.
According to a police source, &quot;This is a difficult aspect of the investigation that requires further investigation and very careful handling&quot;.
Liberation met an eyewitness to those few moments shortly after the accident.
He had a direct view of the scene from one of his windows.
&quot;We immediately went outside with my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive her,&quot; says this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw “a completely disturbed police officer who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth was on the phone.
Given the tension that quickly built up around what had happened and, apparently, due to the certainty that those present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
Still according to the testimony, rescue workers arrived &quot;approximately twenty minutes after the police officers left.&quot;
They have also used heart massage, but to no avail.
&quot;I will not allow it to be said that the police forces failed to provide assistance to the youths.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire department came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her,&quot; said the prosecutor.
Tension is mounting in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, around 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the state of emergency measures in the eastern city of Lahore were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials there.
They then threw stones, injuring the police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar Association have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a spate of around 500 arrests of opposition figures, human rights advocates and lawyers over the weekend.
Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations took place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers&#39; movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal coalition, whose president &quot;urged the population to send flowers to judges who have spoken out against the state of emergency and rubbish to those who... took an oath before Musharraf.
&quot;Musharraf&#39;s promise is no longer valid&quot;
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the days that followed, he had to comment on the legality of President Musharraf&#39;s re-election in a direct ballot on October 6th.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
&quot;Everything we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court,&quot; the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf&#39;s promise to step down as commander of the army and become a civilian president &quot;is no longer valid&quot; since the state of emergency was declared, Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to turn in his military uniform by November 15, the date when his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied rumors circulating in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy military leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Law, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) are still unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception, such as the pill or the IUD, still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of women between 20 and 40 who take the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless allowed better &quot;fertility control&quot;. .
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
For one in five couples, even calculated to the month and, if possible, in spring, the time of year when it seems most comfortable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a faulty solar panel, essential for continued scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records for its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized and the tools &quot;tinkered&quot; by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem emerged on Wednesday when the astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical piece that will soon house the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of jetty for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the crew&#39;s second task was to move a 17.5-tonne solar power generation module already on the ISS to its final position.
After relocating it, the crew set about restructuring the module&#39;s solar panels, the span of which is 76 meters.
And it so happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded out like accordions, was damaged by a pinched cable over a length of about a meter
The restructuring has been stopped to avoid further damage to the collector.
The astronauts, who were originally assigned to disembark the space shuttle Discovery for a tour of inspection and then repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the space shuttle&#39;s 100-foot-long remote-controlled arm that had been attached to the station&#39;s to perform the repair.
He&#39;s one of NASA&#39;s top spacewalkers.
Tall, resilient, very agile, he has a well-developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to &quot;operate&quot; on the &quot;injured&quot; solar panel.
After carefully examining the damage, he severed the faulty cable and attached a type of splint to the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second &quot;spacewalker&quot; who stayed near the airlock and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, crew commander.
The tool he used, a miniature hockey stick wrapped in insulator to prevent electrocution on the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, was dreamed up and &quot;tinkered&quot; by the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was complete, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting off his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the Space Shuttle Discovery today for a flight back to Earth, which is expected on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the A400M&#39;s backlog, EADS shares are currently showing a sharp fall on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS is currently losing 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to reassess its business forecasts for 2007 in light of the backlog caused by slow development of the A400M&#39;s engine, which is delaying the aircraft&#39;s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to &quot;between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus,&quot; announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
These costs will force EADS to announce new operating performance (EBIT) targets for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without giving further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, EADS&#39; business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, that of the very large A380 carrier aircraft.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
The counting of the ballot boxes on Sunday won&#39;t be exciting: the majority of Russians will vote for President Putin&#39;s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she reconfirmed her quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed a message to voters broadcast on public channels, which was already recorded but the content was kept secret.
He does so in his capacity as the lead candidate of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is poised for a resounding victory.
Yesterday the President kept his mouth shut as he received the foreign ambassadors, content to provide a new vulnerability against the Western powers accused of meddling - his favorite issue during the election campaign.
&quot;We know the price of a true democracy and we hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,&quot; he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they made a mistake.
She denounces an election campaign tainted by repression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there were &quot;never such dirty elections, not even in the Eltsin era.&quot;
After last weekend&#39;s suppression of demonstrations, ex-world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrating, is still banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
&quot;The Russians have retained the mentality of homo sovieticus&quot;
After these tense general elections, two much wider questions arise:
– Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Having been elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who will choose the government and president?
Whatever it is, in parliamentary or presidential elections, power will prevail.
That&#39;s tradition.
&quot;Russians have retained the homo sovieticus mentality, they are not masters of their destiny,&quot; says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back even further: civil society developed very slowly in this country, which became Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin returned to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror but by a certain economic prosperity, writes Carnegie&#39;s Maria Lipman -Foundation, endowment.
Today, Russians are &quot;voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility&quot; they briefly displayed after the collapse of the USSR.
&quot;Why think about it?&quot;
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional chairmen) head the local electoral lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms coming out of the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In that sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: “Why think twice?
The ones in power are not so bad, why replace them?”
A heavy keepsake
After being kept confidential for more than 60 years, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents in the archive, which are housed over a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a &quot;humanitarian&quot; intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. when asked by a former victim or his Relatives.
In May 2006, the eleven states charged with administering them - including Germany, France, Israel and the USA - agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
sensitive information
The historians&#39; access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, &quot;above all on the deportation of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced labourers,&quot; explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR) are managed.
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of some deportation victims.
The concentration camp inmate lists, or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo, were collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labor, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, so that they could to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
However, part of the scientific community shows only limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
&quot;One should not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents,&quot; declared Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India&#39;s main trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission last April to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India&#39;s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to European Commission figures, India is only the EU&#39;s ninth trading partner.
&quot;A free trade pact will benefit the two economies enormously&quot; and &quot;India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans,&quot; confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange &quot;€47 billion worth of goods&quot; and &quot;€10 billion worth of services&quot; annually, Daniéle Smadja, chair of the European Commission&#39;s delegation in New Delhi, had declared this week, regretting that mutual trade &quot;has not yet exhausted its potential&quot;. The EU and India will hold their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi on Friday, which will be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concerns and offers £10bn for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about containing the current recurring worries about credit conditions and announced a £10 billion offer with a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with an unusual maturity.
&quot;To allay fears that financial market conditions will be particularly harsh by the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organize their liquidity positions during this time, the Bank has Intends to offer a significant portion of their savings during the maintenance phase beginning December 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks,” it said in a statement.
The bank goes on to explain that this will bring £10 billion (€14 billion) into circulation at 12.15 GMT on December 6th, at the base tax rate and only until January 10th.
This appears to be the first time the BoE has circulated five weeks of liquidity in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it “stands ready to take further action to maintain the” day-to-day “interest rates” on interbank loans at its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank interest rate stood at 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18th.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, funds circulated by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that have discouraged banks from drawing them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to subscribe for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous interest rates and with more secure discretion
The UMP and NC refuse to review the PS&#39;s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Center groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, amounting to a rejection of the text.
The text, created in the context of a socialist &quot;niche&quot; (meeting initiated by a parliamentary group), listed about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, most of them 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP flottante, to a transport check or to limit the rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against considering the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to sometimes heated exchanges between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s TV report on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will present all of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the rectification of finances, examined by the Assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding C3 Presents creating a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer is announcing the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in association with British producer Melvin Benn&#39;s Festival Republic.
&quot;It is an honor for our company to work with someone who, nothing more and nothing less, has served as a role model for the contemporary festival movement in America,&quot; C3&#39;s Charlie Jones shared on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer camping destination.
The festival will probably take place from the 8th to the 10th. August on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world&#39;s most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took charge of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then in 2006 Festival Republic created Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also taken care of the production, the licensing concessions and the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3&#39;s Charlie Jones, who describes Glastonbury as the &quot;most inspirational event&quot; he&#39;s ever been to, says his company and Melvin Benn&#39;s are working side by side to bring a European-style festival event to the area.
“We&#39;ve chosen Philadelphia as our market and are eagerly working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Regrettably, we have become bogged down in political debates regarding the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
&quot;Fortunately we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary location that will ultimately benefit the community.&quot;
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival back to life in Grand Park Chicago after making its mark in the festival world in 2002 alongside the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenue in 2007, respectively.
These two festivals take place in urban settings.
&quot;Melvin Benn&#39;s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more in the urban green space,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
&quot;The aim is, in one way or another, to fuse these two concepts together to give the impression of a rural festival in the European way and an urban one in the American way at the same time.&quot;
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
&quot;The Vineland community, including the mayor, is happy to shoulder the burden of this event,&quot; said Charlie Jones.
The latter declined to divulge the terms of the agreement, but confirmed &quot;that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life.&quot;
Charlie Jones says the festival&#39;s capacity is &quot;very large,&quot; roughly equivalent to the 80,000 people at Tennessee&#39;s Bonnaroo Music Festival.
He says the invitations have been sent out to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they went to print.
&quot;Vineland will feature tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all types of audiences,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
His partners on C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal when none other than the Terminator opposes it.
These attempts at baiting are part of the delegate&#39;s duties.
A politically &quot;sensitive mandate&quot; because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces &quot;Runaway Productions&quot;.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the &quot;governor&quot;?
&quot;You have to be careful because it&#39;s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer what you think are the best,&quot; he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the local cinema has top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
All the West Coast festivals, whether it&#39;s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about showcasing Quebec films, judging them and making sure the producers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the billboard in Santa Monica and will be screened at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Also this month, Quebec presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market headed for an end-of-year rally? Expert disagreement over US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the upcoming end-of-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that “statistically speaking, the month of December in the stock market usually coincides with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make short-term forecasts based solely on statistics. Especially not when tensions that are to be taken seriously determine current market events
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that &quot;the stock price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. Due to the lack of secure equity funds, they mainly invest in bond funds, which are severely affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will show a more lateral price trend, influenced by market fluctuations, “mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US Federal Reserve interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increased crude oil price and the risk of rising inflation rates.”
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an imminent market rally.
&quot;The chances are not very good,&quot; assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its high of 15,945.7 points on November 8th.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could close the year successfully at almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and the traditional pension fund injection that takes place every year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could turn out a little differently; mainly due to the end-of-year rally, which took place in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the bridge day to Constitution Day.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect the market tendencies.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, the assessments of the market situation to date are at an almost technical level, which could mean that “a deviation from the index values could soon become apparent, the extent of which would depend on the consequences of the US - Mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of values that should drive the Ibex to new heights.
Intermoney&#39;s Solana insists that &quot;this year is the turn of the big values.&quot;
The expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies among the value winners, “since the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given point in time.”
Meanwhile, Bank Inversis&#39; Federico Olucha assures that the gains will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally does happen, real estate companies will benefit.
&quot;ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,&quot; said the expert.
With regard to the increased consumer behavior during the Christmas period, periodic consumption will determine market activity in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December saw falling prices in only two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-of-year rally to date.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 gained 28.17 percentage points, December showed a gain of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and also show a year-end rally remains to be seen.
Popular will have its 200 banks open 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the economically strongest regions of Spain.
These branches represent a major milestone for the institute, which operates under the Popular Max brand name.
But also for the rest of the Spanish banks, since Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 8:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The bank&#39;s ongoing negotiations with the unions appear to be aimed at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not to customers.
Whether more banks will join the new initiative, which aligns with business hours, will depend on Popular Bank&#39;s experience.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can attract customers from independent, small and medium-sized companies who are willing to shop, but also from large department stores.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the course of the next 18 months, as the opening hours are not new, but changed.
To do this, the bank will transform the premises of those branches that are already located in business zones, adapting them to the individual customer profile of the different zones at the same time.
The extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any major investments, but is accompanied by an increase in hiring, since a branch now needs eight or nine employees instead of six.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for the SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches on Bravo Murillo, O&#39;Donell and Gran Vía streets have been chosen for what appears to be a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approximately 2500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the Mundocredit name. These specialize in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and public holidays.
These PopularMax branches will not use the BBVA model as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We don&#39;t want to compete with our customers,” explains Rivero.
They have reached a tentative agreement with Telefonica to sell mobile phones with the help of outside bank staff.
Private Spanish broadcaster Telecinco has doubled its stock market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
&quot;We made it.&quot;
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock market. The channel he managed had increased its value by twice that of its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: “That&#39;s exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses,” he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, &quot;they haven&#39;t sunk too low.&quot;
Telecinco ended the day up 2.54% yesterday.
This gain cuts his losses so far this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg data, the goodwill now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the majority of the capital (52%) and Vocento owning only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and is down 40.5% since January, halving its market value at 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communication companies, on the other hand, is increasing; 3,571 million for Sogecable, 2,518.53 million for Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) and 1,779 million for Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that &quot;they are two similar companies&quot;, according to Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level still seems uncertain.
Telecinco announced a week ago that it intends to become the first TV station with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising this year. This was assured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group&#39;s advertising company.
If implemented, the channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of trading (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business increased by only 0.7% (630.4 million). could have.
The analysts see the main factor for Telecinco&#39;s comparatively better stock market development in the high payout ratio that the company has been able to show up to now: In 2006, the company managed by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100 percent dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol&#39;s shares, with Mediaset as parent company, although it is too early for an official announcement.
“We are committed to the official compromise of paying out at least 50% of the shares, even though we have always stated significantly more.
I hope that this year we can satisfy our shareholders, whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of Endemol&#39;s shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing certain downward trend.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit estimate at Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the consequence of the cut in the projected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also lowered Antena 3&#39;s expected profit calculation for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends buying both stocks.
2.
Caja Madrid: attributes Telecinco (buy) to a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) as a result of the “multiple incentives” and the prospering market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends lowering expectations in both cases given the &quot;similar threats&quot; (saturated market and worsening economic climate).
Congress approves MIFID policy, which came into effect on November 1st.
In parallel with the parliamentary elaboration, which ended today with the Senate Congress decision on the amendments/amendments related to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of extending the entry into force of both regulations by the end of May allow year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of the Congress and Senate deputies, who, in their negotiations and votes, pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation, which ensures the security of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities, in order to achieve a generally efficient to guarantee market activity.
In addition to modernizing the financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Securities Services Ordinance, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various control authorities in the European Union.
The new directive makes it possible to offer financial advice both to specialized companies and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies that merge with investment and brokerage companies of securities.
Moreover, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, adding to the regulated circulating markets multilateral systems of securities trading and systems for the internationalization of trading orders, which would eventually compete with current economic players.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the main features of their company profile, the exposure and forms of risk management on the market and to register all the projects carried out, thus facilitating the CNMV&#39;s task of control.
The Congressional Economic Commission subsequently envisaged other changes, with the US mortgage and banking crisis confirming that the titled debt should now be considered a &quot;complex&quot; financial instrument due to its high level of risk to the investor. (US Mortgage Crisis)
In addition, use was made of the entry into force of the directive to legally limit the work areas of qualified economists; 30 years after the 1977 decree limiting the work areas reserved for economists was issued.
For its part, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of commercial mediator, who works on behalf of a third party, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services of commercializing products and client acquisition simultaneously to several investment companies.
The harmonized index of consumer prices (CPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator, which Eurostat uses to assess the inflation rate within the European Union, provides the average price development that took place in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of US products by publishing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared ahead of time using the same approach as for the harmonized index of consumer prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish statistical office (INE) warned that the prematurely determined indicator only serves as a guide and therefore does not have to agree with the final result, which will be announced next December 14th.
“The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level”
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, November&#39;s rise in CPI was a &quot;temporary development&quot;; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a &quot;relatively high&quot; level in the coming months.
Still, in the halls of the Congress building, Solbes noted that &quot;even if the current number isn&#39;t good,&quot; Spain&#39;s inflation differential with other members of the monetary union has &quot;more or less&quot; stayed the same in recent years.
He also explained that November &quot;had fewer surprises&quot; than the previous month, when the government was not expecting such a large increase.
&quot;We expected a value of around 4%,&quot; announced the Economy and Finance Minister with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock&#39;s assets have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the Bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year to deal with just £12,000m.
At that point the bank&#39;s assets were a record £25,000m, a figure which has fallen considerably in two and a half months as customers lost confidence and despite the government&#39;s 100% guarantee that the money would be safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decrease.
Virgin, which would continue to operate the group under the Virgin Money brand after the takeover, will need to bring in around a quarter of the UK banks&#39; income, which will be made up of the next three years&#39; investments there, to raise that £18 billion acquire what is still needed to reach their goal of 30 billion.
Headed by multi-millionaire Richard Branson, known for his flashy advertising campaigns in the UK, the group intends to pour £50,000m a year into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin group, which has three other companies, as its preferred bidder to bail it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on alleged suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
Spanish police this morning arrested the current mayor of the Murcia township of Totano (Partido Popular), on strong suspicion of involvement in urban corruption uncovered this week.
One of the secretaries of the town council and the chief of the town police were also arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current MP for the Popular Party and then head of Totana&#39;s municipal council, and could be the original mastermind behind the plot, according to radio station Cadena SER.
Officers continue to search the municipality&#39;s and Department of Urban Planning&#39;s business records and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption case discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the &quot;popular&quot; and consequently privileged deputy Juan Morales was arrested while leaving his client&#39;s residence on the basis of important incriminating documents allegedly linked to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged contract payments Morales made to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban development contract in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE&#39;s candidacy in Toledo and, if elected, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer made by the Socialist President and Secretary General, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will head the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, if the Socialists win the election, will become President of the Congress.
This is what José Blanco, organizational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party&#39;s headquarters today.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because in politics &quot;it is important to be able to count on the best&quot; and Bono &quot;is among the best&quot;.
Moreover, should the Socialists win the forthcoming elections, the La Mancha-born politician would “apparently” stand as a candidate for the party&#39;s Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President. On November 15, he announced that he would no longer stand in the next general elections, that he would end his career in public politics and instead work for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the district president has continuously pushed for his return to politics.
He also pointed out that, as with the nomination of the vice president for economy, the party does not want to hide from citizens who would take over the post of congress president in the event of a victory, calling this an &quot;act of transparency&quot;.
If he does take office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a &quot;house of respect and not of insult or shouting&quot; so that it &quot;appears more and more like the citizens.&quot;
“Unfortunately one gets the impression from time to time that the only place in Madrid where one cannot talk calmly and calmly is at the Congress; the District President was once interrupted up to 26 times in the Senate.”
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and &quot;his good work&quot; and indicated that he did not want to appear to have already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call it &quot;arrogance&quot;.
climate propaganda
As the climate debate relentlessly critiques both climate change skeptics and those who prioritize a social and political debate around it, the movement as a whole needs to show strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, even proposing to sign a “new contract with the planet”.
This proposal, however, leaves him with a difficult time explaining his government&#39;s action or inaction, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain being one of the countries in the EU that has least met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the non-compliance, which sectors are responsible for this and why has his government, which proposed the “deal with the planet”, not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish people directly the measures he intends to take to combat climate change.
Which companies will be affected, which behavior of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures have to be implemented and which economic consequences will result.
More specifically, who must sacrifice themselves and will pay to save the planet.
However, there have been and will be no such explanations in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can actually be used to combat climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to corporate and citizen accounts.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous to Zapatero in terms of electoral strategy that he felt compelled to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty slogans without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise campaign-fit politician doesn&#39;t have to talk, accuse, or demand, but instead pursues the demanding expense of embellishing the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not stipulate that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in the future or that we can only refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the &quot;popular&quot; politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor&#39;s office and a hotel manager were taken into custody on suspicion of urban planning violations, investigators said today.
The councilor was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office, where he is to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who are also with the municipal administration and the municipal works management &quot;Suelo Industrial y Vivienda&quot;. had arrived.
The three arrests are linked to manhunts in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, which revealed that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land was to be redeveloped for urban projects led by Galician construction company Nuaria. This was supposed to build 4,000 apartments on the property after the local administration gave them illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people were not arrested directly, but were subjected to preliminary investigations, which are being initiated and carried out by Totona&#39;s first court.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales is also under investigation.
His ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, are also suspects.
The president and owner of the group “Nuaria”, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel NA from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of “Suelo de Inmonuar” Pablo José MG, whose company as a sub-group acted by &quot;Nuaria&quot; and is said to have received the bribe.
The investigations are being carried out by the Municipal Office against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven other searches, most of them in companies directly related to those in Madrid, Vigo , Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming business, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The “Nuaria” group was commissioned to construct the largest residential complex in the municipality belonging to Murcia; this should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana that needed to be redeveloped. The aim was to realize a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which manages the car parks of Coruña Street, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector, and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

If you&#39;re ok with that, we&#39;ll move away from the phrase &quot;Book of the Month&quot; and instead try to invent a different-named award designation with equivalent powers.

Of course you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is at the top of the PISA study, by the way), which responds to the note published in the same newspaper on November 18; coincidentally on the day the issue contained the criticism of Blackburn&#39;s book.
“After the tragedy of the Jokela school, the content of the philosophy subject has become a topic of public debate.
A high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his news reports is responsible for the gruesome murders.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that Plato&#39;s teachings should be included in the lower-level syllabuses for philosophy at high schools cancel.

A colleague provides information about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be breaking the law, punishable by six months imprisonment.
On the other hand, if you rob a music store with a value of less than 400 euros, this is only considered a simple offense (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the shop up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still less than a download (Article 244.1).
D. Participating in a brawl is less serious than participating in a music file exchange.
Engaging in a rebellious struggle carries a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while sharing data carries a prison sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Under Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyrighted film without authorization from the copyright holder is subject to a higher penalty than distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, someone has raised their demands quite a bit.

My GP hands me one of his long, weird research articles entitled, &quot;Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others are getting more of it.&quot;
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was conducted using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life&amp;Brain, &quot;activation was strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his teammate, on the other hand, failed.&quot;
The researchers were able to see that the brain activity was always very moderate when both participants answered correctly and therefore received the same salary; but if one of them got double that, there was also more brain activity.”
I&#39;m not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to arrive at such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly searching for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is in the Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Criminal Court of the Former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her post with mixed feelings, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely ex-General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo- Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on the list that Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach used as a template for the title of his documentary film “La Liste de Carla” (2006, not yet released in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, follows the Swiss public prosecutor from Belgrade to New York as they plan to track down the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten their nets.
Which insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers possible damage caused by the driver, entails a high cost, the amount of which in turn depends on various factors, including age, gender, when the driver&#39;s license was issued, marital status, the type of car to be insured and how it is used, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding compensation sum in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance, which is determined by a number of factors, including age, gender, date of issue of driver&#39;s license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or how it is used.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher premium payments are due if there is a higher risk of an accident.
As a result, both the over-25s and women pay less because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same also applies to married people, since, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to have fewer accidents than single people.
The utility attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies have to take a number of points into account.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point we list the most important points that you should consider when choosing an insurance policy, so that you can make a choice that is not only performance-based but also price-based.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance, such as little driving experience and the &quot;young&quot; driver&#39;s license.
Even if comprehensive insurance would be best for ideal insurance coverage, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Prudent drivers can choose Collision Damage Waiver with Excess, covering the benefits of Collision Damage Waiver but at a lower price.
This type of contract means that the customer has to pay part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
“The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the lower the sum to be paid,” explains Luis Noguera, main representative for Spain at First Europa, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures customers against external accidental damage, but not against damage caused to their own car.
Also, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here&#39;s some advice.
If you&#39;re under 25, it&#39;s up to you to reduce insurance costs; this will increase your credit by trying to drive carefully and avoiding accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate with the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariff.
“The amount of credits and penalties depend on the company and its income.
If the company has had a profitable year, it can afford to increase the bonus payments,” explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Therefore, it makes the most sense to opt for fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
&quot;Usually, youngsters cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving&quot;, explains the Spanish director of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice, after the &quot;Beginner&#39;s Fear&quot; is discarded.
Nevertheless, for a married customer who has no children, it is more advisable to take out comprehensive insurance; Of course, only if the financial situation of the person in question allows it.
Insurers consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and their premium payments are correspondingly low.
In this case, comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In the event that you have received a high credit, we recommend extended insurance, which only begins in the third year of the vehicle.
&quot;They drive more relaxed overall and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to charge higher premiums,&quot; notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it makes sense to take out fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible (for an amount of around 150 euros), or an extended insurance policy that only kicks in when the credit is sufficiently high.
Finally, it must be said that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damage, but also because it involves high costs that require a thorough selection to be made that suits our personal situation .
Celtic Glasgow are hoping for a point for the round of 16 in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will battle it out in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they lack to reach their respective goals before the Champions League preliminary round is completed. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while the Scots need it to determine their participation.
The Italian side already have five points and have confirmed their place in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic on nine need another to ensure FC Shakhtar on six points defeat Befica Lisbon not caught with four points.
The two Group D games will take place a week before the end of Round 6 as Milan face the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they will be vying for a place in the final for the first time in the semi-finals on the 13th takes place on the 16th.
So this group will finish before anyone else and the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the result everyone is expecting, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home as Keltik Glasgow knows that if they win they will finish first in their group and thus have a better starting position in the round of 16.
Even if Shakhtar FC suffer a defeat, Gordon Strachan&#39;s side could be satisfied with a defeat to qualify. However, he shouldn&#39;t put too much faith in such circumstances, because if there is a nine-point tie, the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but won the second game (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to spoil the evening for the Scots. They, in turn, are hoping to reach the last 16 of the revamped Champions League for the second year in a row after beating out the previous season in exactly the same round thanks to an injury-time goal from Kaka (1-0) and a 0-0 draw in the first leg were defeated.
While FC Shakhtar wait for the &#39;Rossoneri&#39; to win, the side will have to focus on their own game as both reaching the Round of 16 and UEFA membership depend on their victory and a defeat by Celtic Glasgow.
Despite being bottom of the table and without the prospect of continuing to play in Europe&#39;s biggest league, Benfica could, if they win, take third place and join UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour since the band broke up in 2000 in front of a crowd of 20,000 in Vancouver, Canada.
&#39;Posh Spice&#39; (Victoria Beckham), &#39;Scary Spice&#39; (Melanie Brown), &#39;Baby Spice&#39; (Emma Bunton), &#39;Sporty Spice&#39; (Melanie Chisholm) y &#39;Ginger Spice&#39; (Geri Halliwell) declared just before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the atmosphere in the reunited band was &quot;excellent&quot;.
Around 20,000 people were able to see the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video about the history of the band, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunion and world tour coincide with the release of a new album, which includes their greatest hits and two other new songs, “Headlines” and “Voodoo”, to be released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold armbands on stage, given to them earlier by &quot;Posh Spice&#39;s&quot; husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the crowds of fans in the audience who made the GM Palace glow, despite the fact that his wife Victoria&#39;s nerves had forbidden him in the previous days.
In preparation for the show, Victoria Beckham revealed that the British star &quot;hasn&#39;t even set eyes on our wardrobe so I&#39;m excited to see what he thinks of the performance.&quot;
&quot;Sporty Spice&quot;, whose departure from the group in 1998 &quot;due to internal disagreements&quot; led to the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed her nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
&quot;I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And so I thought, actually why not; so I&#39;m glad I made that decision,&quot; Chisholm said of the band&#39;s split, which prompted it nine years ago.
The singer also revealed that &quot;the arguments have been settled and everyone is very fond of each other now.&quot;
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines plane, according to CTV.
Arriving at the airport, the band was greeted by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will next perform in California, in San Jose (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will take the stage on December 23rd.
New fears over gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is brewing between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk that Russian fuel exports to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of Russia&#39;s natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are routed through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kyiv has warned that if Moscow increases the price it pays for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest row between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia&#39;s state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be billed more as the company has agreed to pay up to 50% extra for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom&#39;s imports.
&quot;It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks,&quot; Ukraine&#39;s Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
&quot;Changing natural gas prices should no doubt be coupled with our arguments about the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.&quot;
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, driving up prices drastically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union&#39;s supply.
Russia has the world&#39;s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS &#39;must control foreign workers&#39;
The Scottish National Health Service needs to improve checks on criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the enforcement body. outside of
Chief Financial Controller Robert Black&#39;s recommendation came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was implicated in the Glasgow Airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish National Health Service did not have a clear idea of how many expatriate staff it has.
But his report indicated that other important checks were correctly performed on a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated staff recruited from outside the European Economic Area countries in the wake of the Glasgow Airport attack.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an SUV was driven through the main airport terminal doors.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video feed at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bombing in Britain.
The National Health Service is expected to carry out pre-employment checks on foreign staff to ensure they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although public health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The chief examiner&#39;s report now says, among other recommendations, that the board should take up criminal record guidelines, which help employers with checks in different countries.
&quot;Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely performed.&quot; stated the report.
Black said Scottish Health Authorities are closely following their pre-employment screening guidelines, but added: &quot;Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of expatriate health workers is available To be available.&quot;
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was &quot;extremely unlikely&quot; that pre-employment research of potential NHS staff would identify people who could carry out future terrorist attacks.
&quot;The report states that current NHS Scotland pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will bring,&quot; he said.
Scottish Health Authorities say they currently have 1,161 expatriate staff, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the Financial Controller warned that the number is likely higher, also because boards have had trouble identifying those employees who are on indefinite furlough.
The inquiry also found that established control procedures had largely been followed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
This includes passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines on pre-employment checks for migrant staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;It was important to me to do this work in light of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.&quot;
She added that the Scottish Government, in liaison with the health authorities, would take the report&#39;s recommendations into account and ensure that best practice is reflected in updated guidance on pre-employment screening of all staff - including those from abroad - scheduled for release next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biopic about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
Awards were also presented to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast to play Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench won Best Actress for the thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety award for bringing British film to the world&#39;s attention.
The awards were presented at a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti&#39;s rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at age 23.
The black-and-white film - which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order on its soundtrack - was made for just £3million.
Nonetheless, he brought Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and best directorial debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple&#39;s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer took home Best Documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg&#39;s London-based thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, picked up the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, which was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
&quot;It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney that opened doors for people like me,&quot; he said.
&quot;I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He&#39;s my type of guy, a great actor of his time, I&#39;m really honored.&quot;
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a panel that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for their involvement in cells planning an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as clerics and security forces.
State television of the world&#39;s largest oil exporter said one of the cells planned to smuggle in missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has deployed a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect facilities following a botched al Qaeda attack on the world&#39;s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, citing a Home Secretary statement, says 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell headed by a &quot;missile expert&quot; who entered the country illegally.
He reports that the militants planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of those arrested planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis heading into Iraq to join forces with al Qaeda militias bent on fighting allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government used by hard-liners among the Sunni Saudis as is considered heretical.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be colluding with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
&quot;This has been a very major effort by the security forces over the past...five months,&quot; an Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
The arrests also involved a &quot;media cell&quot; of 16 from Medina aimed at promoting &quot;takfiri thinking&quot; - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims, who are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could offer a glimpse of Earth&#39;s future
Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft shows that the planet resembles an averted twin of Earth even more than previously realized.
Venus is Earth&#39;s closest planetary neighbor.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and have similar planetary orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have had conditions very similar to Earth&#39;s and might even have been habitable, scientists now believe.
But because of the unchecked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation, and a slower rotation rate, Venus took a very different evolutionary trajectory.
Today, the planet is deprived of water, has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead, and is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
Findings from the European Space Agency&#39;s Venus Express spacecraft, which surveyed the planet for a year, offer a sobering look at how Earth might evolve in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: &quot;It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth when the planets are otherwise quite similar. &quot;
&quot;Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario where Venus started like Earth billions of years ago, possibly with a habitable environment.&quot;
&quot;Enriched uranium&quot; confiscated by police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the footage is being examined.
He did not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he didn&#39;t think it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican nominee for the presidency ultimately agreed to face a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters videotape and submit questions to send to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman polling Democrats about global warming in the other party&#39;s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time accurately reflected the state of the Republican Party heading into next year&#39;s elections.
It is not known exactly how the producers at CNN, who helped support the debate, chose YouTube clips to be shown to the prospective candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single issue, immigration took center stage.
The issue is one of the most hard-hitting issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The network noticed spikes of agreement as the candidates spoke harshly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the national trailblazer, and Romney, who&#39;s pushed ahead in the pivotal polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shrug off the reputation that he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two had a particularly heated argument when questioners asked whether either candidate would support an &quot;amnesty&quot; (which would give illegals regular status and the opportunity for citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to dig deeper on the issue.
Neither man stands a serious chance of being nominated, but both remain in the running, perhaps because they hit the immigration drum earlier and harder than others.
In the area of immigration, at least, the candidates broadly share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance of illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, is helping Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate clearly became problematic when other issues were brought up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani taking the position that while the Bible was his book of choice, he might not literally believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all odds, in first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed about whether Jesus would endorse them, he laughed and said Jesus was too intelligent to run for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee&#39;s rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul&#39;s recent fundraising successes and his thunderous applause in Wednesday&#39;s debate.
These two have sprung up out of nowhere because the party&#39;s two wings have yet to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one candidate united the party from the start and convincingly with a victorious message of America&#39;s greatness and a nod to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labor Party Pains
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall into; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this one isn&#39;t particularly raunchy.
No titles seem to have been sold, no politician&#39;s Parisian hotel bills paid, no extramarital toes sucked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman hid donations to Britain&#39;s ruling Labor Party of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under other people&#39;s names, and that the party failed to report it, is something without which the embattled Gordon Brown would have gotten along well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister evaded calls for an election, stupidly insulting the intelligentsia of Britain by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced that decision, there was hope that he could provide a robust, efficient government would.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly astute Liberal Democrat branch chairman, put it, the once-dreaded Brown has evolved from Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, exposed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Ill-considered proposals to change tax laws have turned business groups against the government.
The tax authorities&#39; loss of personal data from 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
A trio of retired generals launched a riot in the House of Lords to protest cuts in military spending: being Minister of the Armed Forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labor&#39;s general secretary (and its former head of compliance) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown is irrevocably heading for the exit.
Yet governments can reach a tipping point after which they find it impossible to govern.
People don&#39;t like or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it&#39;s clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn&#39;t even have to be around long, that respite is over: public services begin to leak; the cabinet ministers begin to chatter; the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown&#39;s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would like to disown Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if he wasn&#39;t directly involved in Blair&#39;s misadventures - as with the long &quot;money for titles&quot; investigation into political party funding - voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown&#39;s situation isn&#39;t quite as bad as it looks
The transgressions are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one has died or been swindled outright.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown&#39;s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss over political donations is a good example.
The garboesque Abrahams, who compares his donations to his charitable offerings, says he doesn&#39;t want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but it wasn&#39;t up to him to decide.
The laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear, and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those running the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham&#39;s agreement but not that it&#39;s illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; as did Jon Mendlesohn, Labour&#39;s chief financial collector, who was told about the odd donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the work.
He was quick to condemn his party&#39;s violation of the law, but he watered down that resolve by reaching for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry into the issue - led to top it all off by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the &quot;lessons to be learned&quot; are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it&#39;s a matter for the police.
That being said, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, like finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with sweeping reform of political party funding.
That would require Labor hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion polls; he has two years to win voters back; and the only way he can achieve victory is through unimpeachable integrity and solid competence.
card sharks
Is the Credit Crisis Contagious to America&#39;s Credit Card Market?
When there&#39;s blood in the water, it&#39;s only natural for dorsal fins to whirl around excitedly.
Now that America&#39;s real estate market is ailing, the predators are targeting the country&#39;s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if contagion from underfunded lending spreads to other forms of consumer lending.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both charge-offs and delinquency rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are each uncollectible or more than 30 days late.
HSBC announced last month that it had withdrawn a $1.4 billion fee from its US consumer finance operations, in part because of weakness in credit card users.
Still, it&#39;s too early to panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in US personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large portion of credit card losses; the number of filings (and thus late fees) would increase again whether the general conditions for borrowers worsen or not.
The industry is also reporting solid payment rates, showing how much of their debt consumers are paying off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, reckons that 2007 output volumes will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers are more likely to take on credit card debt now that home equity loans dry up.
However, card issuers look at cash flow rather than capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower&#39;s creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial to card issuers.
Consumers&#39; incentives to continue making mortgage payments decrease when the property is worth less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond to the more stormy conditions much more quickly and flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
That should, in theory, reduce the risk of a quick revaluation of assets.
&quot;We&#39;re not going to wake up one day and completely reevaluate the loans,&quot; said Gary Perlin, Capital One&#39;s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden credit card market shortage is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are far more real.
As lower home prices and credit contraction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future.
Keep an eye out for those shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to face trial for their role in the fraudulent scheme involving former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow changed their pleas to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded not guilty to seven counts of telecom fraud for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The trial was scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before US District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one count of telecom fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, came to prominence in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron&#39;s collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 alerted Fastow to the fact that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron&#39;s demise.
The prosecution against the bankers -- dubbed the &quot;NatWest Three&quot; -- alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to plot a fraudulent scheme involving Fastow and his former top adviser, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless Enron fraud schemes that helped send the company into bankruptcy.
In early 2002, the bank valued their stake in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew it was in fact of significant value.
A company under Kopper&#39;s control acquired the bank&#39;s interest in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the venture.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its interest in the subsidiary.
But actually the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others scooped about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron&#39;s bankruptcy.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in the Louisiana Federal Penitentiary.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence at a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was at large on $1 million bail, requiring them to reside in the United States awaiting trial.
Enron, once the nation&#39;s seventh-largest company, crumbled into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer mask billions in debt or make ailing operations look profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay&#39;s convictions on conspiracy, fraud and other charges were vacated after he died of heart disease last year.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that&#39;s small change for some of the rich Russians.
&quot;It seats up to 18 passengers,&quot; said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
&quot;But none of you are asking for that many seats because it&#39;s for a private family or a corporate president.&quot;
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires&#39; Show, a four-day orgy of display consumption held at a convoluted exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly-moneyed Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-plated car grilles worthy of 50 cents.
Firer cautiously sighted a shiny orange Porsche at the nearest booth.
&quot;It&#39;s a nice car, but it&#39;s pocket change compared to ours,&quot; he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.&quot;
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as awash with money as Dallas was in its heyday.
&quot;We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans got gargantuan wealth and flocked to Europe, where they were seen as materialistic,&quot; said Marshall Goldman, a researcher at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian high-flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world&#39;s most visible lavish spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands seek their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a luxury industry conference drew Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion according to Forbes&#39; list of the richest people.
Additionally, 103,000 Russian millionaires are second-class, collectively worth $670 billion, according to a study on personal wealth development in the former Soviet Union written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative for David Morris, a London jeweler.
She attended the show for the first time alongside the brand&#39;s Russian retailer, Soho Jewelry Group.
&quot;The women are all well groomed and the men are all worth a fortune.&quot;
As they parade through the halls in evening dress on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
&quot;I&#39;ve been looking at the cars and I&#39;m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,&quot; said Ms Yumatova, who donned the designer clothes she wore like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the nouveau riche, the type of brand-conscious Russian shopper who would be willing to sit in traffic for several hours to visit a draughty warehouse that unabashedly stocks Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, bespoke pool tables , Apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears juxtaposed.
The public could purchase tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
&quot;Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,&quot; said Mr Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized replica of a Rembrandt picture made of hand-painted blue tesserae.
&quot;Of course, Russians are more interested in klimper-klimper.&quot;
In fact, traders here say that old-money Russians (10-15 years is old by Russian standards) have already moved from flamboyant logos to the kind of down-to-earth, limited-run brands that wouldn&#39;t market themselves at a trade show .
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, crowded through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds here, said he sold two $70,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton with gold thread sewn into them.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
As of Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of LA Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three Rolls-Royce Phantom grilles, which resemble linked chain bracelets, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner with spokes he had coated with colored Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
&quot;The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather bikes or a cubic zirconium picture of his wife&#39;s face is not necessarily going to ride those bikes,&quot; Mr Karapetian said.
&quot;He&#39;ll keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage.&quot;
Though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase &quot;Russian millionaires&quot; doesn&#39;t convey much exclusivity right now given the rise in property prices here.
&quot;If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you&#39;re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are more of them than you think.&quot;
Those who weren&#39;t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red British-style telephone booths stuffed with piles of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing director, said his staff printed out 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaires&#39; Fair.
Passers-by stopped to toss the piles of cash, have friends snap cellphone photos as they sit back amid the spare wealth, or simply pocket a few million.
&quot;You see, in Moscow anyone can feel like a millionaire,&quot; said Mr. Karryev.
Botched operation suspected in death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance pull up on white Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, a police car was there.
And then there was another.
&quot;Then I saw the medical examiner&#39;s van coming up,&quot; Livingston, a supervisor at the restaurant, said Wednesday.
&quot;That was the point when I knew someone had died.&quot;
Authorities learned the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not identified, who worked at the home at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms Arroyo&#39;s death and are hopeful that toxicology studies, the results of which may not be available for weeks, will help solve a mysterious death that has sent grief through top Newark Police Department leaders.
Ms Arroyo had been an assistant to the Police Commissioner, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006 and her voice was well known to many in the department.
&quot;She was loyal, hard-working and persistent,&quot; Mr McCarthy said of Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
&quot;She was my pit bull.
She protected me.&quot;
McCarthy said that Ms Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she is survived by two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators are trying to determine if Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
&quot;That&#39;s one of the possibilities,&quot; Ms. Walsh said.
&quot;It&#39;s an ongoing investigation.&quot;
Authorities said they arrived at the home around 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the home, who is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh declined to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
No one answered the door to Ms Castro&#39;s home on Wednesday, where a wilted rosebush stands in the scant front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue keg labeled &quot;Ethyl Vanillin&quot; - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot by a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture of his new city.
&quot;She said, &#39;You have to pay attention to this or that,&#39;&quot; he said.
&quot;She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrasing.&quot;
Hopes that the central bank will cut interest rates lead to a rise in world stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets by cutting interest rates further were bolstered by dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve Vice Chairman.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, No. 2 for Central Bank Governor Ben Bernanke, said policymakers must be &quot;flexible and pragmatic&quot; in responding to ongoing pressures in financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm troubled markets amid signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil has &quot;partially reversed some of the improvements in market functioning seen in late September and October.&quot;
If the heightened turbulence persists, it would raise the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize credit conditions with fresh capital injections into US markets and possible further rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street in the face of more bad news from the US economy as US home sales hit a new record low in October.
The fallout from the financial turmoil was underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workforce, in a cost-cutting move to offset heavy losses from its losing bets in the US mortgage lending sector .
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-based S&amp;P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to end at 6,306.2, adding more than £39 billion to the value of UK blue chips.
Germany&#39;s Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France&#39;s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Earlier, the reemergence of credit pressures on the markets had been underscored after strong demand at an auction of European Central Bank three-month guarantee funds granted to European commercial banks sold at a whopping 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure mounted on the Bank of England, US Central Bank and European Central Bank to follow suit and inject more funds into the money markets in London as credit tensions eased three-month &quot;Libor&quot; rates for lending between UK banks at June 6 .59 percent rose to its highest since late September, after rising steadily since November 21.
England face decision over Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara testimonies
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who should be No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here on call, at least under that particular title, to help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, is gradually filling up with applications for, if not part-time, national electoral offices.
Whoever doesn&#39;t get sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport undoubtedly is.
It&#39;s never easy to pinpoint exactly what enables one person to reach the top of their profession while another never rises above the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are required which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to step up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may perhaps be asked in another area, such as whether John Edwards or &quot;Tubby&quot; Banerjee, both bright young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the proper class is for a cricketer unless he is given the opportunity to swim or sink.
Of course, numbers have a big impact on decisions, but so do opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain&#39;s eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batter must get regular chances on the order if he is to impress as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, James Anderson, who looks set to play in the first Test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself sane and how the wind cones in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets of 33 runs each to earn a position on that tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and are hoping for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The election could decide both men&#39;s careers, or it might make little difference after all.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every Test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then struggling to consolidate, who made the breakthrough into a significant Test cricketer and the , although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia is perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, following further discussion at today&#39;s Asgiriya Stadium net session, will follow their conservative instincts and gut instincts for Shah&#39;s greater experience of Bopara&#39;s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
Pros for Shah are his scintillating and valuable 88 Test debut innings at Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and just six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and an excellent record against flipped balls.
But Shah hit just ten runs in his two innings in May against the West Indies in the Test at Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the pickers when Vaughan was healthy, secured his position for the next game withdrawing seems to have taken the momentum out of his batting, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex jack-of-all-trades has a shovel full of joie de vivre.
He is unfazed by anything on a cricket ground and his demeanor off the beaten track was summed up when he recently flipped a four-wheel drive vehicle at a show for England sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had been watching from a distance, and say enthusiastically, &quot;You did saw that?&quot;.
Bopara is a much better outfield player, bowling his mid pace with some effect here on the pitches which seems to suit him, hitting with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps that is the real art of selection.
I&#39;m inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn&#39;t mean Shah might not look good after all if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he&#39;s the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have run out and others hoping the city can return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was bustling with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
&quot;I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,&quot; said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
&quot;I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now.&quot;
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,&quot; he said, referring to the Shia militias of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be withdrawn at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to say that a local US-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of their bastion west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who was forced from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, by a hand grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
&quot;Two days ago, some of my friends called me and said they were starting an anti-al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed my support and that of my boys.
That&#39;s why I came back today,&quot; said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop surge and the growth of local &quot;concerned citizen groups&quot; who are armed and working with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and dwindling funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed common suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country&#39;s sectarian death squads.
&quot;We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq,&quot; the Sunni pensioner said.
&quot;I can&#39;t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.&quot;
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shia neighborhoods and vice versa, creating many places where tensions have eased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and conflict.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education does the Saarland suffer from the same deficit as the rest of the country.
&quot;Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a non-Saarlander that we are not French&quot; - this is the self-ironic slogan of the smallest federal state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in Saarland&#39;s education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitor of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
The universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent.
But Saarland also sends an above-average number of children to universities - many of them without a high school diploma.
&quot;In Saarland, people use the vocational training system,&quot; says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people acquire their university entrance qualification at a vocational school, which puts Saarland more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The options for combining professional and academic training are also comparatively well developed.
In relation to the population, dual study programs are the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
&quot;After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms at general schools,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
So that the children can start learning earlier, the last year of daycare is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying.
Only future comparative studies will show whether the performance of the students will improve in the long term.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of high-risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bayern calculate better.
And to the annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - otherwise you could score points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is compulsory at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez had the clocks turned back half an hour in the South American country.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a joke.
According to a new law, Venezuela&#39;s official gazette will set clocks to universal time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American country a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, who is hostile to the United States, justified his decision with the fact that the United States had imposed the division of time zones on the hour on the hour.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) that relations with neighboring Colombia would be severed due to a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
&quot;I can&#39;t do that because of my dignity alone,&quot; said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil-producing country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe&#39;s decision to withdraw Chávez&#39;s mandate to hold talks with Marxist rebels in Colombia over the release of hostages.
Uribe &quot;spit in the face&quot; of Venezuela with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also on everyone&#39;s lips in Spain.
A new mobile phone ringtone is causing a sensation in the country: &quot;Por qué no te callas&quot; (Why don&#39;t you shut up) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken to by Spain&#39;s King Juan Carlos, who was annoyed by the left-wing populist&#39;s constant heckling at the most recent Ibero-American summit and scolded him.
Germans are threatened with a drop in wages in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are threatened with real wage losses this year, according to a forecast.
Experts gave a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could expect less in real terms on their salary accounts than in the previous year.
&quot;This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price hikes in food and energy,&quot; said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper.
Unemployment insurance could also place new burdens on employees.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot; that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was correct and reasonable given the current situation.
However, the SPD politician was quoted as saying that the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again by having to ask the federal government for loans or grants.
On Tuesday it became known that the price explosion for food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is Earth&#39;s infernal twin
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe &quot;Venus Express&quot; has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbulence at the poles, which also occurs on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected lightning on Venus.
Now the European probe &quot;Venus Express&quot; has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shoots from cloud to cloud at a height of around 56 kilometers, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine &quot;Nature&quot;.
According to the famous &quot;primeval soup theory&quot;, lightning gave rise to life on earth: Thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: &quot;If life ever existed there, it must have been in very early history,&quot; explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
&quot;Venus may be Earth&#39;s devil twin, but she is a twin,&quot; Russel said.
The basic question of the ESA mission is why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in terms of mass and size, has developed in such a completely different way.
The launch of &quot;Venus Express&quot; in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since there had been no probe dedicated to exploring this planet since the early 1990s.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several &quot;Nature&quot; articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
&quot;They also show that our neighboring planet has more in common with Earth than initially assumed,&quot; says ESA.
In addition to the well-known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on Earth&#39;s winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
However, it revolves around itself much more slowly: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus hardly resembles Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both, which remained in oceans on Earth but was lost to space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel&#39;s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Koehler is worried about Germany&#39;s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
&quot;We shouldn&#39;t present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,&quot; Koehler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Koehler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
&quot;Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the differences in cultures,&quot; said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, emphasized the Federal President, but defended Merkel against the accusation that she was pursuing a new China policy.
&quot;The chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,&quot; said Koehler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly indicated displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from within the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the &quot;window policy&quot; of the Union in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was received in the Chancellery, there was severe irritation in German-Chinese relations.
The Chinese leadership has not only uninvited German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries, according to SPIEGEL information.
China&#39;s Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
Wen Jiabao reiterated the Chinese position, and China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in an official capacity.
The Dalai Lama&#39;s actions and words showed that he was trying to secede Tibet and the wider Tibetan region, which includes other modern-day provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot the police with shotguns: After the serious youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
&quot;We have to make sure that social explosives don&#39;t build up and explode into violence in our country too.
We have to take it seriously,&quot; he told the Hanover-based &quot;Neue Presse&quot;.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The federal, state and local governments are already working hard to eliminate problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only apply to the integration of migrants.
&quot;From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing the first signs of success.&quot;
However, it is too early to give the all-clear.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same urban planning and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had fought serious street battles with the police in the past few nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the federal government.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned of &quot;imitation effects&quot;.
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background under the age of 25 was &quot;above average&quot;.
Above all, more training places must be provided.
Kolat emphasized: &quot;We have to give the young people a perspective.&quot;
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany &quot;social control takes place more in families&quot; than in France.
In addition, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat warned: &quot;But we still have to be careful.&quot;
You have to &quot;quickly give the young people the opportunity to participate in work and training&quot;.
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was largely quiet.
Hundreds of police were on duty, a helicopter flew over the area with searchlights.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the previous day, a contingent of around 1,000 security forces has been keeping things calm.
Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs that the police would crack down as long as necessary.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The riots spread to Toulouse the following night.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the public prosecutor&#39;s office, the police are not to blame for the death of the young people.
In the kingdom of Angela cloud
The Chancellor&#39;s unrealistic appearance documents that the content of the coalition is at an end - and that nothing more can be expected from her.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her dismal appearance in the general debate in the Bundestag, which was meaningless and lacking in content, one has to say: not here - not in the country that she should finally rule.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is concentrating too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
That&#39;s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn&#39;t want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, she clearly documented how true her accusation was.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an aloof politician who flees into foreign policy and even there remains vague.
Example of climate protection: She praises herself unreservedly for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in this country.
In general, the self-praise - the CDU leader would have refused so much immodesty two years ago.
Now she clings to the phrase that the upswing is reaching people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of praising the world.
But in Angela Wolke&#39;s empire, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for it.
It is significant how often she makes mistakes when it comes to the child allowance.
Merkel needs three attempts to get a reasonably straight sentence out.
She stumbles as if on unfamiliar territory when things get concrete.
Attack department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver a tough exchange of blows - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates discharges already with the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani of having made New York a &quot;place of refuge for illegal immigrants&quot;.
He countered with serious allegations: &quot;I would say his own house was a haven for illegals,&quot; replies Giuliani, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are launching an attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are little more than keywords.
&quot;We let Hitler come to power with this kind of isolationism,&quot; John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the group to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets the riot act from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called &quot;waterboarding,&quot; an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, as torture.
The reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida show that the important issues of the campaign meanwhile go beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are touted and future tax increases rejected, applause erupts in the auditorium.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
&quot;I was wrong then,&quot; Romney explains contritely and apologizes to the base and the television audience for the fact that in 1994 he was still an abortion advocate.
Giuliani, on the other hand, falters when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilian clothes for the first time
Pakistani ruler Musharraf has been sworn in as president a day after resigning as army chief.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan&#39;s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday he handed over his post as army chief to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani, thereby bowing to international pressure, particularly from the United States.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general is now ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a key demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf imposed on November 3rd.
Soon after being sworn in, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thereby fulfilling another demand from the West.
The country&#39;s Supreme Court, which Musharraf occupied with lawyers who favored him after the state of emergency was declared in early November, last week dismissed all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of krautrock return
Germany&#39;s super group of the seventies is making music again: the three band members from Harmonia took up their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
A recording from their heyday &quot;Live 1974&quot; will be released for the revival.
Even then they were much more famous abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three seated gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the middle in a pristine white shirt at the age of 63.
Flanked on the left by Michael Rother, 57 years young and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is hunched over, concentrating at the console.
Everyone contributes noises, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends into a conventional piece of music.
That doesn&#39;t seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is making music again has caused quite a stir among Krautrock lovers.
Although one may reveal here: targeted inquiries revealed that the name buzzed through the collective pop memory, but by no means so lastingly that this band had been sorely missed for 32 years.
But why shouldn&#39;t the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what was misleadingly called Krautrock was always more important in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Prize for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, you could see questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also addressed the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! thanked them, the astonishment knew no bounds.
At concerts, Michael Rother would later sit on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration abroad is one thing.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years and during this time developed a much smaller impact than others later assigned to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out with Kraftwerk and then gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Alter Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as communards who had fled the city.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
Rather in a pointed existence as an artist.
Allegedly, a pennant from the Harmonia Ottenstein singing club and a name for the art were also found in the bulky waste.
Harmonia captured some of it.
The first album was called &quot;Musik von Harmonia&quot; and the following one &quot;De Luxe&quot;.
Because no matter how relaxed and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material hardship.
The gathering of brushwood was not just for self-discovery.
The CD &quot;Live 1974&quot; that has now been released was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record crowd of almost 50 people, as someone believes to remember.
At that time, Rother wanted to push harmonia and practice it occasionally.
An immoral demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother ended up in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums like &quot;Flamende Herzen&quot;.
Cluster was revived in the 80&#39;s and since then has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We have Herbert Grönemeyer to thank for the Griessemer live album.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating krautrock as the very own German contribution to living music.
New! was already dug up like Roedelius&#39; solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is here, the Brit, Altpunk and author of the manual &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot;.
There is also the Love Parade inventor Dr. Moth.
Which outlines the entire range of influences of krautrock on the pop music that followed.
Harmonia fills in the blank of the super group.
Brian Eno&#39;s phrase floats in the hall with the strangest sounds: &quot;The only true music, the future belongs to it.&quot;
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse room.
Projections of further black-and-white photos of tangled wired devices serve to form the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are busy improvising again.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums in order to elicit outrageous tones from the instruments using self-made effect devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technical inventors.
The choir of the house doesn&#39;t change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, there will be coughing and whispering under clouds of sound and, at one point, with emphasis: &quot;Aaaaaaaah!&quot; sung.
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music academies (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here &quot;&#39;68!&quot; calls is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia don&#39;t let that bother them now.
Even the most obvious things are thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can get on your nerves or bring fleeting moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere just isn&#39;t cynical enough
With &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; and &quot;Mörderischer Frieden&quot; two more films deal with the Balkan war.
But both are not convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and banging, or they are too maudlin.
Richard Gere in &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; can&#39;t help either.
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely there, in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere has been found.
We&#39;d lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s because too many nice-as-neglected roles in feel-good movies for women and too many Buddhist-themed press conferences made you unwilling to look.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch &quot;The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes the Hunted&quot; (Why do film titles have to be so long and confusing these days like train driver collective agreements?).
He delivers a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek portrayal: at heart, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere might have been if fate and the film industry weren&#39;t so kind: a man long past his very best, but who is himself as a ruin-like monument to its decline, it still has considerable remnants of its former charm.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, together with the German production Mörderischer Frieden, also starting this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
You can make short work of &quot;Mörderischer Frieden&quot;: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serb woman from Kosovar snipers, whereupon one of them promptly falls in love with her.
Although it&#39;s welcome that the Serbs aren&#39;t portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the film, which is flat for TV, quickly loses itself in banging and action.
It remains a kind of &quot;Alarm for Cobra 11&quot; without a freeway but with war.
On the other hand, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; is an exemplary way of investigating why there has actually never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian war criminal &quot;The Fox&quot; might have been a new &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; with a different director and a different screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at a different time can.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times, small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can&#39;t do, and both times it&#39;s a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; is that they don&#39;t just let Simon Hunt be the down-and-out cynic with heart that he is introduced to us as at the beginning.
No, the script also has to accuse him of having a romantic affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who was later murdered.
Finally, &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; goes down the drain when the reporters manage within the last five minutes in fast motion what NATO, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not managed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and bring justice to the Muslim Bosnians left to revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still walking around freely, and he suspects that the Americans and the French (on this point they should be in agreement for once) are not pursuing them too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the bad are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem springs to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet&#39;s work table: &quot;I see the swollen veins in my forehead with compassion, indicating: how exhausting it is to be evil&quot;.
Movies like &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; have just such swollen heads, but they hint at how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the Balkan war film genre.
It was recently reported in this newspaper that all of the Iraq films were Hollywood&#39;s big flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film either.
It is almost always the case that when a star roams the world&#39;s trouble spots or minefields, the result is something like &quot;Rangoon&quot; with Patricia Arquette, &quot;Beyond All Limits&quot; with Angelina Jolie or &quot;Blood Diamonds&quot; with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with &quot;Schindler&#39;s List&quot;.
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jackett&quot;, which are now considered classics, were by no means unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder comes in real time on two screens at home, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs screenwriters of the composure it takes to tell good stories.
After all, &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; or &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; became so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn&#39;t yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn&#39;t want to be good if you want to make good films.
Maybe you have to have novelist Lawrence Norfolk&#39;s sarcastically distant artist eye.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel &quot;Lemprière&#39;s Dictionary&quot; and the Balkan War, he replied: &quot;It&#39;s only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.&quot;
Von Beust is criticized for canceling the Olympics
The mayor&#39;s move away from Hamburg&#39;s application for the Summer Olympics has met with fierce criticism from politicians and businesspeople.
Many want to keep fighting for the water games.
But von Beust urges realism when assessing the chances.
The general manager of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a waiver as &quot;not good for the business location&quot;.
No other project has recently developed such great motivating forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
&quot;Without this goal, the political momentum in sport could not be maintained to the same extent.&quot;
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach &quot;based on a changed timeline&quot;.
Mayor Ole von Beust stuck to earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg&#39;s Olympic ambitions, at least until 2028, were unrealistic.
&quot;Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Confederation,&quot; said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected for early December on Munich&#39;s application for the 2018 Winter Games.
&quot;For us, this preference means that we will not have any realistic chances in the period up to 2028 that we have been considering.&quot;
Nevertheless, the dream is not over forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beust&#39;s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
&quot;It&#39;s too early to miss an opportunity by burying the plans at this point,&quot; said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application also contradicts the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception for the general assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There von Beust described Hamburg&#39;s application for the 2015 Universiade &quot;not as a substitute&quot; for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association nominated Hamburg as a candidate city just last week.
The SPD parliamentary group accused the Senate of not using valuable time to build housing in Hamburg.
&quot;The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it backed the Olympics and left out residential construction,&quot; said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for integrated planning for the Olympics and later residential use for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally relied on the &quot;event factor&quot;.
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics triggered great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
These are not Warhol&#39;s boxes
Anyone who associates the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden are currently casting dark shadows on Warhol&#39;s catalog raisonné.
Most of the ninety-four &quot;Stockholm type&quot; Brillo boxes listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol&#39;s Brillo boxes from 1968 a few months ago, internal investigations at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm have now come to a sobering conclusion: the six &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; that the former museum director Pontus Hultén donated to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - and probably also the majority of the approximately one hundred other Brillo boxes of the &quot;Stockholm type&quot; that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is convoluted, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 in New York, Warhol created his first &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot;, painted wooden boxes based on the red, blue and white design of the cardboard boxes of the &quot;Brillo&quot; soap powder.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol&#39;s consent - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes: These did not come from Warhol (for reasons of cost) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard box factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, although these were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes that rightly went down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation &quot;Type Stockholm&quot;.
Some of them have fetched more than $100,000 at auction.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then gave him.
In fact, Hultén&#39;s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that point, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at Moderna Museet, examined the six Brillo boxes belonging to the museum as well as three privately owned Swedish boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their chipboard panels were first primed and sanded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without a primer - moreover, it is not oil paint but acrylic paint.
&quot;These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol&#39;s Brillo boxes,&quot; says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: &quot;If the &#39;Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board&#39; in New York does not comes to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six cases in its collection as copies/exhibition material.&quot;
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the &quot;serious allegations&quot; made about the soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been a relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who had holed up in a Manila hotel and demanded the ouster of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and voter fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not be held responsible for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously stormed the hotel using tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been holed up in the building for hours.
Around half of them were on trial on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly break away with around 30 sympathizers.
The MPs who were supposed to be guarding him had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops cordoned off the area around the posh hotel.
The President called an urgent Security Cabinet meeting.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers&#39; actions.
&quot;People have had enough,&quot; said Trillanes.
&quot;We call on people to join us.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, who used to command the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units plan to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by allegations of corruption for months.
Manila&#39;s financial district was the main scene of the attempted mutiny by around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising collapsed after almost 24 hours because the army refused to join.
There have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines since 1986.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
You keep the option open to increase the share in Versatel.
United Internet announced that this step is intended to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market.
Speculations about an entry had already arisen on Wednesday after the Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
According to the financial market, the money house only holds the shares for a third party.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile communications company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have started talks about marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile phone products.
&quot;We are strengthening our partnership,&quot; explained a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies formed the MSP joint venture to take over competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a share of a good ten percent in Freenet and will not make use of their right to take over a further 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
The freenet poker game, which has been going on for months and is still difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete access customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch previously directly held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
