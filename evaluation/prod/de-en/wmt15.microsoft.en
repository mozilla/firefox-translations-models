The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third-largest economy.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defense cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before turning into bushland, where officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle, as well as a person matching the driver's description, were later seen at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of ignoring a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear before the district court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the indictment at a hearing by the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced legislation to establish union organization as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That's why I'm proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options for discrimination because of trade union organisation as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Supplementing the National Labour Law to provide an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise trade union representation, to seek justice in a civil court - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks unions have faced in recent years—in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country—Americans once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time millions of Americans remember when that country mentioned democracy, free speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that Hedki Tojo's militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role played by workers and their unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that "workers' rights to unification and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Acknowledging the fact that workers would have to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or seek to reduce this right shall be null and void; Measures aimed at this are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union—and for that union to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies—must be protected.
Indeed, after these rights have come under attack in America, it is very wise to recall the American ideal that working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would likely have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, billed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and set to go into effect Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to purchase a patient admission right to a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for the time being, doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while requesting such a right.
"Plaintiffs may continue to operate in accordance with the law while seeking to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within one month, a hearing for the judge is scheduled to bring about a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to gain hospitalization rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that physicians' admission rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor performing abortions in Louisiana has patient admission rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the rest of the doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor would stop performing the surgery out of fear for his safety, the group said.
Arguing against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient admission rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute online to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australia's rural areas are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than urban women.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research lead Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New Drugs Could Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of the women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions, and social and economic status also affected survival chances.
Older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecologic oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counter distances, she suggested as a possible remedy an increase in the service of flown in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to where they live, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic status, the study found poor long-term survival rates among women with ovarian cancer, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 from the Gold Coast, learned she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, along with a sharpened decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year as today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products," according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people with home ownership spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of paving front gardens for park purposes and declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to generate £5 billion in sales annually.
Greater London, where the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a 6-year period, has the lowest spending on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens doesn't mean people can't grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeownership numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station ceased operations for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, armed with sticks and stones, they clashed with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but Sharif refused.
Meanwhile, the country's army is calling for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without resorting to force."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has staged coups on a number of occasions.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's longest-serving US diplomat to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US embassy's chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept, reported that the work carried out by former US analyst at the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, shows that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany's main intelligence service also targeted Ankara provoked much more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Train drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The strike announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the German locomotive drivers' union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was remanded in custody by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, following allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of Mallorca's anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
Spain's national daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners said the authorities' nepotism had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a drinking spree.
Island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of drunken holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-soaked pub crawls.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage will jointly pay a €55,000 ($73,000) fine.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for a number of accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
First day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights departing from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on Sunday night.
The final rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a downpour that began just before 8pm and provided nearly 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell back to a high of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The gusty weather conditions likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind — a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance — and had to take off.
At that time, gusts of wind reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing approach and finally touched down at about 20:40.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is forecast on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for big networking
In the face of galloping technological progress that threatens to transform our comfortable homes into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my eyes fall on the spiral cable that connects the receiver to the phone, and I think: Wow, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind it: If it weren't for the cable, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector bought the rule that today's world first is tomorrow's e-waste - outdated.
And anyone who still has a tube TV in their living room, for example, is simply saying that they reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the push of the Ifa at the radio tower this week shows us again our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who used to master washing machines and CD players blindly, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread out in front of him with incredibly vain expert speak: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, is it still possible?
What are you supposed to talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it's all about networking our house.
So that the yogurt reorders itself, so that the fire detector tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could use the air conditioning from the office on our imminent arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, tell it loudly "Suction!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot drives off.
Mad.
"The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring," murmurs an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with headphones, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this is of no use because we are stuck in traffic.
From daily practice, we also know: If a newfangled device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-raid shelters, as rocket and mortar fire descended on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, leaving schools in Gaza closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel, marked by rocket bullet holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh kindergarten that was hit by a rocket removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident and English teacher at Kibbutz Saad.
Many children from our area desperately need a return to routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"Those were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza severely scarred by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire ensured an immediate end to the fighting; However, important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed were fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other strikes.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be open again soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU deputy Strobl questions NPD ban proceedings
In view of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, CDU federal deputy Thomas Strobl has spoken out in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU federal deputy Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," Strobl, who is also CDU state chief in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD narrowly failed to reach the five-percent hurdle in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt to ban the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003 because the Office for the Protection of the Constitution also had informants in the NPD leadership at the time.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join in.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now accommodated in tents.
The central reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the interior authority has set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These hasty actions continue to fuel citizens' reservations and give the district politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, leader of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg make currently unused houses available for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities can not provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the sharpest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely watched index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to RP data Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-tier market.
RP Data's figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent last year, while in Melbourne they rose by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent, respectively.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the onset of spring, we would now see an increase in properties for sale over the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test".
"Given the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate, and the persistently low interest rate environment, it's likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him posing "like a general".
This is not the style of the university, according to the statement.
For example, the Medau family had already been "informed orally about the university's request in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or even decisions", but that there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access road, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no talk of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to the current status, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking areas will only be used by students of the university in the future.
Parking is not used at all, because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking lots.
Thinking of local residents
According to the university president, the Bergwichtel nursery, which is located on the premises and whose front door would lead along the driveway to the parking deck, should "not be impaired".
Rather, he points out "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the junction with Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it's about much more than the particular interests of Messrs. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the nursery, with the expansion of the road one "of the few natural spots of Coburg would be lost" is justified, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, wants to inform the city councillors about the structural development of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university last week.
Accordingly, the access road for the new parking deck will not lead via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but over the Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be expanded to two lanes over a length of about one kilometre.
According to projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to my body's signals and end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Cup winner said on his Facebook page.
He is thus retiring internationally with a record of 167 caps and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the powerful backcourt player wants to go on the hunt for goals for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelander, who will announce his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches inspired me just as much as they will inspire my long-standing teammates and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double burden does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear in 2012 after a heel infection even his career end.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career leave no body unscathed.
I have some health issues that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot operations, which took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head, but not deceive my body," Glandorf explained in an interview with the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"If all else fails, I'm always ready to talk," the father of two told the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least reasonably straight.
In addition to winning the World Cup title in 2007 and the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2 percent in spring
Crises around the globe slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
From April to the end of June 2014, gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office, thus confirming preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone stimulated the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, GDP for the first half of the year as a whole increased by 0.8 percent compared with the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the finish of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmannstadt of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist's paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
Advertised in various trade journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland better in this way", the cyclists were pleased about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the clubhouse of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the Wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without problems and there were no negative incidents", Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see you again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to come back to the Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's relentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, what Konstantin Wecker, singer-songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, has put on paper in "Mönch und Krieger" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more scraps of thought by scrap of thought, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947 wrote down his memoirs, each chapter introduced by a suitable song text.
And he is brutally honest: from masturbation as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves out no human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Abstract, but all the more important concepts also take up a lot of space: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - he tries to get to the bottom of all this, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he was influenced not only by music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the bon vivant Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "through subtraction", as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary".
Between all the high-minded views, however, there are also brief anecdotes about grounding: for example, about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride in which he aimed head-on at a tree.
Here, too, he is ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get moving!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton—who were grown up when I was a kid—would take him to the pub and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket shot.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For much of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a bit lighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep Stygian mazes with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry off himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to put food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without any declarations of love from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn't until my mother was feeling bad towards the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through with this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be evident in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken over by the theater.
This was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
That's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started when he was only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny at New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted themselves black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret I did.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was among others as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef! known.
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels like you're just passing time or treading water a little."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should give it a try.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he loved it.
I felt I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.'"
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he needed to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
That was also well received, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, 'This is your destiny.'"
He says this, of course, with a THUNDERING voice.
So I'm sticking to it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts while he imitates people again and again.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant gratification from a hall full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you are always looking for that, you drive it into a wall.
I sometimes perform live at Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn't give me as much as it used to.
I ask him if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle section, and the end of a journey — I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah".
The access to the Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemeni media report traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Houthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads to Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb 'ghost employees'
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all state officials to remove "ghost employees" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to receive salaries even after they leave the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public sector when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in payments for "ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the civil service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officers will now have to appear at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure their biometric registration data is recorded, a government statement said.
All those who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the message continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the civil service by establishing the actual number of civil servants and also by cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Department of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil lawsuit at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and charged Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach had bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in the teaching profession for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many seasoned Petershausen and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his desire to see the human being in the student.
Sněžka is the most famous mountain in the Krkonoše Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
Already at the age of 14, after four years of high school, he became interested in the teaching profession.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp, they went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight car.
So Richter ended up in Senkendorf in Upper Franconia.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers six times a week to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk three kilometers across the whole city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he passed the first state examination and in 1954 after three years as a trainee teacher the second state examination.
Since Upper Franconia had no vacant teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "official apartment" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room official apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach had been closed in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built at municipal expense and cellar rooms during the expansion in 1997, although this was not eligible for subsidies according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who replied to a report by a school board on law and justice: "One must never forget love". Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: "That doesn't always work". Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought each other, they did not get punishment from him and were not condemned to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-party judge after his retirement to run in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council.
But Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4 BIKE TOUR 700 cyclists make stopovers in the spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of people resting alone made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour and accompanying entourage enjoyed a break in the lower spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and later an open-air party in Schotten's Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it got serious: The cyclists tackled the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 trays of apple, plum, crumble and cheesecake, which tasted wonderful to the capable cyclists.
"Only country women can bake such cakes," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drinks stand of the gymnastics club Geiß-Nidda cold refreshments could be purchased.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park had a relaxing effect.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserves it, after all, he has already reattached broken bicycle chains today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the operations manager still had to work: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinking spa and took the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Even promotion manager Tobias Hagen, who has been a tour guide since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, could only take a short breather, as he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hesse police using three telephones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but cyclists also came from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the health resort when they left after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had been given a nice festive ambience and, of course, treats such as tarte flambée with well-chilled Federweißer had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased about the "many companies in Schotten".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging movement in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bicycle.
Among the guests were increasingly citizens who were just as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
Police authorities made no immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organised criminal organisation and tapping telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described their actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, which attends Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the rest of life.
The first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She arrives with a proud string of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front-line experience.
She began her career at global management consulting firm Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and stepped down when the top job at parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their severance pay reportedly amounted to almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Back in May, I described the chairman's job with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand at the heart of public life as a vast and complex entity, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: internally on the front guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also externally as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost untenable duopoly that calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new-arriving leader would risk stepping in, beating on everything, and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps depriving himself of his job in the process.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC downsized - power, money and status outdated.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties is fraught with particular dangers for the BBC.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
Viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my phone and later see missed programs on my iPlayer.
But it remains a much-loved and remarkable institution.
It needs a respectable chairman - I hope it has found him.
Perry from Texas says disparaging tweet was unauthorized
A tweet from the official account of Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry's user account, which denied the previous one.
I just sent a tweet from my account that wasn't authorized by me.
"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted it," the later message read.
Perry employees did not respond promptly to requests for comment.
Although the tweets came from Perry's official user account, it wasn't clear who was actually serving the feed.
The earlier tweet painted an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed funding from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry — who could potentially be a presidential candidate in 2016 — before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with three times the allowable alcohol level ... but if I do, I'll sue Governor Perry if he leaks it."
I'm the drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not tasked with directing the grand jury investigation into Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty, calling the charges a political ploy.
His high-class team of lawyers asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law targeting the longest-serving governor in Texas history was unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and investigates Texas state corruption cases — when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is frequently updated — and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa polls during his 2012 presidential bid, Perry responded to speculation that he would quit by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, here we come!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal" again
One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and the subject of huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to set mortgage caps in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive officer of high-end construction firm Berkeley, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since peaking in 2013," adding that this provides a "stable operating environment."
The property market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers crowded into the capital.
According to information from the cadastral office, prices in the urban area jumped by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices on Berkeley's private, low-cost, and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound in recent months has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers – some of whom have also been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "villa tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that April's mortgage market report, which unveiled tighter lending rules, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage approval in July, also suggesting that the property market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for house prices in London to rise in 2015 downwards to 3 percent, based on already weakening house price awareness.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, wanting to own a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, as the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations has remained stable and as a result, forward sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April — nearly a third more than when it peaked in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit grew by 40 per cent annually to £280 million, and turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a note Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said Berkeley's revenue this year is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts unanimously estimate annual pre-tax profit at £450m.
Berkeley shares were firm at £23.96 in London trading in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the "The Hunger Games" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and charged the hacker with "blatant invasion of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who repost the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a loophole in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World," also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with yourselves," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted: "These so-called nude pictures of me are FAKE, folks.
Let's fight back at the beginning. *pun intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted away, that's the best way to describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman would tell him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratchy.
He was prickly, like in hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this prickedness was an affair that was just beginning, which had been more promising than usual for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a North Island village even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a humid but paradisiacal valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the baths, slugs had left their mark on all the windows, believing it all belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had absentmindedly latched into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing messages when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer that his father had liked to listen to with the shutters in the house closed.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their very own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolescenized, just like the word obsolescen.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have been able to do, and just as people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels for books, so they chose ballads for music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing about Ailinn's big feet in a grossly comic serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz, although not directly forbidden, was not played.
Improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The same goes for the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning work phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN IT HAD HAPPENED - out of fear of being accused of stoking fires, even out of fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, held on and became depressed with inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn had a hard time understanding how the offensive words Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers to his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a bit strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see all over the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she says without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your big ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe that's what he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in a storm.
"And your stubbornness is exactly why I'm perversely attracted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear she showed in her eyes as she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more grumpy of WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their ancestors as smugglers and beachcombers, went from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hands against a woman who refused or ridiculed them.
Mule?
They would have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They first kiss - kissing was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - first kiss them and then hit them.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the kissing itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt leaden, but the force of his grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him move away - just as her companion watched him from an upstairs room - a man weighed down by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just recounted, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, was working on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public sentiment, on a short lecture on the continuing low- and middle-level violence in the very parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, is most likely to be expected.  in view of the money and energy that had been invested in eradicating this violence.
"Much has already been done, and much remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically rarely been felt, despite the towering church spires between hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps listening to sentimental ballads, gets intoxicated by stories of difficulties overcome and claims to firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former rawness hold the hands of rural communities as well as our urban fabrics, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and devious quarrelsomeness at home.  at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is an unprejudiced workplace.
We serve an unprejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can occasionally skew results like you've imagined.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "devious" and "raw," might as well be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and vitality.
To continue to ride on what happened, when it happened, as if it had happened yesterday if it had happened, is to deprive the country of its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you are getting at," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I am not saying anything other than that we are not yet healed as effectively as we delude ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, it is not the others on whom we vent our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you call actions that our grandparents may or may not have made.
You also go too far when you say that they have vented their "anger" and "distrust" of "others."
It shouldn't really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past and protect the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others."
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I am not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened happened.
That was back then.
Nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt needs to be assigned, no debt needs to be paid off if such repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to repay it.
But what is the purpose of the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves us to forget it.
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider her report," he said, and dismissed her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven onto the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were targeting police accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, announcing that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" who were about to be armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Forces staff, after receiving several intelligence reports, acted that there were some elements operating within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had given the impression of a coup.
"Even though no one has claimed to have usurped the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces so far show signs of a coup d'état," he said.
Lesotho military spokesmen said on Sunday that the soldiers were withdrawing to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he was targeted because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been major tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Eurozone output at a 13-month low
The increase in output in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in 13 months, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced slumps at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a sluggish eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details later this week as to whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, along the lines of that made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While small growth is better than no growth at all, the dampening impact of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers has become more apparent," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a problem child, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are no longer effective are also not reassuring," said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely fueling the fire of analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about the August eurozone manufacturing PMI is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone seem to find life quite difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions – particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine – add to uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was "becoming more and more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The hellish decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in revulsion, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl photographed trying to climb back into the shot-up school gym
She was photographed by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and became famous when she tried to climb back into the shot-up school gym in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were presumed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
Some shrapnel is still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says combatively.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo online of me climbing back to school, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help prevent something like this from happening again.
The boy who escaped through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians start school at 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, embracing his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and been hospitalized with leg injuries, assuming that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-defunct News of the World) to be named Barnardo's Children's Champion by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or are dead.
We say that they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy shop where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried as I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: "I always think that this world has not gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just as children as ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not possibly have survived in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became the symbol of the atrocities of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-soaked face was scarred with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, so my little boy stayed there alone for three horrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I mean, it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days haunt me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Insistent: The image of Georgiy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgiy wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden in our bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and am attending a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgiy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to join the FSB as an intelligence officer but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in that famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on his laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this and, of course, they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the commemoration celebrations.
I know that Georgy will not go.
It must be much more intense for him, because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that He was given back to me. Here in Beslan everyone is marked by it.
It remains in us.
Georgiy is an adult now, but that horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can walk, but not do sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only adds to my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could have given me, but my heart weeps for those killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world -- wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The baby who was so poignantly carried to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is brought to safety by a Russian special task force (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when baby Alyona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty restrained her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Alyona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of running over girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for running over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl at the Pittenween crossing in East Neuk.
The prosecution states that Mr. Steward drove his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the accusation in Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC scheduled the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for around $300.
I took these photos at a family celebration with multiple cameras, all of which are priced at under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and shooting modes that optimize the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models in our buyer's guide and reviews.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, but action cams usually don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it's difficult to watch underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So you take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the farther you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake, or ocean.
This will also allow you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.
It's especially important if you're working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you'll need to get closer to your objects if you want them to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was the kind whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organisation as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to sparing the sick both the agony of illness and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors care about diagnoses and diseases, while those treated are mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble pulling myself together.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently reproaching his wife, Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to take an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pleura, the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers before.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that we can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily pledged to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesolhelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is because mesothelioma takes decades to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and often still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices where we work, the schools where we study and the shops where we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from London's elegant department stores to private schools, are not shelters.
The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to get well, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
Indeed, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormen - uses the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who contracted mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one still alive."
How many more of us will fall ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many more of us will get sick?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to stop, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A quick glance at the files of the courts, to which those affected often turn for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she joined M&S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestosform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor plates, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a "major health risk" with possible fatal consequences.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is clear, yet indirect evidence, that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, in which it is shown that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure from work or in the home were probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts, he said, are due to the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people at the heart of government may have been unknowingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and piping behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibres of which could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a 'clean health certificate', it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work will have to be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs are likely to meet at the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than at the  the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he still remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009 when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 and was undergoing surgery late at night.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't be able to make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Astonished doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleural cathethers to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbott's came to his office with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the pleura and the pleura.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't that worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was available in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to hire a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the scale of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people have probably had the first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Websites now frequently address the issue of asbestos in schools.
And meanwhile, such innocent objects in our homes as floor tiles or shed roofs have included asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison that's in much of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his Guy's Hospital case.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the biggest difficulties was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very hard to absorb it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How long do I have left?'
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to live to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism — breathing itself — that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is whirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital Andrew Lawson suspects exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "the breathing process pushes them to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the start.
The usual options for other cancers don't work as well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some think it's worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"You can't cut out the pleura," he says.
You can't get around it with a knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "doesn't respond very well to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling agency for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he happily introduced himself during calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and would probably extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting with several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardiothoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred to me, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to take advantage of the best therapies available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are left with a different financial concern — about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that people realized that even very low exposure posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full-fledged compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, following the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesperson confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation to attribute the fatal asbestos contact to a company or workplace — usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there has been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers can no longer be found.
The Act has set up a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process – about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many people with mesothelioma, thinks £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal by insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Secretary of State for Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths a day, swift action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy — a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt empowered.
"That's one of the most important things, of course," says Abbott.
This can be seen again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm gone, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
When you receive bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had an illness that I wouldn't grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as ultimately also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to vote for government, protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, China's parliament ruled against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by Hong Kong electorate.
This move is likely fueling the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it does make us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing had promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice secretary-general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said allowing public nominations in the elections would be too "chaotic" for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents elect the presidency from 2017.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens direct voting rights, but the decision also makes clear that China's leaders are firmly in control of the process through a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer that saw some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort, an action that will only take place when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and tightened security measures including police forces and barricades were in place outside the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There are also growing fears that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, as they endangered business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they're talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong's democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that attracted 780,000 people — more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to universities, where Freshmen are offered performances by private plane.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private planes, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Along with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring students reach university with a minimum of effort and luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet as the service had just been launched, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also said it expects a market for this offering, despite tuition fees of £9,000 per year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and aspirations from those of 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as aloof.
Megan Dunn, NIS Vice-President for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting their studies this month are facing a cost of living crisis as the financial aid available in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep up with soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticize race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in white feminists' online discussions.
In her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and received attention across the country, Perez saw that white women's responses were 100% about race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays titled "Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About the Oppression of Women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you find a lot of people in feminism talking about being white and privilege in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're in, and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women face every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post about people of color being under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship but not about safety in public spaces?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality throughout U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now associate the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women campaigners for women's suffrage like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only succeed for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and black suffrage should come later," Hattery said.
Remembering such things makes you realize with power why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group originated nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson—police behavior, racial discrimination—is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the problems black women had grappled with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a trenchant article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist for the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding an inherent danger to the body — and opinions about race that are markedly different in public polls — will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism that addresses both race and gender issues, some of her comments on the issue of race in America are baffling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. Border Patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface again — this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to reconsider the issue as an essential women's issue, all she needed to do was publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in women's organizations," she said.
"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included an image of the house's living room — which included a pig that had its head resting on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly published and has since been removed," said a spokeswoman for the company.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom single-family home."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale caused interest on social media as some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
It's the turn of a Harvey lottery player this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with one lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey drew the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, up from $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to get in touch.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit was a talking point in the small town in south-west Perth.
The city doesn't talk about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated first-division wins last month, fittingly ending a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of August's five millionaires after a Belmont couple made the mega win of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas invited to the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful round of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting troops from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", who used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic duels in various gladiator genres.
First it was the turn of the "provocators" with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg splint on the left leg and bracelet on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and throwing lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who competed with a throwing net, trident and dagger against the "Secutor" and after a short fight pushed the boy to the ground.
Then the swords crashed metallically against each other, the shields clattered and the throwing lances flew buzzing through the arena, so that one could be afraid and anxious for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive everyday Roman life and make the culture of Roman times tangible," said Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", explaining the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "oppidum romanum", a Roman city, for one day, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his welcoming address.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remnants of it could also be admired at Roman Day, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company contrasted the water and energy supply then and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveyor Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented Roman surveying instruments such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the clay footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Preservation of Archaeological Monuments at the Rhineland Regional Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
Perimeter walls of a farm building with a kiln for drying grain and malting were found.
The building probably belonged to a villa rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germanic tribes in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal styluses on wax tablets like the Roman students once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach make glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim operate a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
With the faithfully recreated Roman touring car pulled by two cold-blooded horses, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Grammar School, which presented the results of its "Roman Project Weeks" here.
With a Roman Week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also be involved in the Rhineland-wide proclaimed Roman Year 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the local history and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and recall Wachtberg's Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will talk about his work on the draughty Wachtberg, plants will be presented as living monuments from Roman times and a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and Romans who have moved here will be presented.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
The Roman Week is intended to make it possible to experience the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg again.
In the Wachtberg town hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matron Sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic weighs on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are deserted - and international companies are distancing.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealing a severe blow to West Africa's economy.
The harvest is rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets deserted - the virus has severely affected the region.
Some international companies are already distancing themselves.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," said Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at Liberia's capital, Monrovia, the second-largest market.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people falling victim to the fever alone.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Across resource-rich countries, companies are suspending operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their hometowns to get supplies.
In some quarantined areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the stock of staple foods such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with damage to its image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may get the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also puts a strain on the strained national budgets of the states
The disease also puts a strain on the already strained national budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by the high expenditure on the health system and additionally by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Sagittarius celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
Preparations for the 50th anniversary celebration from 12 to 14 September are in full swing at the Tannenwald shooting club.
On Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 18 o'clock is the big firecracker shooting.
Afterwards there is the evening of atmosphere with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" in the large marquee.
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the prize distribution of the Federal and Gauschießen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
The patrons are Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association for "social entertainment by means of exercises in indoor and small-caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who launched the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau on 30 April in the Gasthaus Lukas.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting champions through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly a matter of finding a club premises and installing the shooting operation.
Already in autumn 1965, the shooting club started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round-robin competitions.
In the following years, the sport shooters, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, Pastor Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shooting rooms on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, combined with the ceremonial consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the shooting club celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a firecracker group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became firecracker consultant.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Firecracker Meeting 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the club members modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round-robin competitions
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in the round-robin competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one KK1 sport pistol, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was promoted from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has been promoted from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as Bockstich, carnival and royal ball, club outing and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without speaking to journalists.
His team principal Chad Johnston said his 14-man team was disappointed but was now focusing on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We drive to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in Sunday night's race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed up and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at a cinder track race in upstate New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a spot in the pursuit.
He returned to work while an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. He had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities said on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart faces charges.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start in 12th position, Stewart had already advanced into the top 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart on lap 122, Buschs
Car number 18 out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars hitting the wall.
Stewart continued, but dropped back to 21st place.
Looking for young dancers
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to meeting fellow campaigners.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn also struggle with all-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated considerably.
Now they are increasingly looking for young talent for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can get a taste of the training session on Thursdays between 5 and 6 pm or Fridays between 5 and 6.30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training regularly begins with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance films and we have already spent the night in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz dance, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Every Wednesday, children and young people can get a taste of lessons in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you fancy Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can stop by and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for a month and are demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director General for the Implementation of Punitive Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
The protest by prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tank battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army gave up the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter jet and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in clashes in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coast guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
Ukraine's Border Patrol confirmed that two of its ships came under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had taken control of several villages in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine was also to participate.
In the run-up, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is abiding by the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a blatant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show "that they regard us as opponents."
Strengthening NATO's presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official reports, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.
The European Union is still waiting for a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: toll will come "very clearly"
Now the Chancellor is once again clearly committed to this.
But it is not a carte blanche for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
After persistent resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll.
"To put it very clearly: It is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin.
For the time being, however, Merkel did not commit herself to a detailed model.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal, and it is now being worked on."
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Angela Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was also contributing constructively to the consultations on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left on Sunday a "mirror" report uncommented, his house is examining its own concept to remunerate highway investors with toll revenues – after the election in 2017.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice-President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be tolled," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU state chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk about the topic again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background to this are fears that a toll will affect local border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU.
The Left sees the plans as failed in view of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, however, domestic car owners may not be additionally burdened.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll through the motor vehicle tax.
However, according to EU law, the model may not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she was going to die as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth believing that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) — a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK shared that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsteady gait and curved toes.
Sufferers also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) — a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two, who is now 51, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I kept falling down and everything took me longer.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with the other children and was often teased at school for my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at age 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she looked at her medical record when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty for being curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the illness in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, slowly losing all my abilities in between.
I did it all on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities hadn't declined as much as she had imagined and consulted her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff Sergeant (ret.) Berni Diether has been working as a firecracker since the closure of the former military training area
For almost ten years, there has been no shooting on the former military training area in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, lethal ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere area during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last live shot was fired at the Münsingen military training area, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500 hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
An economic recovery means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local corporate tax assessments in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia region collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local entities in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden rose 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by services agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of that profit came from large states like California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid over $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective at increasing state and local tax revenues, where real estate taxes amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax assessments.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"Here's what happens in Maryland: a large portion of real estate, particularly in the D.C. tax jurisdiction, is either owned by the government or by nonprofits that don't pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the housing market
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Businesses in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly in all three places.
The increase rate in the district was in line with the national average at 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes at 6 percent in all three departments (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent in Maryland and a relatively high 9.975 percent in the district.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia charges lower state and local corporate taxes and has a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
In the study, the district was not examined.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to cut its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and as a result, they are paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen — a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized — in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with a 6.2 percent increase in overall defense tax revenues for the state and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cuts impact the region's labor market.
Twin city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin city in China now wants a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during the visit of an SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the functionary of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, promised the host that he would ask around Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already radiates this joie de vivre, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou toasted with Schäfer-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said deputy party leader Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business traffic between our two cities continues to increase."
Currently, travelers have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Cultivated partnership
The affable vice-party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the german-China connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, she wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "keeps their fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago; However, her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We are all keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep her sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners, which come on the market from today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 on which the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the appliance at a glance.
For new cars, stricter nitrogen oxide values apply in the emission class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: They receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported Monday morning: The online retailer -- and video producer, and a host of other things -- is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a Twitch acquisition, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion was a done deal, and the collaboration seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded as a Justin.tv just three years ago, had launched as a general streaming service — a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers who wanted to publish their bravura pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which know-it-alls give the (mostly older) games a veneer of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was received a bit bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't materialize, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather exercise than watch, it's hard to comprehend the attraction of watching others play rather than picking up the control console.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a weirdo get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so watching without your own control over your gaze perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast-forward in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless there's a game or humor virtuoso around, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is visited by 55 million unique visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch integrating with Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like to have: thousands of young men being courted as advertisers.
As Twitch Chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium is showing no signs of shrinking, not even — gulp — as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy downpour on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors set off for the open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedelers, but also guests from the near and far surroundings, had made themselves comfortable around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, tapped their feet to the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And that across generations.
While some were lounging on blankets on the specially carted white sand at the beach bar, others feasted on a quarter of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But also with the children's make-up, the volunteers literally had their hands full to master the rush and conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.
The older ones used the foosball tables or took part in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he rained down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But this did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival.
"More people came than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board."
Therefore, nothing stands in the way of a repeat of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made it clear to the Volksstimme in a first balance sheet on Sunday.
He described it as annoying that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who cavorted in the Burggarten.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks'n'Rox broke off their performance because of this.
The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound.
The planned hookah lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a flat tire.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful in terms of visitor numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers have to take criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have overworked yourself a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same point.
Others do not see the initial problems quite so narrowly.
I think it's very good that some people don't just talk stupidly, but also really try to get something going.
Hats off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to remedy these points of criticism.
New radome in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark is shrinking
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be inserted into the striking building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 meters, the new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old hull is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather cooperates, the action will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge twists her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so hard when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so hard during the Ice Bucket Challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shrieked so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I was screaming, and as I did, my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost laughed, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to have her jaw relocated after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull together again?
Recently, there have always been disputes between the two Wolfratshauser castle associations.
Now the board members are thinking about a possible cooperation.
The late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, cited the project in Guédelon, France, as a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshausen Castle.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the points of view on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be extremely different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks on a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) when asked by our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together," says Sjöberg.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
In this way, visible successes can be achieved more quickly.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in mind until the end, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and experience" of the area is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Second Chairman of the Friends of Burg, was very happy about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has presided over the Friends of the Castle.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September in a general meeting.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we put the association's activities on hold out of respect." This "phase of thought" was necessary to "consider how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into conversation with the castle association.
Until then, the castle friends could also get a current mood picture within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he lives in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much like to continue to work".
In Piffl's eyes, the different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the near future.
He pays tribute to Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
Due to a high participation of the population as well as volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But over time, I've become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward." A "unique selling point" could be created for the rafting town.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"That's why I personally don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hoped that the Burgverein might move a bit on this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first "is important and good".
After that, we could look further.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks is more than $1,000 per year for many students, near-second-semester student Matt Schroeder came up with a clever savings idea.
He invented a lending system for books from high semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college administration said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there are various cost containment options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than when they bought them.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring, said Neebo's vice president, Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the multiplication table for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost only a third of the price they can be bought online at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used for sale
If you don't mind other people's notes or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is available used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com on a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors if previous spending was permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the term papers.
In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Hire
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them, and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent on the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of one semester for about $20.
Find out about the rules of the store you are renting from, including any penalties that may apply for writing notes, underlining or signs of use.
Tenants beware: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, as well as Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics are free to download these days, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for book pricing, as it allows you to be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, according to Gault, you should check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a blockbuster
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone grossed less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" grossed only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-tailored film "Sex Tape" grossed just $14.6 million on its opening weekend, while children's films like "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappointed in terms of revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in the case of children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year" yet for children's films and described "How to Train Your Dragon 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer movie release screened on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and this year.
The results are based on the opinion of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year's hit films are on par with last year's.
Some commentators suggest that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-released Jungle Book movie, told the Hollywood Reporter, "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to run after the past.
In contrast to the current weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated $1.2 billion in streaming content revenue, almost double last year's $837 million in revenue.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on film adaptations of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a kernel of truth.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical," telling The Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one is going to worry about business anymore."
When the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled a few years ago in order to streamline the league division, it was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to its programme.
The result: Those who have not ascended have been relegated.
Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo has avoided relegation in the Oberliga relegation, but will only play fifth-tier in the coming season.
Fourth-class Torpedoes ladies remain, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga no Göttingen clubs are represented.
For the women, TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo runner-up in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better Bezirksklasse is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC compete here.
In the Bezirksliga Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the Bezirksklasse the TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The Bezirksoberliga of the ladies begins at least in target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small district league.
Also the district league relay of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV start the season in a district class.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
The East Relay includes Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at district level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd district classes reaches target strength, here the innovative and bustling district board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments for us over the weekend and spoke to protesters who travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO juvenile bushwalkers were brought to safety with the winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday noon for their tour.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party of local police and emergency services set out and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at around 11pm.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescue workers stayed overnight with the couple, and they were flown out Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital by ambulance in stable condition.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The station had resumed broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters, equipped with sticks, had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
The police said that about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it had come on Monday again to clashes of around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital information, a policeman was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to make their way to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday evening after a meeting at the army headquarters for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force."
The statement continued: "The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has fueled fears of military intervention, which has staged coups in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to hold out.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri made similar comments.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially held out peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer in third place in the standings after his second win of the season.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday came to a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interim low with the exit in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with Green-White.
Schrammel dream goal puts Rapid on the road to victory With their second win of the season, Rapid have shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and go into the international break with a sense of achievement.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said full-back Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent lead volley from the sixteen corner in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd take all the frustration from Thursday and snap it under the bar," said the 26-year-old with a smile.
When Schrammel scored for the last time in a Bundesliga match on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in rapid dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid junior team," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvic injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his job very well there as well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirror-inverted.
He deserved the goal, he has already provided some assists this year," praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also provided the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after just over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written to.
"Thank God we were a bit lucky today," said Schrammel, alluding to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results were not right, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even said that they had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team showed that it has character".
No less pleasing for him: "That we finally played to zero again".
A lot of work during the international break The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several retirements, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting eleven, makes the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," warned Barisic, who in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic lost players "who have been very stable recently".
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One person who probably finds the break particularly convenient is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself up for the team, goes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure before his substitution in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who played his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from the game since 2 November 2013 (4-2 over Admira).
Hofmann: "We must not believe that everything is fine now" "We have certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point luck has to come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
Of course, he urged continued concentrated work: "You can't always see it in black and white.
We haven't played as badly in recent weeks as we have been portrayed.
But we must not believe that everything is fine now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.
He regretted the quick goal "from the category magic goal", as well as the regular goal by Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly disallowed by referee Kollegger.
The only reproach I can make of the team is that we weren't concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We didn't have enough deals.
Central defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found our way in and even scored a goal.
On the whole, more would have been possible.
Under this treetop there is peace
We showed a mighty trunk in our puzzle task of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees still exist in the district, the specimen pictured is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It goes past paddocks, basalt piles and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry of the Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument looks vital, it rises above the other trees in the area and is reminiscent of an American sequoia with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only clues to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheim archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what significance it has with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago, the goatherds are said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stone-freed meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers, exhausted from the ascent, are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because herds of goats are actually grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, you should exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for vipers.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which climb up towards the Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the moated castle?
However, a moated castle, which is sought for our next task, is rather rare to find at altitude.
The reflection in the moat already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building portrait could fit.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's Prime Minister and current EU President, Matteo Renzi, pushed through the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, succeeding Britain's Catherine Ashton.
As the pro-government daily La Repubblica reports, Renzi sees the appointment of Mogherini, who is also regarded as the favourite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects this to boost his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to pacify the left-wing party base, which repeatedly revolts against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit in a rather moderate way.
According to the prevailing opinion in Rome, a political balance will be achieved vis-à-vis the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish nominee Donald Tusk, who has been nominated for the Council of Nations.
Because the chief diplomat of the EU will also be deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will rise to the "enormous challenges".
Born in Rome, she is married and has two daughters.
The doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita in 2008 to form today's social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became vice-president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the Left Democrats, she entered high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, of which she soon became head.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on the NATO mission in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, cultivated contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's more than 40 percent vote in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has a share in it, as is noted in PD circles.
The accusations in Brussels that the new EU foreign policy chief has too little diplomatic experience, i.e. lacks substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are pursued and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gazprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy supply.
After Renzi began his term as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos showing her shake-hands with Putin were met with outrage in Brussels, as was the fact that she invited the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training occupations: electronics technician (three trainees), mechatronics technician (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended Hauptschule, Mittelschule and Realschule.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the trainers travel to Oberammergau for a team-building event, where a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees across all cohorts is 27.
The Socialists in France should "shut up and put France in order," said François Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "its love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side," he said to great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge France's controversial 35-hour week, despite strong calls for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw a spanner in the works by appearing at a meeting of renegade socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for taking away the French people's "faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the Socialists' constant trench warfare and said she could not imagine the new Valls government holding out for more than a few months.
François Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls doesn't have one either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn't even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of winning early elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in local elections in March and the right-wing National Front came out on top in May's EU elections.
A poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. NCHL. O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry insiders.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships as well as its wealthy clientele, while it would compete with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL. N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end inconclusively.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO. N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues in 2013 were $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent over the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed for an IPO with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise in its current form was formed in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise collectively own 82 percent of passenger capacity on U.S. cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises' IPO.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A pro-Beijing group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for Hong Kong's leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first gain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with pro-Beijing members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat and paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China's Party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication in June of a Beijing white paper outlining China's hegemony over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, with hundreds of thousands marching into the city's business district and organizing a sit-in.
Li's interrogation is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The vice-chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, were to be questioned later in the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the top executive's office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not envisage any democratic elements until the final phase of 150 years of colonial rule in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine needed to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to defend his rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the riots began five months ago: helping the separatists capture territory and putting pressure on the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed region of Novorussia de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with state TV channel Kanal Eins, Putin condemned Ukraine's military campaign to retake separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which was seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently referred to the captured territory as "Novorossiya" or "Novorossiya," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are hoping for early peace talks in the wake of Ukrainian politicians' campaigns for the Oct. 26 elections and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held areas are "trapped in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of its 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict polls showed a broad majority in favor of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give Ukraine's regional governments the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area linking Russian territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of Russia's navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The region between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in his inauguration speech on 7th June suggested that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the constitution that give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whom Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with separatist leaders came after another rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk in a coup that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port of 500,000 inhabitants located between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two Russian columns of tanks and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reports in Kiev on Saturday.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian incursion in Ilovaisk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal involving Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger at hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of A-list celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is in a state of excitement after a series of clear photos of a nude Jennifer Lawrence in a celebrity hacking scandal surfaced online.
The hacker responsible for this probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Hunger Games" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne allegedly also had private photos published due to an iCloud vulnerability.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected felt "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying topless in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked images.
A representative of Lawrence told TMZ: "It's a heinous invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing more than selling stolen goods."
From a purely legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for Children with Cancer".
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, was an easy training for others.
However, everyone agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberurseler Brauhaus cycled to the Feldberg yesterday.
For a good cause.
He can easily put away the small sore muscles, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Children with Cancer" (Frankfurt) has also brought him personally a valuable insight.
A great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - great!"
A little break on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in the morning dew to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the eleven-kilometre stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green politician from the district council, who appeared all in red - red dress, red bike - made something understated at the start ("Lots of professionals, arriving is the goal!"), but then proved to be half a professional on the mountain and crossed the finish line after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He also drove through the route in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be part of it - we would have done a ride today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to Oberursel in the morning, only to pedal back to the heights immediately afterwards.
Florian Zierz from Frankfurt had swung into the saddle at home at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
"Fritten-Toni" also had fun.
For the boss of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had targeted 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo road bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I'm happy to be part of it," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the road with the "fixie bike", which are also racing bikes, but without gears...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed up to the summit over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz proved that it was easy to climb up to the summit even without a bike, but also by a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain rescue doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who ensured safety with his team, equipped with all-wheel drive bully and quad, said: "I know" him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sledge himself". So the man is, so to speak, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - more than ever before - had been sent out in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
