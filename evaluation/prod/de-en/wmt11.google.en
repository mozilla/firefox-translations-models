What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the &quot;pastry shop&quot;.
The new councilors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old and new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz asked members of the new ČSSD council how they speak the notorious slang that has become commonplace in recent years, when the current coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Prague&#39;s political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new councils were somewhat in the dark about these new terms.
At least that&#39;s what they claim.
&quot;Who is Voldemort?&quot;
&quot;No idea.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m more of a newcomer to Prague politics,&quot; said Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilor for culture, in response to the &quot;sponsor&#39;s vocabulary&quot; test.
But councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term &quot;golf hole&quot;.
&quot;That&#39;s the only expression you&#39;ve given me here that I use from time to time.&quot;
&quot;Otherwise I don&#39;t think much of slang.&quot;
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year ahead of the ODS election congress, the editors selected six terms, primarily those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms &quot;Voldemort&quot;, &quot;Prague&#39;s biggest golf hole&quot;, &quot;go to the pastry shop&quot;, &quot;bull&#39;s neck&quot;, &quot;treason of the capital&quot; and &quot;cover up&quot;.
Three Prague councilors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - initially promised to take part in the discussion, but then didn&#39;t even pick up the phone.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
&quot;I don&#39;t care about these things and I don&#39;t judge how the conservative democrats talk to each other.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s important to me how we understand each other within the framework of our programs,&quot; he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not recognize in the above-mentioned headline that Roman Janoušek, the influential businessman and friend of the ex-Mayor Bém, is being referred to.
The term &quot;Voldemort&quot; means absolutely nothing to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was &quot;the largest golf hole in Prague&quot;.
&quot;That&#39;s the Tunnel Blanka,&quot; says Kaucký, but added to be on the safe side: &quot;But I know that from the newspaper.&quot;
And jokingly: &quot;I&#39;ll probably have to take a language course.&quot;
The &quot;golf hole&quot; is then correctly deciphered as the Blanka tunnel not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by environmental councilor Lukáš Plachý.
However, both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even has an inkling of where this figure can be found and therefore also what it means to &quot;go to the pastry shop&quot;.
&quot;I think that means going to any Prague restaurant,&quot; Plachý is pretty close to solving the riddle, knowing that this is the seat of Janoušek&#39;s company.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims that he got this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary is his own.
In fact, judging by the test takers, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
&quot;I also asked my colleagues, but obviously we really don&#39;t have anything like that.&quot;
&quot;We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames,&quot; says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - casually called &quot;Hulda&quot; by his party comrades.
&quot;I was called Bříza (Birch) at school, but I don&#39;t know if my colleagues call me that too,&quot; Karel Březina tells us about his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councilor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades as &quot;grandfather&quot; or less friendly as &quot;old man&quot;, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations in party sponsorship, is called &quot;Igráček&quot; (known Czech Lego -figure) called.
Nicknames are the only thing the Social Democrats allow in intra-party parlance.
Hulínský reportedly doesn&#39;t like being called &quot;Hulda&quot;, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname &quot;Doctor of Baton Rights&quot; is said to have something to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský earned his Doctor juris title at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of &quot;witches&quot; and has published a brochure
Women labeled witches in Burkina Faso tend to share some common societal characteristics.
They tend to belong to the older generation, they cannot find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women &quot;becomes&quot; a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
&quot;Men are rarely affected by this fate.&quot;
&quot;Even young and healthy women are spared this because they help with the work and give birth to children,&quot; describes a nun who takes care of more than 100 women in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso communities were expelled.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal &quot;social measure&quot;.
And for this reason published a brochure intended to stop the &quot;hunting of witches&quot;.
But there is a catch.
&quot;More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,&quot; the newspaper &quot;derStandard&quot; pointed out to the dilemma of written education.
Being accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured petroleum over her and simply set her on fire.
The BBC server, among others, also reported on this incident.
However, the perpetrators claimed it was just a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil used for ritual anointing was ignited.
And that was after the group tried to &quot;exorcise an evil spirit&quot; from the woman.
The isolation of &quot;witches&quot; support the people here regardless of their education.
&quot;Der Standard&quot; quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: &quot;Eaters of human souls were a danger then as now,&quot; he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president got involved last year.
&quot;President Yahya Jammeh launched a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, claiming they had a hand in her death and were now trying to kill the President himself with black magic.&quot;
&quot;To do this, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president&#39;s bodyguards, forcibly kidnapped women and men who had been arrested at random from Gambian villages and brought them to the president&#39;s farm in Kanilai,&quot; said the organization Amnesty International in their report.
At the farm, incarcerated people were forced to drink a decoction of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive their stay on the farm.
The nearly 1,000 prisoners were only released due to international pressure.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats the oven - but still pays higher rent
An elderly, stocky man is leaving the client center of the RPG Byty company of &quot;coal baron&quot; Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm is a folder with three new leases for three apartments: for his own apartments and those of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just had their rent increased as part of the so-called &quot;deregulation&quot;.
Instead of renting 3,500 kroner a month, the son will shell out 4,100 kroner next year for a two-room apartment with a kitchen in the second category.
&quot;And there isn&#39;t even hot running water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal stove,&quot; he angrily taps his finger on his son&#39;s new lease, which he has authority to sign.
&quot;But what - I signed it,&quot; he explains, half annoyed and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease terms &quot;incorrect and immoral&quot;, advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when they intend to publish instructions on how to counter such contracts.
But the man just waves it off.
&quot;One says this, the other that,&quot; he scowls.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming a large &quot;deregulation laboratory&quot;.
After the New Year, this deregulation will apply to most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet been paying market rents.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this &quot;laboratory&quot; in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already packed at 9 am this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with her a call device.
&quot;Rent 2011&quot;, a special button lights up on the touchscreen.
Tap it briefly and the device spits out a number slip.
We have barely deciphered the number &quot;157&quot; and it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it&#39;s your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is apparently not about the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes with the new leases will flutter into the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the Ostrava region.
In the letter, RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client center has been open since November 18th.
&quot;The campaign has been running for a little over a week, which means it&#39;s just the beginning,&quot; the women behind the counter reply after a moment&#39;s hesitation when the &quot;client&quot; turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala&#39;s former miners&#39; homes are hot topics.
Before the elections, Ostrava-born parliamentary vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD took up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that the newspapers are full of it today.
&quot;I want a new floor from you for twenty years.&quot;
&quot;They couldn&#39;t even change a damaged toilet seat,&quot; the man mentioned at the beginning vents.
So far, according to the employees, it is mainly pensioners who are queuing at the counter to make sure that they are really getting the promised rent discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in good time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15 should also be able to benefit from a February rent that is reduced by half.
So far, however, the &quot;de-regulation desk&quot; in Havířov has been anything but overwhelmed with inquiries.
&quot;Of yesterday&#39;s 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were here because of the rent in 2011,&quot; estimate the clerks.
RPG offers individual rental agreements both on its websites and on wall boards where it seems necessary.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
&quot;This is not intended to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal course of action,&quot; explains RPG on its website.
&quot;Nobody goes to court here,&quot; says one of the employees at RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center agrees, at least in part.
&quot;I have a pension of 13,000 (kroner), of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court case,&quot; he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
&quot;Let&#39;s see.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and so people are still waiting,&quot; she says.
Regulated rent will end in most of the Czech Republic by New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
&quot;The current level of rent is not even enough to maintain the housing fund,&quot; argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty, and the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the angry tenants is the main reason, according to homeowners the rent increase.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rents received, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in Havířov&#39;s waiting room, a few pieces of information flash in red every now and then.
&quot;Rent increases in 2011 of 15% or less concern 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG&#39;s apartments.&quot;
&quot;This always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month,&quot; reads the LCD monitor.
The rent increases by 38 percent only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio.
&quot;These cases are about raising extremely low rents of CZK 19.66 per square meter,&quot; RPG argues.
With 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation won&#39;t skyrocket rents, but will happen gradually over four and eight years.
What&#39;s more - the company imposes another obligation on itself: all income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and thermal insulation.
But - primarily, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects realized that the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose studios come a number of well-known Brno buildings, counted on the premises for its company mini-kindergarten from the very first drafts for the new Avriopoint building.
With foresight, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is keen to get the designers and architects back to work as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortened working hours, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for the civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding job and childcare.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the Arch.Design employees and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs for their project.
The company mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Program Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and qualified staff and operation will be provided for a period of 2 years.
After the funds have been exhausted (2 years), the Arch.Design company is obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for a further 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the Economy Rating company providing active help in processing the application.
The children are cared for full-time by qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher. Children without age restrictions can attend the kindergarten, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but several children take turns throughout the day.
The day care center is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the day care center - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual upbringing and care, the content of the program in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
The children don&#39;t just play here, but above all they are offered excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to pre-school classes, along with learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator that is available for the children.
What&#39;s more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and this eliminates the stress of late picking up the children from a kindergarten far away.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships develop here.
Arch.Design has thus ranked among Czech companies that offer clear benefits when recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and use such programs to strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are gaping fish mouths.
This is Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi&#39;s Casa Batlló in Barcelona.
The house with its organic shapes was nicknamed &quot;Bone House&quot; by local residents.
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, shards of tile and mosaics, the facades resembling scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi&#39;s Art Nouveau.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that are reminiscent of nature and living beings.
Only on closer inspection does one notice that everything is ruled by geometry, rhythm and well thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade looks even more three-dimensional, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the brilliance of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intricate forms dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and moldings.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district, on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia 43, was created by remodeling a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but ultimately agreed to Gaudí&#39;s idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló apartment building alone.
He worked on it with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created on his drawing board and the use of mosaics on the facade was also his idea.
However, numerous other sculptors and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
Working together on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí&#39;s house Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed &quot;Bone House&quot; by local residents because of its organic shapes.
Others called it the &quot;yawning house&quot; because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of Saint George, patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique for the time, with ventilation ducts and typical chimneys.
Its 45-degree inclination seems a bit bizarre.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all building regulations of the time and was by no means deterred by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified by the result two years later that they demanded help.
Among other things, the councilors objected to the fact that the building even encroached on the public sidewalk with its pillars.
However, no changes were made, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the district&#39;s request for this, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
A staircase runs through the entire six-storey building up to the roof terrace.
The fundamental elements of the renovation eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the saloon doors, allowing a larger company to chat comfortably without sacrificing a certain intimacy in more intimate conversations.
As a result of Gaudí&#39;s reconstruction, the house received not only a new facade, but also a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Gaudí&#39;s play with light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles that line the courtyard and the atriums.
The play of these two colors gives maximum light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners only decided to take this step in 2010 and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
Realizing that this was quite a lucrative business, the visits were maintained and even expanded to include other common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is no small matter, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed frame? Women have different desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - i.e. the mattress and frame make a good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to do justice to the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, height, state of health and last but not least the sex of the sleeper.
The interior is just as important, in which the mattress and frame are subordinate.
Typical example?
In a weekend home that does not have regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited as they take much longer to &quot;warm up&quot;.
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they don&#39;t have enough ventilation ducts in the core and are also lying on a solid surface, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not impossible that mold will form under it.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in your choice.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft surface are common, it will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
&quot;Probably all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here.&quot;
&quot;They simply need a soft layer of visco-foam (memory foam - a shape-memory polymer) for their sore shoulders, heels and hips.&quot;
&quot;I recommend these, among other things, to diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they have difficulty receiving &quot;information&quot; from the joints and skin,&quot; explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That&#39;s why I got these mattresses with visco foam (memory foam) for many ice hockey players and other customers years ago.
&quot;Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others.&quot;
And you don&#39;t have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the advantages of visco foam.
This &quot;miracle&quot; actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the heat absorbed, in other words, it really clings to the warm body.
There&#39;s no pressure anywhere, you don&#39;t roll around at night like you do after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (gangrene).
When choosing the mattress size, you should always add the length of the soles of your feet to your height, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women who are around 180 cm tall need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: &quot;If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for your slightly bent arms,&quot; advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who has been dealing with the problem of the healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and also lectures on this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own frame and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the frames at different heights, and this is by no means possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be the molded layer and the fine upholstery.
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t feel the springs with your hand or when you sit down,&quot; warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of base.
Fully upholstered beds with a mattress and pad like Siamese twins grown together have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be aired and the cover cannot be washed, which is already commonplace these days.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it&#39;s clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a giant (and clogged sieve).
This is one of the reasons why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical piece of advice from retailers: with mattresses that are 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is advisable to use a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Even if nowadays mattress covers are usually manufactured with an all-round zip, so that when you open them you get two halves (hugely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation of larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often seems like an unequal fight between David and Goliath on.
Do they have a solid board in the bed instead of a grate?
Out with it!
Or at most for a bed for unwelcome guests and for a single night.
Even so, you should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there aren&#39;t any in it) and use mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with a so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring slats (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), frames with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more spring slats, with lumbar support in the lumbar area and the possibility of regulating the slat hardness.
Mattresses with a spring skeleton do not belong on adjustable slatted frames, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring slats, which makes it possible to press in the spring slats or even to angle them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in at certain points.
An important thing, especially for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area on &quot;men&#39;s mattresses&quot;.
We also thought of the ladies - they are treated to these soft zones in the hip area.
Point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grids with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion springs are intended for the most demanding customers.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow with the right mattress and the right frame, most of the advantages are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
A 50 x 60 cm cushion, like the ones the Scandinavians like, seems ideal.
When lying on your side, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the frame or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the straw sacks of the past (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word for mattresses is &quot;organic&quot;.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils - for example castor oil and soybean oil - are increasingly being used to produce polyurethane foams.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
&quot;In the case of mattresses, organic means that the core consists of materials of purely natural origin,&quot; explains Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread the scent of fresh forest or lavender while you sleep.
Here, too, a distinction is made between men and women.
While a &quot;cooling&quot; plant extract from birch leaves is used for men so that the mattress cover can absorb heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a &quot;warming&quot; effect.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortably warm while sleeping.
And today&#39;s favourites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with a destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foam and visco foam results in multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to shell out 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to enjoy this advantage.
You can see that it is not so easy to save on the mattress and the frame.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with a memory quilted visco-foam cover for CZK 11,990.
You get the second one for free.
It was the Tempur material that ushered in the era of open-cell, high-density viscoelastic foams at a near-cosmic pace.
No wonder, since they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launch.
Tempur softens when warm, and hardens again in a cool environment.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but also generally increases sleeping comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads that are intended to relieve the legs and blood vessels.
Local manufacturers use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products, for example.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep kids under control
Fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, is just as good at locating people, which would also be helpful in cases like the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a pack of cigarettes, but it will soon be no larger than a wristwatch.
The case of the missing Anička has terrified many people and they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of compromising their privacy.
&quot;We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy happening,&quot; said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the GPS suppliers -tracking devices on the Czech market.
&quot;I admit that there are cases where such devices can be misused, for example if you put it in someone&#39;s pocket without them knowing, but we haven&#39;t had a single case like this.&quot;
&quot;Most customers really buy it for security reasons,&quot; adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what the &quot;box&quot; is for and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn&#39;t like wearing such a thing, they simply get rid of it.
&quot;Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things when they don&#39;t want to be controlled.&quot;
&quot;Already the mobile phones initially aroused great expectations among the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices,&quot; says Ms. Bočková.
In her opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
&quot;In planned kidnappings, the kidnappers almost always check to see if the child has any electronics that could be used to locate them.&quot;
&quot;Today it&#39;s the cell phone.&quot;
&quot;If such surveillance devices found wider use, they would seek them out as well, since their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive publicity.&quot;
&quot;In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,&quot; says the psychologist.
However, she concedes that similar devices can certainly come in handy in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech from RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
&quot;The device can be set up so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals.&quot;
&quot;Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position is available to the affected person.&quot;
&quot;More expensive devices even have an inclinometer built in, which means if you fall and stay motionless, the device immediately sends an alert with your location,&quot; claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also be provided by intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one only needs to import special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices resembling fobs, or smaller cell phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are currently being tested.
&quot;This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
&quot;Or he only notices after a certain time, which gives the police a head start,&quot; he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or tags, the same technology is always used as for vehicle tracking.
In other words, the combination of a location function using the GPS system (just like the navigation system in a car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has enough fuses to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of fuses with which to detonate explosive devices.
The year before, the Department of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of fuse to the army camps.
It&#39;s reassuring to know that the armed forces have made provisions for 225 years.
The only problem is the durability of the fuses - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the fuses from the joint-stock company STV Group, as for a paltry 40 million crowns.
In its justification for purchasing this massive amount of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers used about 60 kilometers of fuse annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians contacted by MF DNES, this statement indicates that the entire army would have to undergo extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers in the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning ladies.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not exempt.
This is the only way to halfway justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of fuses.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies, that two meters of fuse is completely sufficient for the training of every new professional soldier, then with these new purchases the army has a reassuring stock for the already existing ones - also in view of the increased needs of the engineer and special units mentioned 225 years created.
Soldiers from the rapid deployment brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they were almost out of cartridges for handguns, so that target practice is severely restricted due to the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
&quot;I also don&#39;t understand why they buy so many fuses from us.&quot;
But that&#39;s ultimately their decision, they&#39;ll know what they need it for.&quot;
&quot;For us, the army is a good customer that we as a dealer want to accommodate as much as possible,&quot; says Sales Manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fuse by saying that the army would have stocked up on this &quot;ammunition&quot; for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life for the fuses and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
&quot;With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible,&quot; admits one of them, who, however, wishes to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
At the end of its service life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain, they cost additional money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of fuse.
&quot;They cost us 60 percent less than last year&#39;s delivery of 244 kilometers,&quot; spokesman Pejšek tells us about the position of the Defense Ministry&#39;s buyers.
Just for comparison: The annual use of fuses by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police only ever order such quantities of this ammunition that they can use them up before the service life expires.
If only for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, it also keeps open the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also more reliable fuses.
The Ministry of Defense already has huge problems liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the days of the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak People&#39;s Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians contacted by MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces will face the same problem of liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old fuses that they bought so &quot;cheaply&quot; today.
To this day, the contacts I made thanks to the competition still come in handy
Winning the Small Businessman of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec was the winner of last year&#39;s &quot;Small Businessman of the Year&quot; competition.
The story of his success sounds like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only when he was abroad that he realized that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
With the savings from his holiday work abroad and a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated five-apartment house.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester university student at the time, this must have been a brave undertaking.
&quot;The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me, so I tried to do something about it,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of business activity in Liberec he has managed to open four boarding houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel &quot;Pytloun Design Hotel&quot;.
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
&quot;We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other parties interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already contacted us,&quot; says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
&quot;Winning the &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; competition played a large part in this license sale to operate hotels,&quot; adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater notoriety, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
&quot;People recognized me on the street, they often even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that felt really good,&quot; he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don&#39;t need to win right away, any visualization is good.
He says that to this day he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise never have come about.
&quot;I still have regular business relationships with some of the people I met thanks to the competition.&quot;
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is reflected a little on each of his employees.
And since he&#39;s about seventy.
&quot;I notice in them greater loyalty and pride in being part of something that is universally recognized.&quot;
I really don&#39;t see this as just a personal success, no, it&#39;s the result of the good work of all of us.&quot;
&quot;My name just came to the fore,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet is past the worst.
Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet, received the award for first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year.
At the time, the jury recognized the efforts with which he turned the small tool shop in Česká Skalice into a company that generates hundreds of millions in sales.
&quot;I can say that this recognition not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against the competition,&quot; says last year&#39;s winner.
Farmet&#39;s history began with an effort to do something useful.
And when the state then offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop to lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, gave up his career in the company in which he had been employed until then and founded one some of his father&#39;s comrades started their own company for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
&quot;Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand much more intensely, our foreign partners also began to value the fact that they could work with a company that had achieved the greatest possible success in their country,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
However, last year was not just about winning euphoria at Farmet.
The award was based on the company&#39;s financial results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tooling products.
The crisis, which at that time shook companies rather than citizens, was just reaching its climax - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and limit the purchase of new equipment and technologies.
&quot;Of course we couldn&#39;t avoid this situation either.&quot;
&quot;Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and even resort to layoffs,&quot; explains Karel Žďárský
A viable business must sometimes take such unpopular actions.
However, it was possible to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, albeit with lower profits than before the crisis.
One thing the company wasn&#39;t willing to cut back on was its investment in research and development.
&quot;With the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions,&quot; says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
&quot;I wish the new winner lots of joy - but in a calmer atmosphere,&quot; said Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll that does away with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll about the &quot;Absurdity of the Year&quot; is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
It has already been possible to get rid of some nonsensical regulations.
The dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll &quot;Absurdity of the Year&quot; became the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
More than a third of almost four thousand entrepreneurs who cast their votes decided this way.
The social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have called it up with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
&quot;In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer ask for extracts from the commercial register when checking social security payers,&quot; said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the opinion poll &quot;Absurdity of the Year&quot; is to scrutinize all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to abolish the nonsensical ones.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of a business competition organized by the Czech business newspaper (HN) and enjoying increasing public popularity.
If last year around three thousand people took part in the vote, this year there were already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activities.
&quot;In terms of, for example, the number of income tax forms, we rank among the best in the world,&quot; notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, down eight places compared to last year.
The competition absurdity of the year was announced for the first time and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the competition&#39;s editorial deadline at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the &quot;anti-prize&quot; and lets the public vote on the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
For this year&#39;s opinion poll, more than a hundred, or to be more precise, 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been registered.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated &quot;finalists&quot; of the competition are, for example, regulations that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to set up every two years.
The list of this year&#39;s &quot;seven&quot; is published on the competition&#39;s website.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague&#39;s Wenceslas Square is part of a happening in which personalities from political and public life also regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Craftsmen of the Czech Republic. Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic. Republic at the climax of the competition.
&quot;Where the state throws a spanner in the works for entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic growth, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today still unnecessarily complicate business for entrepreneurs,&quot; said Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade with.
Efforts to get rid of nonsensical orders are having an effect.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the Trades Licensing Office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to take a stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was abolished by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation that received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office about business trips by employees of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them, the so-called &quot;green card&quot;.
And - all good things come in threes:
To the absurdity of the year 2009 the ordinance was chosen, which imposed it on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two bathroom scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat relaxed by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement was abolished.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year&#39;s fifth edition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) competition is the category &quot;Responsible Company of the Year 2010&quot;.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
&quot;We would like to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,&quot; says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the crier and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition &quot;Rebell des year&quot; is.
Companies for which success is not the only long-term goal applied for this year&#39;s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and would provide enough material for an article in its own right.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have one common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it is about handicapped people, for example, about personal problems or the health of your own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, was the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of informal sports teams among its employees, who then take part in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of an endowment fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title of &quot;Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region&quot;; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the MiRyz Soft accounting company won, which, among other things, introduced flexible working hours and reduced them to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
When awarding the title, the jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports local citizens&#39; initiatives and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
&quot;We try to recycle as much as possible in order to minimize the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment,&quot; explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, cares about the health of its employees, so it has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, encourages its employees to work from home and uses catering services at company events, provided by a local sheltered workshop.
&quot;We also support the People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community,&quot; says Ondřej Suchý, the company representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company &quot;Praní a čištění&quot; from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees&#39; pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
&quot;We grant our employees contributions for meals, for commuting, to increase their qualifications and for holidays,&quot; says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All district finalists in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition who answered the questions in the enclosed questionnaire and sent it to the organizer by August 15 at the latest were automatically registered for the Responsible Company of the Year category.
Incorrectly or incompletely filled out answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
&quot;If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were disqualified from the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they were not disqualified from the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition.&quot;
&quot;It is not possible to register separately for this competition alone, as it is merely a sub-category of the main Company of the Year competition,&quot; explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison &amp; Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - police arrests in a public tender
In the past few days, the anti-corruption police have been making arrests in the Land Fund building in Pilsen.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away in handcuffs by the detectives.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of restitution claims that was taking place in such a way that the properties offered in the competition went to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
&quot;At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offense of fraudulent activities in a public competition,&quot; Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen prosecutor&#39;s office, told the Právo newspaper not allow investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In view of the scarce official information, one can only speculate as to how he was able to manipulate the public competition.
When asked by Právo, spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomír Černá stated that the police actually made arrests in the Pilsen branch of the Land Fund during a public competition.
&quot;It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees,&quot; she specified.
The public competition, according to Ms. Černá, was correctly called &quot;Invitation to submit claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act&quot; and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the offered land.
&quot;These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the proclaimed property value within the framework of the request.&quot;
&quot;According to the claims offered, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer,&quot; explains the spokeswoman for the fund.
Luboš G. apparently had information available as to who had registered in response to the request and being the entitled person himself having bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously for a fat severance pay.
That would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he was carrying such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had good contacts with the Pilsen land fund in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he handed over plots of land in replacement restitution for which location decisions for building projects had already been made.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, also acquired plots of land from the land fund intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, in the place where the construction of the access highway to the Borské pole industrial zone was planned.
He later exchanged it with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give in with a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots of land.
Household housing costs are increasing by a few hundred every month
From January, households will not only have to reckon with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and sewage fees and for district heating and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more out of their wallets per month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water deliveries and in some places district heating deliveries will also become more expensive.
The rise in electricity prices alone costs households a few hundred crowns more every year.
The high-voltage electricity prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, so the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic systems, is to blame.
Gas will only become more expensive moderately, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Larger towns in particular are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating from January, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1,000 crowns more per year.
In turn, residents of Prague are threatened with 9 percent higher water and sewage charges if the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, for which the so-called rent regulation will no longer apply from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100 percent starting in January.
The company wants to take legal action against those who do not agree with this rent increase.
The regulated rents, which are still being paid in almost 300,000 apartments today, are likely to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk on Fernet and Rum Beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, and for once a good whiskey that was stolen from my father&#39;s bar.
These are the drinks that intoxicated Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen most often require emergency treatment for drinking.
No exception are children who repeatedly have to sleep off their hangover in the hospital.
This follows from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in admissions to children&#39;s departments of clinics.
&quot;Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.&quot;
&quot;Today&#39;s trend is definitely hard alcohol,&quot; said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the children&#39;s department at the Central Bohemian Clinic Hořovice.
&quot;Whisky, if you manage to steal a bottle from your father from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
&quot;Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn&#39;t smell so strong,&quot; explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman for the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees.
&quot;The most common is Fernet or rum.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s the alcohol trend today, especially in elementary schools.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes it was also about slivovitz, which one takes from home,&quot; said Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are by no means exceptional in hospital admissions.
Prior to the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where ambulances brought drunk students from near and far.
&quot;One girl had to be hospitalized four times.&quot;
&quot;She began her career at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood and in combination with &quot;Extase&quot;,&quot; the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
&quot;She was at some dance party at the exhibition center in Holešovice.&quot;
&quot;The interesting thing was that it didn&#39;t seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn&#39;t come home for 48 hours,&quot; says the chief physician.
The lack of interest on the part of the parents or their unbelievable tolerance when toasting with their own offspring is considered to be one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not really dependent on one another in the truest sense of the word.
&quot;Alcoholism is defined as a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all the phenomena associated with it, and that is not the case with these children.&quot;
A negative family and social background is usually characteristic of those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol,&quot; explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman for the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November about forty drunk children were admitted to the local pediatric and adolescent medicine department.
However, only cases of severe alcohol intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are taken home by their parents or the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases when children just drink a bottle of schnapps in the school desk, there are three seasonal amplitudes, according to Mr. Pelikán, which are one hundred percent reliable: Walpurgis Night, New Year&#39;s Eve and the end of the school year.
&quot;The latter for two reasons - either grief over the poor report card or joy of the holidays.&quot;
&quot;On Walpurgis Night I saw seven drunk children in the recording at the same time,&quot; emphasizes Doctor Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to deal with a nasty hangover the next day.
In fact, in the hospital, the morning after headache caused by dehydration and lack of glucose can be relieved with an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
&quot;They are clearly better off, because after the &#39;magnificent&#39; experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood, without anything hurting anywhere.&quot;
&quot;They&#39;re just a little confused about where they are,&quot; admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes at least spoiling the patients&#39; spirits by recounting the cost that the treatment will cost them.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed can easily cost a few tens of thousands of crowns.
&quot;Now and then I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated directly for the children during the rounds what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work the whole vacation to get the money for a single to deserve such parties,&quot; added Doctor Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse to demand the costs necessary to cure drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light attack aircraft out of a total of five exchanged by the Czech Defense Ministry for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen abroad during maneuvers or air shows.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Defense Ministry, it is not yet known when the planes will physically be dispatched from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat fighters, in turn, were withdrawn from long-term stored aircraft without further contributions and investments from the ministry department.
&quot;The two-seat L-159T1s were exchanged in their current condition and appearance,&quot; Pejšek told Právo newspaper.
He added that the Army will not be without two-seat fighter jets since the Defense Ministry signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159s into two-seat versions.
The army took delivery of a new aircraft in July and plans to take delivery of the second by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to getting the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
&quot;The contract clearly states that EADS is the buyer of the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
&quot;It is therefore up to the customer how to do it,&quot; said Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport plane and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by Mirek Topolánek&#39;s government last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defense did not put out a tender for the purchase, but instead approached EADS directly.
The Department of Defense at the time argued that this swap would help future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which they only use 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
Incidentally, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is likely to have legal repercussions.
The European Commission took the Czech Ministry of Defense to the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and certainly not by approaching a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than the ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger appear to have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That&#39;s the surprising finding of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is said to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
&#39;Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test of risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men up to the age of sixty,&#39; said study co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the University of Warwick&#39;s Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely get prostate cancer tested, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family history, Ms Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009 she and her colleagues followed more than 1500 prostate cancer patients in Britain, as well as 3000 healthy men.
The index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger for more than half of the participants in the study.
These men were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, this risk fell by 33 percent in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, and by as much as 87 percent in men up to sixty.
The ratio of the lengths of the two fingers mentioned, which form as early as prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was vaguely aware of this study, but still didn&#39;t think the relationship between finger length and cancer risk was &quot;fully established&quot;.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic was covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly packed snow, the winter service workers were on the move all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to a number of truck and car accidents, and the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague is also &quot;stopped&quot;.
This is what the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Klub (ÚAMK) told Novinky.CZ.
At kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, there were injuries in this accident.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks also collided here.
Drivers should exit just after Brno at 190 km or drive through Brno and exit at 182 km near Kývalka.
There are kilometers of traffic jams.
An accident also happened on the D11, right on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a blanket of snow several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, columns of cars form in the Prosek district, and Štěrboholská Street is also completely congested.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
The Prague crisis management team meets at eight in the morning.
There are also problems with the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travelers should definitely inform themselves about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport is closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are passable only with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three side roads are completely impassable, in the Brno area snowdrifts form in places, and in the Blansko area it is necessary to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will have to be used to clear snow.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be passable again.
Be careful in the area of the White Carpathians in the Hodonín region.
According to ČTK, there is a layer of snow up to five centimeters thick on the roads, which for nature conservation reasons can only be spread with inert grit.
In the Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimeters of fresh snow, mostly in northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters in places.
Up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slowly stopping snowing.
American soldiers have a new &quot;smart weapon&quot;.
American troops have used a new &quot;smart&quot; weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, previously known only by its code designation XM-25.
The generals hope this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and tip the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are guided to the target by a laser with an accuracy of just a few meters.
The special 25mm caliber projectiles developed for this rifle, which contain high-explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to detonate at any point along their ballistic trajectory, not just upon impact with the target.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in a trench.
He is usually not protected from above, so the murderous rain of steel splinters from above can easily incapacitate him.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of &quot;smart&quot; technology.
&quot;Basically what the soldier does is aim at the target and emit a laser beam that determines the distance, thus gaining an accurate sighting point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then all he has to do is pull the trigger.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you measured 543 m.&quot;
&quot;When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
The Fujitsu group relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Strasse in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs for the group, which were previously distributed across the region, should be accommodated there.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park were better suited to the way the employees worked.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The managing director responsible, Bernd Wagner, said, &quot;With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure&quot;.
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of a key company within the region yesterday caused joy among winners and disappointment among losers.
Frankfurt&#39;s head of economic affairs, Markus Frank (CDU), said that a &quot;global player&quot; had once again been won.
This is a &quot;great commitment to the location&quot;.
Fujitsu suits the city, the settlement is an important stimulus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu&#39;s decision.
The city was informed early on by the management about the intention.
&quot;Of course we offered the company our help,&quot; said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties the computer manufacturer had with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have tipped the scales.
The task now is to prevent a long vacancy in such a prominent location.
&quot;I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative.&quot;
Ten years ago, the house on Rathausplatz previously used by Fujitsu and the neighboring &quot;Kleine Verticale&quot; were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the train station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzern describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - is home to the Central Association of the Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry, among other things.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the unveiling platform from its servers.
Political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables may be behind this.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is said to be in Great Britain, according to a newspaper report.
&quot;Wikileaks ousted from Amazon server.&quot;
&quot;Free speech in the land of the free,&quot; said the disclosure activists via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: &quot;Great - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.&quot;
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, &quot;they should stop selling books.&quot;
Amazon stopped WikiLeaks&#39; use of its servers after Senator Joe Lieberman&#39;s staff investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman&#39;s office.
The head of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
&quot;I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given WikiLeaks&#39; previous releases of classified information,&quot; the senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called for the platform to be banned from being used for servers in other countries.
&quot;Wikileaks&#39; illegal, egregious and reckless actions are jeopardizing our national security and endangering lives around the world,&quot; the independent senator said in a statement.
&quot;No responsible company - American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material.&quot;
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is in Great Britain and the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue by his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
&quot;There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange.&quot;
That&#39;s why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was apparently responding to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee has called for those responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - apparently ironically - on television that Assange should &quot;be killed&quot; and that Obama could &quot;use a drone&quot;.
Meanwhile, an exchange of blows broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot; that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for the recently revealed calls for spying on diplomats.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,&quot; Gibbs said.
&quot;Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website.&quot;
The American government is now comprehensively examining the protection of its databases.
The White House announced that Vice Director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures Russell Travers had been appointed as the special representative.
Travers is responsible for developing &quot;necessary structural reforms&quot; that became necessary after WikiLeaks disclosed the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government shares and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
&quot;We have made every effort to get in touch with them,&quot; said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
&quot;We stand ready to protect them should the need arise.&quot;
The Ice University
At the &quot;Gelato University&quot; near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of participants and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German somewhat archaic the ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, spreads it into the cone and then sells it.
You don&#39;t have to go to Anzola dell&#39;Emilia, in the province of Bologna, to know this.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can&#39;t avoid the &quot;Gelato University&quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice Cream University was set up by the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines would live up to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of visitors and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some people dream of a new career during their mid-life crisis, while others simply venture onto the slippery slope of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the future in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and, after years in a nerve-wracking job, wants to bag something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelato Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is decisive, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
During his training, Luciano doesn&#39;t forget the icing on the cake of the national and Mediterranean superstructure: &quot;Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there&#39;s a lot of romance involved.&quot;
The first step in making it seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cool it down to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
The lecturer was immediately besieged with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire to experiment run free?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream &quot;made only from natural ingredients&quot; may have used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will bite on nothing but grains of ice cream.
Certain variations on the base are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
&quot;The suppliers will all try to sell you dozens of flavored supplements.&quot;
&quot;But you should just experiment.&quot;
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the course participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano has them create four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural additives.
The fruit ice cream varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - it&#39;s not necessarily better in terms of taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group, which uses more fruit, less water, and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix really brings out the flavor of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is a math problem: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit (winegrowers use it to measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, spreadsheets make the math easier.
Making ice cream doesn&#39;t require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures at the same time.
Despite all the automation, small glitches are inevitable.
Brazilian Gustavo is covering himself and his classmates in fruit puree when his oversized hand blender goes out of control.
&quot;In any course,&quot; says Maestro Luciano, &quot;it&#39;s only a matter of time before something like this happens.&quot;
controllers in the twilight
The European food authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now formulating this accusation.
&quot;It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,&quot; said Testbiotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has played a key role in the Efsa test regulations for genetically modified plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The Efsa regulations are paragraphs identical to Ilsi position papers and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is actually supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech has complained about a conflict of interests.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager recently joined the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or a transitional period - and thus switched sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authority and the industry lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency and EU parliamentarians prick up their ears.
However, EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
According to a statement, all reputable data are used, including those from the industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
The experts who work for Efsa are not expected to have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the US.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In this regard, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently being approved without any animal feeding trials and that the reaction of genetically engineered plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
&quot;We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in the field,&quot; says Then.
The current practice is to only test isolated proteins and not the whole genetically modified plant, which does not provide reliable results.
&quot;If you don&#39;t look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?&quot; Then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way too.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this field, as in the USA, industry in Europe is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not linked to corporations.
Studies that are critical for companies are usually not published.
&quot;Industry controls security research,&quot; claims Hilbeck.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell got some too, a total of around 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
it was demo
It snowed.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators arrived and began demolishing a large section of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against the S21, the billion-euro lowering of the station.
When construction came to a halt, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shell limestone, a soft, coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He&#39;s secured a few of the chunks.
&quot;These stones are relics.&quot;
&quot;You mustn&#39;t go away.&quot;
He enthuses: &quot;A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy.&quot;
When he sawed one open, it smelled of cigarette smoke.
He doesn&#39;t yet know what he&#39;ll do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades in old stones.
He bought everything that came up during the demolition in Stuttgart.
&quot;It would be a shame if they were ground up into gravel or ended up in the landfill,&quot; he says in his office, a wooden booth that was once a sentry box.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought what was left of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn&#39;t do anything about the demolition.
And if it does happen, then it would be the most sensible thing for the stones to be reused.
Around 200 opponents of the S-21 then took one of the cuboids, which weighed an average of 80 kilos and cost 6.50 to 14 euros each.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to return it when it is rebuilt.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from everywhere and hauled away whatever trunk and trailer could carry.
The stumbling blocks in Stuttgart have long since been transformed into &quot;walls&quot; or the borders of herb beds.
&quot;Actually, this stone is nothing special,&quot; says Rongen.
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t be the political component.&quot;
He climbs into his SUV and takes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then he became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40,000 tons of stones.
He carts his treasures together from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest old stone dealer in the republic.
He brakes.
Artfully carved sandstones lie in the snow.
&quot;They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden,&quot; he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
&quot;My favorite stone.&quot;
It goes up the path through the forest.
He points to a heap: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station.
And further.
&quot;Nice travertine.&quot;
The cuboids once belonged to the stands of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Sankt Blasien cathedral, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hand-hewn and moved with simple pulleys and ox-carts, he becomes quite awestruck.
&quot;It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that.&quot;
He didn&#39;t get rich, certainly not filthy rich.
But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have also settled up in the forest.
&quot;We work hard, but it&#39;s satisfying,&quot; says the recycler.
He has to go to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved there too.
Talent battle for high potential
There is a great rush at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are supposed to talk shop with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen at the same time.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls, before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And because the universities don&#39;t publish any lists of their students&#39; achievements, they try to spot and retain exceptional talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is courting the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department hands out pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: &quot;The students make contact with industry and gain experience.&quot;
&quot;VW can simultaneously get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who might be suitable employees.&quot;
According to Selle, such cooperations are not unusual.
What is new is that the students are courted so aggressively.
&quot;Otherwise the focus was more on the technical project,&quot; says Selle.
The fight for the freshly graduated will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large crowd of applicants.
Instead, they have to advertise themselves and court courtship, especially for highly qualified workers.
Engineering graduates in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineer gap will become even larger.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
He organizes complex recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company intends to send eight promising students across the United States over the next year.
At the same time, participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to participate is decided in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants fly to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when it comes to fighting for high potentials at universities.
&quot;We want to stand out from the crowd with the race.&quot;
&quot;Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us.&quot;
For talent hunter Dykta, the calculation seems to be working out.
&quot;We are still in contact with everyone who took part in a similar campaign last year.&quot;
&quot;Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon,&quot; he says.
In addition to courting directly on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular go on the prowl at careers fairs in the classic way.
&quot;We try to reach graduates at trade fairs.&quot;
&quot;For example at the Intersolar&quot;, reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Human Resources at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 positions advertised on the company website.
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult to fill vacancies right now.&quot;
&quot;It takes a lot of time and money,&quot; she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
&quot;The professors give advice that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis.&quot;
Expensive advertising campaigns are not popular with solar specialists.
The company tries to advertise itself with other advantages: a personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
&quot;A large corporation often can&#39;t offer that,&quot; says Head of Human Resources Stübe.
Money is no longer the main factor when looking for a job.
Flexible working hours, childcare and good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the general conditions for the employees.
Head of Human Resources Stübe hopes that the placement will also give the job seekers a plus point.
&quot;I think applicants look particularly for external reviews about a potential employer,&quot; she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, primarily internal measures.
&quot;The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,&quot; he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within your own workforce.
&quot;Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.&quot;
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would all of their own accord advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
&quot;It&#39;s like playing with a gang,&quot; says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thus finally revoked its earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; drilling platform in April.
Before the accident, which claimed the lives of eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the United States&#39; dependency on oil supplies from abroad.
It has not yet been conclusively clarified who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is being confronted with demands in the billions.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze imposed after the blast.
Various oil companies then immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe with stricter controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible control authority, which fell into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
&quot;The government&#39;s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry,&quot; is the result of a current industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: &quot;Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation.&quot;
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria&#39;s Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
&quot;Don&#39;t toil,&quot; the eco-activist reassured the journalists: &quot;You&#39;ll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today.&quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian followed an attempt to photograph a boy wading chest-deep in water with the streaks surrounding him: the scene looks almost pretty in the rainbow-colored water sheen.
There is no sign of brown plumes of crude oil floating beneath the surface.
She used to collect buckets of shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggishly flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil spilled out of a burst pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to reach waters that contain fish: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
Driving through the mangrove swamps, which are criss-crossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown liquid, and anyone who dips their hand in the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black liquorice sticks, and the occasional palm tree sadly hangs its fronds.
One looks in vain for flocks of birds, which are otherwise common in wetlands: as soon as the outboard engine is silent, an eerie calm spreads in the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
&quot;What is happening here is ecological warfare,&quot; says Celestine Akpobari darkly. &quot;We live in constant danger to our health.&quot;
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni has been a battlefield that has been fought over for decades: This is where the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, this is where the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, this is where the Shell -Group ceased production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still prevented from returning to Ogoniland today: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped out of the entire delta region, which is three times the size of Switzerland with more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland lie idle The company&#39;s situation is unstable.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude out of the water like bizarre sculptures: the heads of the boreholes are far too affectionately called &quot;Christmas trees&quot;.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the core.
Such a drill head keeps breaking apart, says Akpobari, and a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the ecosystem of the delta in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that penetrated into the sea off Alaska when the supertanker &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; crashed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the world Human history.
There is a dispute about who is responsible for the ongoing ecological meltdown.
While the Shell company blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In 2008, US scientist Richard Steiner accused Shell of having much lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usual elsewhere in the world: the rate of defects in the lines alone is &quot;many times higher than elsewhere.&quot;
In what looks from afar like an abandoned, oil-smeared open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: stark naked and covered in oil up to their necks.
A fire flickers under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to pipes, some of which are scattered randomly around the site: an illegal small-scale refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the catch pot, later kerosene and finally diesel trickle out at the end of the pipe.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300 liter barrels of diesel every day: &quot;That earns us 34,000 naira&quot; - around 22 dollars.
The delta dwellers take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal stoves can even undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel at just under 40 euro cents per liter: Because they get their raw material for free.
According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil every day in this way throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the temporarily stored raw material is processed illegally: organized criminal networks, which are said to include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion&#39;s share in tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the activities of the population or the lax production methods to be purely academic.
&quot;If the oil companies weren&#39;t perceived as invaders and if they hadn&#39;t so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries.&quot;
In the meantime, however, the relationship between the Ogoni and Shell in particular has been so badly damaged that the only option is for the group to withdraw: &quot;Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will turn out to be better.&quot;
That&#39;s when Michael gets nervous.
&quot;It&#39;s high time you disappeared,&quot; says the muscular oilman.
&quot;The soldiers can come any minute.&quot;
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not face arrest, but they do face a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who primarily come from the north of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material.
&quot;This damn stuff has turned our country upside down in every way,&quot; says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous design flaws in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major safety issue.
While examining an emergency-landed machine, investigators have discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to a &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot;.
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November were apparently much luckier than previously known: the Australian aviation security authority has found a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connection, according to a statement by the ATSB authority published on Thursday.
This could have resulted in &quot;a catastrophic engine failure&quot;.
Engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series are affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus that had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of claim in an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
When the engine caught fire, parts had come loose and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide now have to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue had been deemed of sufficient importance to inform all concerned.
The airline grounded its A380 fleet for weeks after the emergency landing of the Qantas plane.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
Chaos reigns on many streets, trains and flights are cancelled.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there is sometimes 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
Winter service was in constant use on the A7 near Flensburg, but could not cope with the constantly new snow blowing up.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, the snowdrifts on the autobahns and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the storm center Meteomedia, the alarm level purple was announced in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
In some cases, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars got stuck there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to slow traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and points.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
An ICE to Munich had to stop in Saalfeld, Thuringia.
The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been canceled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 camp beds ready for them.
There were already accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was hit on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: The snow will still be loose and powdery and will therefore whirl up even with light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - in places down to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters look pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt&#39;s banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed to go back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the costs for the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
&quot;We always check whether it makes more sense to own real estate or to sell it and then rent it back,&quot; he said.
This means that Germany&#39;s largest bank is giving up its company headquarters after a short time.
The bank took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from investors in an in-house fund and then extensively renovated them.
According to the information, the energetic conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed &quot;Greentowers&quot;, at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead buddies
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have commemorated the trapped miners who were pronounced dead after multiple explosions at a mine.
The bodies have still not been recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft remains precarious.
Almost two weeks ago there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but found no sign of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue workers could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the miners.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth on New Zealand&#39;s South Island in bright sunshine.
They were silent for two minutes.
Twenty-nine tables were set up in honor of the buried miners, with helmets, lamps and the names of miners on them.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast in front of the country&#39;s government buildings.
New Zealand&#39;s Prime Minister John Key told those attending the commemoration that New Zealand had hoped that the miners &quot;from the depths of the earth&quot; would come back to the surface.
&quot;But they never came home.&quot;
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit, said he couldn&#39;t wrap up his son&#39;s death until he saw his body.
In addition to the prime minister and the victims&#39; relatives, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration ceremony.
Miners of British and South African descent were also buried in the first explosion on November 19.
Rescue workers began putting out a fire inside a coal mine in New Zealand&#39;s South Island.
Police Commissioner Gary Knowles told journalists that once the explosive gases were displaced, work would begin to cool down the blistering temperatures inside the mine.
Hell warrior!
Does splatter go with art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn rediscovers old genre boundaries with his fighter epic &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;.
What kind of audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when filming &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;?
A captive Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in droves with almost superhuman strength - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use ruthless methods of killing served and sometimes ripped the intestines out of his enemies when he was in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eye, as he is actually called, doesn&#39;t say a word throughout the film, and the other characters only let themselves be carried away by a sentence or two or a few agonized death screams at most.
Otherwise there is silence and revel in the creepily beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult film buffs with an interest in existentialism and very calm tracking shots.
It&#39;s nice when a film has several target groups, it&#39;s just a shame when they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy &quot;Pusher&quot;, director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or to the art house with a little less brutality.
Most art cinema fans should be put off by the splashing brain matter and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, One-Eye sets off with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck in doldrums and fog for an eternity before the team apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
So it&#39;s no wonder that &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; didn&#39;t find a cinema distributor in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
That&#39;s a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-soaked facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film isn&#39;t about dialogue or a stringent plot, it&#39;s all atmosphere, a fever dream made into a film.
And from that there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly constricts his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that beats at him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, loyal to One-Eye, retains anything resembling innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means doom, but perhaps only for those who are already doomed.
&quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; is an enigmatic film to hate and admire, to vex, excite and marvel at.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - it still allows controls.
Around midnight September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attack a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria is said to have built with help from North Korea in the ashlar, hidden in a valley branching off the river.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA ran a video presentation with blurred satellite imagery.
Using computer animation, she showed where which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also submitted photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was about to be commissioned, it said, but had not yet been fitted with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, and the mysteries have only gotten bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, prior to the attack, the CIA was fairly certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that the country was &quot; an active nuclear weapons program&quot;.
Some secret service agents in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an &quot;alleged reactor&quot;, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be &quot;plausible&quot;.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how sure he was that he had a reactor in front of him, a high-ranking UN diplomat answered succinctly in the summer that the IAEA had &quot;enough material to ask questions.&quot;
The Syrians hurriedly cleared away the rubble from the alleged &quot;unused military building&quot; and thoroughly leveled the site.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite imagery from commercial providers in the immediate aftermath of the attack through one member state, which may be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - just like it did about the satellite images.
It also denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
But Israel is also staunchly silent.
&quot;We will never comment on that,&quot; Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
The investigation into the case has been dragging on since June 2008 without any results and &quot;is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority,&quot; as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna concedes - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA watches over.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are said to be &quot;in functional connection&quot; with the alleged reactor - and, unlike this, still exist, as the key to progress in reconnaissance.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which systems are involved, what their function is, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or adjacent to a military base -- and that&#39;s exactly why Syria denies the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the USA to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives became aware of the facilities through a tip from the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the Euphrates cuboid.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be &quot;related to fuel production&quot;.
But there are &quot;no indications of sensitive activities&quot;, i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was later to be separated from it, there are at best plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable evidence was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one wants to know where the rubble went.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 to be suitable as a repository for radioactive waste, to be unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review.
But footage from orbit shows Syria carrying out earthworks and removing large containers at the three suspect locations after the IAEA requested access.
That may be coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to protect any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
A year ago, Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter was not of great urgency Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of &quot;an option that I am open to in the future,&quot; but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
Second, as one diplomat points out, &quot;What if they end up not finding anything?&quot;
Love in times of war
There has been trouble since Angelina Jolie started work on her unnamed directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Not much more is known about it - but that alone is enough to cause unrest.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women&#39;s associations protested immediately, which prompted some days of shooting planned in Sarajevo to be relocated to Hungary at short notice.
The film has now been shot and is in post-production in Hungary, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador for the UN refugee agency.
She&#39;s not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they turned it down.
According to Hasecic, the meeting must take place in Bosnia.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie&#39;s attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be fired as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
After some back and forth, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her screenplay to read, gave permission to film in Sarajevo - it&#39;s not entirely clear why Jolie still didn&#39;t come.
The young author herself affirms that she has no political intentions with her film, that she has worked hard to familiarize herself with the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all parties involved a voice.
However, she remains vague about the content.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating online, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war broke out and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is kidnapped in a Serbian camp where he is a guard is working.
Which sounds a lot different than the variant &quot;rape victim falls in love with torturer&quot;.
That Jolie&#39;s film actually begins before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was &quot;unfair and based on misinformation.&quot;
Now only Hollywood hackers can bring her peace: by illegally posting the script, like so many before, on the Internet.
Let&#39;s get out of here
This evening, things are finally going really well again for the Irish.
Not a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates their guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much for that.
The fans hoot with joy to the loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, trembles because the players throw table tennis balls three meters into beer mugs - and hit them.
The bizarre spectacle is called &quot;beer pong&quot; and there is a prize of 500 euros plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist don&#39;t really go together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, to distract himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His plan isn&#39;t to have fun in Las Vegas, he&#39;ll be interviewing in New Zealand in January.
&quot;I have a queasy feeling about it,&quot; he says.
&quot;It&#39;s so far from home and I don&#39;t have a job there yet.&quot;
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - &quot;she had her dream job as an event manager in no time, maybe a good sign,&quot; says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner&#39;s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: It&#39;s like the Tanners in many families on the island.
Experts at the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict that 100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future.
They even expect 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
A heavy loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts come true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is once again spreading.
The economic crisis unsettles the young, well-educated Irish people in particular, for whom things have only been going uphill so far.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times abounds with letters to the editor from young expats complaining: &quot;Everything is going down the drain in Ireland.&quot;
&quot;There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but those who can leave and our country loses a whole generation.&quot;
&quot;The last one please turn off the light.&quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future ahead because the government is just window dressing and offering young people no future prospects.
&quot;They are reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs,&quot; says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest worry, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
&quot;That thought is sad and depressing.&quot;
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to cast a positive light on the topic.
McLarnon organizes &quot;WorkingAbroadExpo&quot;, an exhibition that offers a full service on the subject of working abroad.
&quot;For job starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps up the career ladder,&quot; says the manager.
Photos on his website show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not galley service, it also brings freedom and fun.
For six months, Seán O&#39;Donovan has known how it feels to build something up somewhere else.
Because there was nothing more for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently building a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O&#39;Donovan rarely sees his home country these days, working extra shifts to pay off the loan on his house back home.
&quot;The situation is a bit crazy,&quot; he says, stepping over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
&quot;I&#39;m earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I hardly ever stay in anymore.&quot;
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cold rooms.
The small house is in a fine residential area with well-tended front gardens, and large, expensive cars are parked in the driveways.
Together with a sister, O&#39;Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent debt-financed.
&quot;They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions,&quot; he says.
Is he afraid that the loan could go wrong?
O&#39;Donovan thinks for a while, then pours more hot tea and says, &quot;I don&#39;t have any kids to feed and I&#39;m young; even if things go wrong, I can start over.&quot;
The civil engineer doesn&#39;t like the wailing he hears a lot these days.
&quot;Nobody has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as it used to be here on the island,&quot; he says.
&quot;Working abroad for a while isn&#39;t the worst thing that can happen - maybe that&#39;s what makes us feel Irish.&quot;
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
&quot;After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, simple as that.&quot;
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how things are going with life somewhere else.
He already has a few years of work in London behind him and why shouldn&#39;t things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is still one thing that worries him a lot these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
&quot;Just don&#39;t get too emotional,&quot; he says, taking a long gulp of his beer.
&quot;Goodbye, that sounds scary.&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s call it a walk away party, easygoing, with some friends, some drinks, some games.&quot;
The democratic routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is support for private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil&#39;s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the findings of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts stand out in this year&#39;s survey from September and October.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
and second, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In numerous countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown rapidly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at around 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since last year&#39;s sharp slump.
Yet only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region&#39;s most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country&#39;s democratic practice. That is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% trust their country&#39;s Congress and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America&#39;s economic crises undermined democratic efforts.
The fact that this continued during the global economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America only experienced a short recession phase and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were cushioned by a stronger social safety net.
(The poverty rate in Latin America rose only modestly in 2009, and has fallen 32% this year, according to reports this week from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America.)
However, there are strong differences in sentiment from country to country (see Diagram 4).
Brazil&#39;s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread progressive mentality.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crime has increased.
For only the second time since the survey began, many Latin American respondents see crime as a bigger problem in their country than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say either they or a family member have been a victim of a crime in the past year. However, levels have fallen from 38% last year, to their lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: approx. 71% of those surveyed nationwide stated that the private economy is indispensable for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Diagram 6).
About 58% said only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of private enterprise), despite the fact that their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is nationalizing many private companies.
Brazil has the greatest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, see the United States as the most influential country, with Venezuela assuming this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An election defeat
No one expected the November 28 elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of poll workers who rushed to help the troubled country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, vandalized polling stations and intimidation were just part of the problem.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were displaced by January&#39;s earthquake, roamed the countryside looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected frontrunners, have called for the election results to be overturned over alleged fraud.
Protests, some of them violent, broke out across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as &quot;quite good in many respects&quot;.
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, &quot;these irregularities, serious as they are, do not necessarily invalidate the process.&quot;
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is said to be indebted to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his nominee, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected runoff election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidation action.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support from the electorate, is declared the winner of the runoff by the electoral authorities, problems could arise.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election had not yet been distributed.
The stakes are high.
Donor countries see legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti&#39;s reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following her husband&#39;s sudden death, Argentina&#39;s President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a surge of sympathy that boosted her popularity rating by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest since she was elected in 2007.
However, whether this will get her re-elected next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to steer economic policy even after his wife was elected, often drew up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue as they saw fit.
On paper, the Fernández administration lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner&#39;s death from a heart attack on October 27 led to further rifts.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists backed Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (with one MP slapping another in the face and others accusing the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
&quot;I will not discuss it,&quot; said the President.
The 2010 budget now carries over into next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend as she pleases.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and union wage claims - are pushing the figure to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was rocked by economic crises, said his main goals were growth and poverty reduction, not lowering inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullied the private sector and purged the National Institute for Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently whitewashed the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She has called on the private sector and union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be capped at 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina&#39;s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt with a major devaluation in 2002.
Possibly for this reason Cristina Fernández would like to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year the government struck a deal with security holders who had opposed the country&#39;s earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández appears to be pushing for a deal with Paris Club lenders to whom she owes approximately $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused an IMF review, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide &quot;technical assistance&quot; in compiling a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step in cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, most of whom are fed up with Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy she received will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she must choose between quietly overturning many of her husband&#39;s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan&#39;s voters are slowly moving towards closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the straits?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, turned out to elect mayors and councilors in the five boroughs. This is taken as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Having developed pioneering business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma has become a symbol of mainland relations himself. His policies changed relations with mainland China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) provided three of the five mayors, it did not get a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party&#39;s share of the vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual incidents in Taiwan such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass processions and scantily clad dancers took place.
There was even the obligatory mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election for a KMT candidate,
when a man in the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander killed.
Bizarrely, it&#39;s not clear if the shooter was trying to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the DPP, the attack marred the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
China may have been the campaign&#39;s biggest winner.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated public housing plans and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their virtual independence and reject China&#39;s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to prioritize its relations with the Beijing government.
This time, however, the DPP also avoided stoking anti-Chinese sentiment too much.
She was reacting to the new awareness that Taiwan&#39;s economy cannot survive without China.
For his part, Ma wants confirmation that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants political integration. But first things first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai&#39;s reign, a new generation of moderate politicians has emerged and the DPP is fighting for the votes of professionals and youth.
Tsai was well received as the DPP&#39;s presidential candidate, as was Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it, too, is capable of building close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a &quot;trustworthy alternative&quot; to Ma&#39;s hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this move.
From his cell, he said the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan&#39;s independence.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to give up the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen&#39;s interference, the DPP is struggling to choose its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma&#39;s scores are poor despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will reorganize his cabinet and local institutions.
The strong stance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan&#39;s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, &quot;there is already no turning back&quot;.
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you perform at the request of a president, people will take notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has surprisingly been nominated for this year&#39;s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her 2008 album Esperanza, the nomination seems a bit unusual. But it conforms to Grammy rules, according to which an artist can only have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album that made them known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album Chamber Music Society is certainly a step forward. And with her lilting voice and keen flair for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose huge success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category comes closest to Spalding&#39;s nomination.
The album &quot;Historicity&quot; by the Vijay Iyer Trio was also nominated in the instrumental albums category. This made this critics&#39; darling a smash hit.
Iyer&#39;s contenders include veteran saxophonist James Moody&#39;s &quot;Moody 4B&quot; and keyboardist John Beasley&#39;s &quot;Positootly&quot;.
Trombone Shorty, a tough New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO&#39;s &quot;Treme,&quot; was recognized in the contemporary jazz category, which tends to feature albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue&#39;s Secret Societ received well-deserved attention in the Large Group category. He goes up against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life album &quot;Pathways&quot; is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in Classic categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Topping the list are Michael Daugherty&#39;s &quot;Deux Ex Machina&quot; for piano and orchestra in five voices, and Steve Mackey&#39;s &quot;Dreamhouse&quot;, an eclectic orchestral work in three voices.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 &quot;Los Angeles&quot;. This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
LA-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories ranging from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated in the Classical Producers category this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner&#39;s Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty&#39;s &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Symphony&quot; performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey&#39;s &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; &quot;Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati&quot; performed by various artists; and Verdi&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg&#39;s &quot;Lulu&quot; by the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse&#39;s &quot;Marc Antonio e Cleopatra&quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho&#39;s &quot;L&#39;Amour de Loin&quot; by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin&#39;s &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; by the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra and Chorus; and Arthur Sullivan&#39;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot;, Hans Werner Henze for &quot;Appassionatamente Plus&quot;, Magnus Lindberg for &quot;Graffiti&quot; and Shchedrin for &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the LA Philharmonic conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is entitled &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman&#39;s &quot;Mondolin Concerto&quot; received a nomination in the Instrumental Solo with Orchestra category.
The LA composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with New York&#39;s Metropolis Ensemble.
&quot;I used sounds from the Middle East and a lot of North African tones and rhythms,&quot; Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestral Performance category for a recording of Stravinsky&#39;s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivicagenaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
Soprano Jessye Norman was nominated in the Classical Crossover category for her recording &quot;Roots - My Life, My Song&quot;.
Mosque in Temecula wins planning committee approval
The construction of a mosque in Temecula received unanimous approval from the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated, public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will be an aesthetic eye-catcher.
&quot;The project has the support of many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha&#39;is, and many others,&quot; said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center Thursday morning.
&quot;As an American, that makes me proud.&quot;
&quot;It shows that justice prevails.&quot;
&quot;There are few opponents,&quot; he added.
&quot;You&#39;re just very loud.&quot;
&quot;Wonderful people live in this valley.&quot;
The session started at 6:00 p.m. and discussions for and against building the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes split fairly evenly on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper&#39;s website.
&quot;There is no more America,&quot; read one comment.
&quot;It&#39;s another planet of the apes and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand.&quot;
&quot;America is finished.&quot;
Planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the scene of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wished for a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented with a water filtration equipment manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque will have two minarets and be around 13 m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 site on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously thought essential to life.
&quot;This organism has two options.&quot;
&quot;It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow.&quot;
&quot;That makes it very special, even though it&#39;s almost a kind of &#39;alien&#39; life form,&quot; said Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in Thursday&#39;s online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered essential to life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake, California, continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
&quot;It makes you wonder what else is possible,&quot; said report co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study looks at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference that did not provide details of the discovery sparked widespread speculation online that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery &quot;shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can use other elements to initiate biochemical processes, and that the &#39;standard elements&#39; that we believe are absolutely necessary for life are not necessarily fixed,&quot; said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
&#39;This work is first because it shows that one element can be substituted for another in fundamental biochemical processes and structures,&#39; added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA&#39;s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she hypothesized that exposure to both microbes might be able to substitute one element for the other.
&quot;The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically in a similar way to phosphorus.&quot;
&quot;This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another.&quot;
&quot;But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it basically smears everything,&quot; explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, its ability to survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life-form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more abundant.
According to Jamie S. Foster, associate professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that arsenic can be substituted for phosphorus is not new. But so far there hasn&#39;t been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so scientists have assumed that early life forms used it.
&quot;This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early geological era,&quot; said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon&#39;s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Remaining stolen show dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from outside a Bellflower motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff said Thursday.
The four show dogs -- two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis -- disappeared Tuesday when strangers stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were being housed outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were spotted Wednesday afternoon, and the final two were spotted Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department.
&quot;The good news is the dogs are doing well,&quot; said Whitmore.
&quot;They are in good condition.&quot;
&quot;They have been returned to their rightful owners.&quot;
Whitmore did not provide specific information about the location of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
&quot;The investigation is still ongoing.&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t want to say more about that,&quot; explains Whitmore.
&quot;We&#39;re following some leads.&quot;
The dog&#39;s owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information Thursday.
They received their two dogs at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff&#39;s officials found the van and the two dogs in separate locations in Compton.
The Akitas -- Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female -- were unharmed, officials said.
But the corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where Trace was scheduled to compete.
As Peek told the Times Wednesday, the other dogs were scheduled to compete in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple&#39;s nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs -- a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany -- to their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window ajar so the dogs could get some fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder&#39;s fee to anyone who could provide information about the corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet clear whether a finder&#39;s fee would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially approved the &quot;prepared&quot; lender plan to pay down $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new movies and TV shows.
According to statements made Thursday, the plan complies with US bankruptcy law requirements, leaving nothing standing in the way of MGM&#39;s restart under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will lead the somewhat slimmed-down studio as general managers.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to around 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase completes a proposed $500 million bond issue to fund new MGM productions.
The company is currently managed by a consortium of the investment bank, which itself has brought in $75 million. Funding is expected to be in place by mid-December.
The studio&#39;s restructuring began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis &amp; Co was hired to help management, which was struggling with $300m/year in interest payments, solve its financial woes.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and restructuring expert best known for his work at Krispy Kreme Donuts.
Moelis &amp; Cooper&#39;s efforts to resolve MGM&#39;s financial woes and pay off the studio&#39;s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided in late 2009 to put the company up for sale.
But the auction attracted few bidders and none were willing to pay the $2 billion demanded by creditors.
It all started all over again in the spring of this year when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which, after months of debate and internal disputes, was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multimillion-dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis &amp; Co., who have already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who were paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a $4 million &quot;success bonus.&quot;
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restart production at MGM. The studio released just one film this year and has a yearly plan of seven or eight films due for release in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial interest in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded approximately 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year&#39;s favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both of these gimmicks can make a significant dent in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX bikes for $99, while a Kinect game costs about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can go easy on your gift budget.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and a BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club, in search of three electronic toys under $80.
It was immediately clear to me that Moore&#39;s Law was in effect. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And while fewer new toys are appearing with their own websites, the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a broader range.
Coin cell powered toys are becoming more popular and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise noted, all prices are from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, ages 3+) are plush figures the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when you press their tummy.
One press corresponds to a note, repeated presses play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start squeezing, you can&#39;t stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for ages 2+) is your best bet.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay like &#39;Simon Says&#39;, and thanks to the innovative hinged feet with wheel locks, it masters the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you&#39;re an 80&#39;s kid, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he&#39;s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, ages 3+) with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with an autocorrect know-it-all teacher.
If you don&#39;t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech&#39;s MobiGo ($60 for kids 3-8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games it contains aren&#39;t as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for ages 3-12), which features a new, brighter screen following Leapfrog&#39;s first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
Neither version is compatible with older cartridges.
Fisher-Price&#39;s iXL ($90 for kids 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system for the games and e-books, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there&#39;s Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for ages 8+). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about matching the blocks into words before time runs out. It&#39;s great for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Judging by toy store offerings alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to gift your child an online Club Penguin animal, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2&quot; Mix &#39;N Match Figure Pack ($5 for ages 6-12) that includes a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
This can be roller skates or a Puffle stuffed animal.
The newest head-cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for ages 5 and up), is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly in any direction on 12 vibrating silicone legs.
Sending him through a maze of blocks is fun.
And he can take a beating.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived in our dog&#39;s mouth for a while.
Police operations in China are becoming gentler
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin strode through a city square, checking on his nervous subordinates while issuing orders with military authority and a low voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China&#39;s hardy guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their random crackdowns and penchant for violence - to impress viewers.
&quot;Stand up straight!&quot;
&quot;Look straight ahead!&quot;
&quot;Show them,&quot; he whispered to them, &quot;how pretty girls are!&quot;
Four girls, barely past their teens, wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood at attention.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held up with blue and white striped bows.
&quot;They look average to me,&quot; Mr. Tang remarks disparagingly.
&quot;Models are pretty.&quot;
Several governments have tried to polish the image of China&#39;s city inspectors.
In one city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced violence with stares: in 2009, 50 officers reportedly circled an improperly set up food truck and stared at the operator, who half an hour later packed up and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, would like to fundamentally change its image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the municipal police patrols. They were specifically chosen for their looks, good shape and youth.
They are intended to give the rough-hewn police force a softer, more feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the poor image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, say the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers may enforce city laws only through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely paints a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a bystander to death after he filmed them on his cell phone crushing a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual from Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how offenders can be beaten up without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon vendor suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officers.
A violent video game downloadable from the Internet shows Chinese-trained officers attacking street vendors.
&quot;Chengguan scares the government,&quot; the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, following further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a &quot;really thorough cleanup.&quot;
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
In October, when the district advertised for eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real jobs or were just a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and &quot;harmonious facial features&quot; were wanted.
They should be above average height - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when the employee reaches the age of 26.
According to officials, the job is too physically demanding for women over 25.
&quot;The most important thing is their image,&quot; an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
&quot;Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their physical appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.&quot;
Then come temperament and &quot;inner qualities&quot;.
&quot;Female chengguan are like flower vases,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;but beyond that, they have other duties.&quot;
Zheng Lihua, deputy chief of the district municipal government, does not agree with this description,
admitted, however, that size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon in China.
The same goes for even facial features.
Whether that equates to good looks is a matter of debate in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
&quot;Unfortunately, we don&#39;t need lame people or hunchbacks here,&quot; said Mr. Zheng.
&quot;Your image would not be good.&quot;
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a shapely mouth.
She didn&#39;t find it sexist that so much emphasis was placed on her appearance.
&quot;Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?&quot; she asks with an ironic look.
Her dimpled colleague, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, &quot;Our job is to represent the city&#39;s image.&quot;
According to them, they have no regrets about the brief hiring as they have more ambitious career plans than simply chasing traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on bicycles before they are chased away.
&quot;Mr. Wang, please get out of here.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ve told you that so many times!&quot; Miss Xu explains to a vendor who fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officers, the job is more monotonous than strenuous.
&quot;It&#39;s the same almost every day,&quot; said Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in her spare time.
&quot;All routine.&quot;
One reason is that the female officers are not allowed to confiscate the traders&#39; goods like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders with reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostilities, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the night&#39;s incident, and 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violent riots.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks from quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that, contrary to regulations, was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop.
The owner screamed clamor and murder.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, grim-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and proceeded with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind. He turned his white name tag over to remain anonymous.
Like their female colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they weren&#39;t trained to present a clean image.
&quot;Sometimes we take a verbal approach.&quot;
&quot;But sometimes also physically,&quot; explains Mr. Li soberly.
&quot;Most of the time, people start fighting.&quot;
The prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of charges brought against him following his affair with a former campaign worker and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator&#39;s attorneys announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal allegation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which made national headlines and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential nominee for 2012.
Senator Ensign&#39;s office said he was &quot;delighted&quot; with the verdict after the year-long investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still issue a misconduct penalty.
According to Ensign&#39;s attorneys, they were informed by the Justice Department that the investigation into Senator Ensign has been closed and that there are no further charges in the matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics advocates outside the Justice Department. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009, have suggested that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign aides, landed lucrative deals to break his silence on an affair with Hampton&#39;s wife Cynthia to purchase.
Cynthia Hampton served as Treasurer during one of Ensign&#39;s election campaigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton a job. According to the records and interrogations, he did Hampton&#39;s lobbying for them after they were hired.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign&#39;s campaign team, he was barred from lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual deal between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called prohibition on revolving door lobbycracy.
According to the released evidence, &quot;this appears to be collusion and a violation of revolving door statutes,&quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department has officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the Department appears very cautious about taking up political indictments after a series of defeats that have attracted widespread media interest including last year&#39;s decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for prosecutorial misconduct.
Prosecutors &quot;are obviously skittish,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, chair of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association of Washington (an organization whose mission is to fight corruption in the US legislature and government), a group of lawyers who advocate brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
&quot;Basically, this means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don&#39;t apply to them,&quot; she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign&#39;s lead counsel, said in an interview he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him the Department would not be filing charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign&#39;s defense attorneys had worked with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, &quot;acted in accordance with the law.&quot;
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
&quot;I&#39;m not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Justice Department and myself. Suffice it to say, we believe we made the right decision,&quot; he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to drop an investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging that a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign&#39;s parents to the Hamptons violated federal elections law.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that had long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work, thanks to Mr. Ensign&#39;s help.
A December 2008 e-mail shows that after the company promoted Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing&#39;s chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he told him he was at the Home Office about a thing &quot;knock&quot;.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after it hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about this affair first became public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth among Republicans.
Two weeks ago, after going unnoticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigations, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department&#39;s example and drop its investigation.
&quot;Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work of service to the people of Nevada,&quot; she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed away in the courtroom riots.
Every minute they sent their reports of gruesome testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
The closely-watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, will officially come to an end on Thursday when the jury&#39;s death sentence is returned.
But Mr. Hayes&#39; attorneys have already filed motions with the court setting out grounds for an appeal that will keep the courts busy for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - created a &quot;circus atmosphere&quot; and such a widespread, immediate penetration of inflammatory details that the jury in was unduly influenced by public outcry.
This objection could prompt the appellate courts to consider whether the new technologies will necessitate new rules in the courtroom.
&quot;As I experienced during this trial, I believe there is a real danger when the advent of new technology into the courtroom affects everyone&#39;s right to a fair trial,&quot; said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defender.
Presiding Justice Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of Appeals succinctly dismissed the motions last week, saying that new media would be &quot;closely controlled&quot; and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting notorious cases cast doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, said in his ruling that there was a &quot;carnival atmosphere in the courtroom&quot; because of new media.
Some believe that the TV series and feature film &quot;On the Run&quot; is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals considering Mr. Hayes&#39; conviction half a century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to control the lines of communication out of the courtroom that were in use at the time of the Dr. Hayes case. Sheppard were still unimaginable to regulate.
&quot;There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of new media in trials that are followed by the general public,&quot; said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who has researched the death penalty in Connecticut . According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts may be intrigued by the idea that restricting prompt communication from within the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many Mr. Hayes&#39; attorneys are laying out to discuss for years to delay a conviction.
Defense attorneys also contend, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test potential jurors&#39; reactions by showing them grisly crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the judges said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with disgust.
Defense attorneys say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution and that he unduly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to give the jury a weekend off.
The jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of extensive coverage of the trial are perhaps the most interesting.
In a judgment challenge they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by candidates during the campaign for governor and for the US Senate.
They argued that new media had continually reignited the flames of emotion about the case.
&quot;Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,&quot; the attorneys wrote, &quot;has not been seen before in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.&quot;
Her focus on reporting through Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that claiming that these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are made more slowly is a anti-tech gaze that impoverishes coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appellate courts are often confronted with the argument that societal and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayer&#39;s attorneys reinforce this claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the Supreme Court&#39;s 1966 decision convicting Dr. Sheppard was overturned due to the coverage and made it clear that new media required new rules.
&quot;This case,&quot; they wrote, &quot;represents Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century.&quot;
Can politeness connect what divides?
Little civility erupted in Washington this week after a campaign of swear words and negativity.
Is it the omen of genuine bipartisan cooperation or a moment of illusion before rushing back to the factional struggle in the capital?
Tuesday&#39;s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders failed to break the big questions to be dealt with during the so-called &quot;lame duck session&quot; at the end of a non-decision-making administration had.
From what is heard, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides, nor an observance of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan point-scoring.
The public meeting of the President&#39;s deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite political differences that persist among members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months breeds a mutual respect that obscures the ideological gulf that continues to separate members.
That&#39;s hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - one urging the other to show signs of cooperation and compromise while trying to gauge the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after renewed factional warfare.
As a result, Tuesday&#39;s meeting itself, and its assessment by participants, was limited to a minimum of demands or recriminations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it&#39;s about taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November elections put Washington in a mild mood, at least for a short time.
&quot;There&#39;s no question the tone has changed,&quot; said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
&quot;It&#39;s inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die out again.
And that&#39;s good.&quot;
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.&quot;
Bush&#39;s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all, whether temporarily or permanently.
A compromise on increased unemployment benefits is also likely, if only because Republicans can&#39;t afford to be believed to favor tax cuts for the wealthy while withholding support for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday&#39;s meeting at the White House, optimism has grown that agreement on these issues can be reached during the lame duck session and the New START treaty can be ratified at the same time.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the &#39;lame duck session&#39; may not necessarily result in lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
&quot;After the things that need to be done are done, that short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,&quot; he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
&quot;I see a lot of what&#39;s happening from now through 2012 as prelims, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012,&quot; he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the makeup of the new Republican majority in the White House and the Tea Party voters who helped educate them.
However concerned Republican leaders may be about playing too big a game, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut government spending and overturn health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the Deficit Commission&#39;s recommendations, which include tax reform and some tax increases, as well as raising the retirement age and cutting government spending.
Vice Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, by their own admission, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes on the commission to make their plan an official recommendation, and they&#39;re struggling to get anywhere near that number.
Most opposition is found within the body&#39;s elected officials, as there is little room or sympathy for compromise on financial issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will come next year in the form of partisan clashes as Republicans challenge Obama over the state budget, taxes and health care system, followed later by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
Evidence shows that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, both parties need to be careful about the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and find compromise.
That may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and Congressional Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and Republicans in his day.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In that light, the courtesy on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take far more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of the &quot;kleptocracy,&quot; and they pass on some of the bribes and protection money they collect to the Kremlin. The American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the state security service extort high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has dubbed the &quot;vertical of authority&quot; - takes its share of the money that goes up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
Written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow&#39;s mayor, it accuses him of corruption.
He was sacked by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that anything has been cleaned up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous libel suits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian TV channel: &quot;It&#39;s crazy, it&#39;s dirty, it&#39;s dirty.&quot;
&gt; An incredible number of Russians believe their society is corrupt. Polls have shown that.
But it is unusual for individuals to be named, as was done in the Ambassador&#39;s report, and it is unheard of for a diplomat from a foreign country to do so.
&quot;Moscow&#39;s government&#39;s direct association with crime has led some to label it &#39;disturbed&#39; and conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government,&quot; the memo said.
&quot;Criminal elements enjoy a &#39;kryshna&#39; (a term from the criminal/mafia world, literally meaning &#39;roof&#39; or shelter) spread across the police, State Security (FSB), Service Inspectorate (MVD) and Bureau of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have uncovered a three-tiered structure within Moscow&#39;s criminal world.
&quot;Luzhkov comes first.&quot;
&quot;FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second tier.&quot;
&quot;Last there are the common criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level.&quot;
&quot;This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city doesn&#39;t offer any help.&quot;
The report goes on to say that the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source said it &quot;explained that Moscow&#39;s business owners understand that it&#39;s best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime), not only because they have more weapons, resources and power than they do criminals, but also because they are protected by the law.&quot;
&quot;For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as important as it used to be.&quot;
The memo notes that while the fundraising is extensive, the shelter itself can&#39;t be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don&#39;t pay find their business closed very quickly - on one or two pretexts.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, while noting that he has made little progress.
The embassy&#39;s memo contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases believed to be full of money.
&quot;Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats in his fight against corruption,&quot; said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, in a recent interview.
&quot;But he&#39;s part of this bureaucracy.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.&quot;
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the NGO Transparence International (countries are ranked from &quot;least corrupt&quot; to &quot;most corrupt&quot;).
The unveiling of the US embassy&#39;s memo, which happened late in the evening Moscow time, is sure to spark displeasure within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow&#39;s mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be fake and reacted furiously at the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev called him Robin.
&quot;The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,&quot; he said.
&quot;But to be honest, we didn&#39;t expect it to be done with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.&quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School commemorates the man who built it, later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
&quot;Everyone here loves Ta Mok.&quot;
&quot;He was a good leader and he took care of his people,&quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as &quot;the butcher&quot; for his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold of northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of ex-soldiers still reside .
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to confront publicly those who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that, for the first time, tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of ex-soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian tribunal convicted a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time when it sentenced former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Alnlong Veng&#39;s Khmer Rouge veterans, hampering their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
&quot;There is still resentment and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,&quot; said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
&quot;For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.&quot;
&quot;It even divides families.&quot;
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork, or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border in Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla warfare from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok raised the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace accord led to the country&#39;s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge militants began defecting to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998 led.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had not backed down, was arrested by government forces near the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many held the movement in nostalgic memories.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their arms, the rank and file remained poor, uneducated peasants.
&quot;These people have benefited very little from the surrender,&quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
&quot;They are rooted in the regime&#39;s utopian agrarian ideology.&quot;
&quot;They grew up without any professional knowledge.&quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to make a living as a poor rice farmer.
&quot;Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,&quot; he said.
&quot;Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat.&quot;
&quot;But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves.&quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year the court will try to try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court&#39;s mandate is to try the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it has not said it will prosecute beyond these four cases.
That did little to ease fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that is believed to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her Khmer Rouge past.
If the court summons her, she would refuse to go, she said.
&quot;Cambodia lives in peace and stability,&quot; she said.
&quot;If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here.&quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court indicted more suspects, although experts and historians debate this.
&quot;Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past,&quot; he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
&quot;Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces together,&quot; he said.
&quot;It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything.&quot;
The center created the first government-sanctioned textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page &quot;History of Democratic Cambodia.&quot;
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education&#39;s high school history book, which contains fewer than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city&#39;s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
&quot;My family rejects many parts of the book and the dish,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court.&quot;
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence,&quot; he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and littered with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot&#39;s body was cremated on a pile of tires here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone seller, said she didn&#39;t know much about the man who was burned here.
&quot;But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray,&quot; she said.
It was Nuom Sothea&#39;s birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot&#39;s final resting place where she will drop a bush of ripe bananas - hoping it will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to no longer accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama&#39;s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the Belarus government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in a supplemental article to the security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and appeared to have hit a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told the Washington Post that two secret deals were struck with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday&#39;s agreement to remove the rest of the material - around £500, according to an official who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The deal appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama&#39;s April &quot;47-nation Nuclear Security Summit,&quot; which excluded Belarus.
And it was apparently good enough to secure the former Soviet republic&#39;s invitation to the next summit in 2012.
&quot;I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012).&quot;
&quot;It proves to me that it works,&quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal &quot;a very significant, important step&quot; by Belarus.
In April 2009 in Prague, Obama promised to secure all vulnerable nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama&#39;s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up uranium.
&quot;We keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium,&quot; Lukashenko said at the time.
&quot;This is our raw material... We will not make dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell it to anyone&quot;.
&quot;We use it for research purposes only, that&#39;s all.&quot;
Belarus, however, drew closer to the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus&#39; uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly contaminated, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that would travel more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to officials, was carried out by plane.
The US government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going to Belarusian research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used in nuclear weapons.
&quot;This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,&quot; which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Disclosure Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus intends to liquidate its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko&#39;s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday&#39;s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
&quot;Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in enhancing bilateral relations and is essential to the country&#39;s progress and its citizens,&quot; she explains.
No objection from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA&#39;s flights carrying Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a cable from the US ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents exposed by Wikileaks and forwarded (by cable) to the daily newspaper &quot;El País&quot;. It adds that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed &quot;to demonstrate that foreign planes flying over Spain are properly monitored.&quot;
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe denouncing aiding and abetting abusive practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega met.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted the Council&#39;s report &quot;got Zapatero offside&quot; and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide on the matter.
&quot;De la Vega underlined that Spain had no objection to the secret service flights over Spanish territory.&quot;
&quot;They just want to be informed&quot; so as not to &quot;get caught off guard,&quot; Aguirre reports via cable.
Former foreign minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also warned the ambassador that the Spanish government &quot;does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as it is in the hands of the judges.&quot;
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, indicated to the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents from the Spanish National Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
&quot;These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information,&quot; the ambassador said after speaking with the prosecutor.
Despite this, the US was more concerned about the &quot;apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and German prosecutors&quot; than the declassified information from the CNI and the Department of Defense.
&quot;This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maintain discretion between governments,&quot; Aguirre said.
At a March 2007 lunch attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that &quot;although the Spanish judges are insanely self-reliant and do what they see fit,&quot; he said instructed his staff to &quot;avoid pompous rhetorical comments in order to ease the tension.&quot;
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP&#39;s handling of the matter.
&quot;Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that, on an indication that the Zapateros administration has tolerated or willfully ignored US actions that could be construed as possible human rights abuses, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government,&quot; he points out.
The child killer admits she has complained about the &quot;hardships&quot; of motherhood online.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was dead and she had a blog: &quot;Terror Galician style&quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is &quot;Muki&quot; on the internet.
She keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend under this nickname, which she has had since she was a child. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand her, one must know her love life, which the ABC newspaper reconstructs on the basis of testimonies from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began dating Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up their relationship, it was announced that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she entered another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring parish.
She lived with him for a long time.
Cesar stayed with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they parted.
In March 2008 she was alone in Menorca and wrote: &quot;Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came here to work.&quot;
&quot;When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not be free to do whatever he wants.&quot;
She later mentions a message she&#39;s just received on her cell phone: &quot;I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send the boy to.&quot;
She complains: &quot;If he doesn&#39;t like that I leave the boy with my mother, I&#39;ll pick him up when I get back.&quot;
In May she talks about returning to her village: &quot;I&#39;m going there this week, but I&#39;ll only stay there until the 19th because I have to present myself for a job on the 20th if I don&#39;t want to lose it.&quot;
She explains that if all goes well, she will take her firstborn with her.
&quot;He&#39;ll be with who he needs to be with, that is, me. I&#39;ll never let him be with anyone but my mother ever again,&quot; a dubious intention given their shaky relationship.
There will be another email in July.
As she writes these, the assumption is that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
&quot;On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he isn&#39;t.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand he&#39;s with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day.&quot;
She speaks of moving to Mallorca.
&quot;He (the boy) will attend a summer school there, so I have less expenses for the nanny.&quot;
On the 17th: memories and lamentations.
&quot;A big kiss from César who asks me when you&#39;re coming.&quot;
&quot;Alberto says he sent me some videos via email. You see, if he wants, he can find me, what a bummer.&quot;
Another on the 30th: &quot;The boy is fine. He&#39;s going to a summer school to learn Catalan.&quot;
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: &quot;He advances me money.&quot;
There are messages from her on the internet, in anime and manga blogs.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, now blocked, where she called herself &quot;Muki the Prisoner&quot;.
&quot;Terror a la gallega (headline)&quot;.
The last man to live with her, a sworn game warden, says he has remorse because he feels guilty.
He can&#39;t believe it all happened because she didn&#39;t tell him she was a single mom.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Menorca Court Prisoners&#39; Center to Palma&#39;s provincial prison.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, said she couldn&#39;t remember what happened, &quot;and that she had no intention of harming the little one.&quot;
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and putting his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular gained 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28th, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already turning its attention to the parliamentary elections - early or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party gets in these elections is usually double that of the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People&#39;s Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, compared to 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the diversion of the PSC&#39;s share of the vote and the binding of the PP electorate - were to continue, PP analysts predict that in the general election the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU could also have four (it has now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 MEPs (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People&#39;s Party analysis, the ERC would lose one MEP - it currently has three - while ICV could keep its MEP or gain one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date will be municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People&#39;s Party (PP) can still have the say in putting an end to socialist dominance in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the PP agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists can neither win a majority nor fall back on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, where it should win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced they can play the leading role in Tarragona&#39;s reversal. There they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
The People&#39;s Party was also able to record significant growth in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is currently present in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by officers from the Barcelona Police Intelligence Branch formed the Thailand-based jihadist cell that controlled various Al Qaeda groups, including the Tamil Eelam Liberation Movement (LTTE) and Lashkar e-Taiba &quot; (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombings in Bombay that claimed 106 lives in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish interior minister attaches great importance to these investigations, going so far as to say that &quot;Operation Kampai&quot; has &quot;weakened&quot; Al Qaeda&#39;s counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and &quot;thus their ability to act.&quot;
The researchers believe that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy , so that their &quot;fighters&quot; could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that attacks similar to those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday will take place in the EU in the next few days.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung of Thailand were arrested.
They had headed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was wiped out in 2009 - notably stole tourist passports under the specifications of the so-called &quot;International Islamic Front&quot;.
This means that the documents had to be in the names of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In investigative circles it is underlined that until now no connection between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay could be proven, although the author of this attack, &quot;Laschkar e-Taiba&quot; was one of the recipient groups of the ones stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand passports.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia by a money transfer company, which were &quot;invested&quot; in the purchase of prepaid cell phone cards, later used by the members of the &quot;Command &quot;, which ended the lives of 106 people, were used.
The police confiscated extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas with her conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those already asked during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of the economic recovery and the refraining from regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial equalization agreement, which the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People&#39;s Party turned to Artur Mas with confidence, who gave her the 18 MPs she won last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make her feel indispensable. Because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the Regionalists want to forge in the upcoming general elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As for the party leader of the PPC, the latter demands that, in support of the accession to office, &quot;all discourses related to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia&quot; as well as an agreement on financial equalization between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to that of the Basque Country - and that of the party leader by CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, to be employed at the back.
What both political leaders have in common is that they want to streamline the regional administration&#39;s overblown political apparatus and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are tackling the details of Mas&#39;s inauguration negotiations.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reiterates that the deaths are not due to &quot;a lack of action&quot;.
The owners of the nursing home in Olot do not rule out that their carer killed more than eleven elderly people
Those in charge of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference highlighting the damage caused by the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who killed at least 11 elderly people he was responsible for while working - had inflicted on the facility.
The manager of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that &quot;La Caritat wants to prosecute those responsible (for the deaths)&quot; but &quot;the law and our liability compel us to do so and accept civil liability&quot;.
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social reputation because it did not detect the carer&#39;s criminal acts in time, but now also has to pay a large amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims&#39; family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to kill ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illnesses.
The head of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that &quot;lack of action could never have been the reason for the incidents.&quot;
La Caritat&#39;s attorney added that &quot;there is no evidence in the litigation of negligent acts by any person other than the accused.&quot;
The man who had already been christened the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime, in which he administered a mix of tranquilizers.
The head of La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff access to the medicines.
The nurse used the insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six of the nine crimes committed in order to free the patients from their suffering by dying.
But the results of the lab tests will reveal whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less gruesome death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by dosing them with bleach, as he confessed he had done to three women he had killed between murdered on October 12th and 17th.
In La Caritat, the nurse&#39;s statements are not believed, not even as regards the number of admitted murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had given very different testimonies in court and that there was no point in suddenly changing his modus operandi after eight successful murders.
They say they made it available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to ECB President Trichet&#39;s threat that &quot;markets should not underestimate our ability to react.&quot;
The risk premiums of the euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the stocks of the European banks by more than 5%.
That said, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB is wrong and the euro has barely made any gains, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday&#39;s events are typical of an illiquid market which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, albeit as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
Institutional investors are far from losing their fears.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which the ECB will have to back down tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and likely many more times into the future.
The Bundesbank called for the government debt purchase plan to be terminated as it was ineffective and for all exceptional temporary liquidity measures to be lifted. Only one-week unlimited access should be retained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended &quot;at least until March&quot; and to maintain quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the bond buying program to continue and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, yesterday&#39;s excellent reaction in the markets will be reversed and if there is a stubborn insistence that we reverse our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reiterated that it would not consider buying government debt and markets subsequently collapsed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she bared her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was quite weak.
The State Treasury spent just 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Despite this, interest rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a shift in market perceptions, Trichet said.
In Ireland, Allied and Bank of Ireland debt hole figures were released.
The total is estimated at around 10,000 million in the short term and a possible 15,000 more. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost all credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the July stress tests, the figures under the bailout plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. Still lacking sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated her discourse in view of the summit of heads of state and government on December 14th. Political unity is required there to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven&#39;s ninth symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan that is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi&#39;s Four Seasons to investors&#39; ears.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market is up 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European bourses.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Spanish central bank has been quick and persuasive, and we are benefiting from the element of surprise.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. We are therefore counting on strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our ability to restructure our debt.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don&#39;t need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are exceedingly expensive and access to markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to the motto of Caesar&#39;s wife: &quot;Now it&#39;s not just being that counts, but also appearances.&quot;
Have courage, we can do it!
The CEO of Eulen, at the request of his children, challenges the shareholders&#39; meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro companies, does not abate.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest El Enebro&#39;s shareholders&#39; meeting, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it &quot;absolutely void&quot;. His children will try to get a majority to control the governing bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare legal action for a new judiciary chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest business services holding seems unwilling to back down in his legal battle over control of El Enebro&#39;s boards.
He was driven out of the board of directors by five of his seven children. At the shareholders&#39; meeting on January 18 of this year, which has already been entered as contested in the commercial register, they appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors.
The shareholders&#39; meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, triggered a new thunderclap in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Appeal to the judge to schedule the meeting is the only legal way that guarantees the convening of the shareholders&#39; meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a &quot;desperate means by the claimants - his five children - to use legal sophistry, fraud and abuse of rights to impose the annulled March 18 Assembly . January to be recognized&quot;, as official spokesmen explain.
This reasoning is the basis for the ex post challenge to the assembly to declare it &quot;absolutely void&quot;.
The same protagonists, who remain discreetly silent, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting through the courts.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez&#39;s seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family records, the founder of the service group demands the right to use 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the matter the judge is to decide at the challenge hearing, which has not yet been set a date.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Ever since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, their history in this exquisite universe of speed has been one of surprises and successes.
Initially no one paid any attention to the newcomer and despite his rapid rise over the past few seasons, everyone was counting on Fernando Alonso&#39;s Ferrari to win in the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to belittle the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the &quot;secret weapon&quot; that the multinational Siemens put into Red Bull&#39;s hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This informatics program, called PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon&#39;s cameras, Sukhoi&#39;s airplanes and Nissan&#39;s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software at the Red Bull Formula 1 factory, &quot;in a few hours, almost in real time&quot;, the changes and improvements detected during the races and tests can design and execute.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the racing teams, who could introduce at most three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull&#39;s team. Using high-performance EDP systems, they carry out analyzes and all sorts of modifications to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull&#39;s racing cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault claims sole responsibility.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The workforce consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull&#39;s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion, Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of its participation on the circuits, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is nil.
The plant&#39;s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago it was still possible to say that advances in racing car R&amp;D contributed 50 percent to victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while pilot contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computing because they &quot;are unpredictable gladiators&quot;.
HP will open twenty of its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) yesterday in Barcelona inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of twenty stores, each between 80 and 100 square meters, that the multinational intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España Vice President Helena Herrero gave the example of the converted store on Barcelona&#39;s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third deal.
Herrera didn&#39;t want to reveal the upcoming new openings but didn&#39;t rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, said the store opening philosophy is always the same. They rely on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes care of the exclusive shop fittings (with interactive products you can touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive network of points of sale aims to &quot;optimize after-sales service and advice to small and micro businesses before and after purchase, even packaging&quot;.
The Barcelona store has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical center in Maastricht (Holland).
&quot;In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days.&quot;
&#39;This system has been developed particularly for small and micro businesses and private customers, as the large companies already have their technical support service contracts,&#39; explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to &#39;steal&#39; its rival a million customers in three years
Banco Sabadell&#39;s executive director Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other executives. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nonetheless, he foresees a collapse in interest rate spreads, which banks are attempting to offset by increasing fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture 1 million retail customers in three years -- a league to come.
Sabadell has found the way to make the most of the next three years, surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-year master plan.
The goal is not only to survive without recourse to FROB public aid, but also to increase market share by one million retail customers - 700,000 if you subtract the customers the bank will lose. This is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its commercial customers than to its private customers.
This year she added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, ie austerity, cost reduction. She will present the challenges that the bank is facing with this together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has thrown all the plans of the banks all over the world into disarray.
This year Sabadell will complete its Optima roadmap set out four years ago. This was initially designed for three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a &quot;difficult&quot; year &quot;with great scope&quot;.
The manager assumes that Spain would only &quot;slowly&quot; emerge from the crisis.
In addition, it would be &quot;very difficult&quot; to &quot;create work&quot; in two or three years - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even as he expects the liabilities war - which penalizes interest margins - to abate, the risk premium banks and thrifts must pay on their issues to maintain liquidity is already being passed on to the price of credit to compensate for shrinking profit margins .
&quot;The liquidity and funding issues are structural and they will put pressure on credit.&quot;
&quot;We haven&#39;t turned off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high,&quot; admitted Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to limit long-term lending and increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of November 22 and 27).
The manager also admitted the banks&#39; current strategy is to &quot;increase fees&quot;, albeit &quot;within a competitive framework&quot;.
Sabadell&#39;s roadmap is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate deals.
It is not for nothing that he affirms that &quot;larger companies are necessary&quot; in Spain.
&quot;Everything will change in the coming year,&quot; he assures.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is &quot;growing enormously&quot; at the moment and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He thinks the FROB can replace the money market for capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary market shutdown, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be circulated, but unlike what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repurchase agreements, thereby cushioning the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of savings bank mergers
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of savings bank mergers and stressed the speed with which the sector was being restructured.
When the Spanish Savings Banks concentration process began, several Savings Banks insisted not to participate in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the director general of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
&quot;I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather they were adjustments.&quot;
&quot;Most of it has been completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who have been very supportive of all operations.&quot;
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process &quot;was carried out as quickly as possible and we must be satisfied with the timeliness that was achieved in the past, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España have been finalized,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million in assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which means that we have fulfilled the Basel Accord.&quot; , he pointed out.
Olavarrieta explained that &quot;there are a number of misguided opinions about the slowness of the process that reveal dubiousness and folly&quot; because &quot;Banco de España urges us to close the deal before the end of the year.&quot;
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta affirmed yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems in Europe and &quot;perhaps&quot; in the world, adding that those who question it do so &quot;without in-depth knowledge&quot;.
The manager noted that in the current economic climate we &quot;do not have to worry&quot; about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have gone through a &quot;very significant&quot; concentration process that will be completed &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress test carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have prompted a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax breaks for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for provoking the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel&#39;s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany adopts a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future that clashes with maintaining the long-established traditions of most of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, people in Germany are beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although that sounds more like science fiction at the moment - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The Third: A Reshaping of the Euro According to German Proposals. That means: more macroeconomic control; strict housekeeping; penalizing countries that break the rules; possibly the default of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. So now there are no excuses.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits and the German government pulled up a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
That was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany saw as necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The Central European country set the second sign when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
It was heavily criticized at the time. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public and published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel came out again with a clear position. She calls for a reform of the European Union&#39;s agreements to allow a country to be rescued while requiring private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was construed as anti-European as it fueled the Irish Crisis and all that followed.
But her suggestion, albeit a little sweetened, was accepted. In the coming months we will be involved in the reform of the European Union, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old way of working for the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which violating countries will be severely penalized, can be forced to declare bankruptcy and in which case the private sector will have to bear part of the cost.
Germany is showing us that we need to embark on a tough growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as that spearheaded by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It&#39;s not just about reducing the national deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to more calm.
And that we will use the opportunities that are offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday&#39;s meeting with big business and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis that order to create in-house has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there and it doesn&#39;t look like anything will change.
Among the possibilities under consideration, one that cannot be ruled out is that we would have to leave the euro area, which is crammed with less serious countries.
In that case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and evasion of the rules
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The exclusion allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink being spilled over whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act acted and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) the two players lost time and played several fouls to get the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead their group, the two players will meet the mandatory sanction in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without tickets.
Eventually, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee fined the club&#39;s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in these or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It&#39;s so widespread that it&#39;s part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are followed in the sport.
Part of the debate that has ensued around the case presented stems from the fact that a team from Real Madrid football club (which promotes nobility and honor in its anthem and has on other occasions punished its players for similar incidents) starred in it, and from the dramatization by it Mourinho, who added one more episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behavior, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of the sport, but seems to circumvent its spirit.
In this matter, the damage done to sportsmanship should be examined.
Sportsmanship defends the physical integrity of opponents, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of clean play is to avoid allowing the offending players to take undue advantage of the opposing team. That didn&#39;t happen either.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it is not what we usually understand by cheating or circumventing the rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as obvious as possible , to be penalized by the referee.
The players waited and happily accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of benefit the offenders got from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was not put in a less favorable position, nor was any advantage demanded for the game being played, since the obvious result of this action was that one&#39;s team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It&#39;s also not a useful strategy for the next game because the club doesn&#39;t have those players.
The benefit, obviously, is that players start the next phase of the Champions League with no cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it&#39;s a long-term benefit, uncertain to some degree, as the team could also be eliminated at some point. Also, with this practice, players are penalized and move into the second card cycle, where they are eliminated due to card accumulation with one card fewer than in the first cycle.
It is therefore not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices do not go against the spirit of sportsmanship, which includes making strategic decisions to get the most out of the regulations.
In this case, the players didn&#39;t want to circumvent a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without dodging or escaping punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the rules were provoked.
The harm done to the principles of sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
Promotion campaign to attract customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar is dropping an avalanche of reservations on December 16th and 17th this year.
Employee self-sponsored celebrations are spreading. You don&#39;t want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the Christmas lottery, the run-up to Christmas also sees the return of group dinners that breathe new life into Barcelona&#39;s hospitality and leisure industries. But as a result of the economic crisis, they are launching a price offensive in order to capture the customer segment that represents the great majority: almost everyone would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To add a bit of complexity to the accounting, the calendar (New Year&#39;s Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th). ) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times started, many companies have stopped group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many employees pay for it out of their own pockets.
Whatever the state of the economy, rock-bottom prices are required, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Catering Council, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
&quot;People think twice before making a reservation.&quot;
&quot;They want to go out, but they&#39;re very price conscious,&quot; he says.
Business will be good for those &quot;who offer quality at good prices with good service,&quot; he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are the most popular.
A survey of various centrally located restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17th causes the suppliers to collapse.
The Soteras group says demand is booming this Friday with intentions to spend less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus to the economic situation with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros.
For another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 inns in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early bookings, even from early November.
&quot;We have done the impossible to maintain last year&#39;s prices with menus for all tastes ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros,&quot; he explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 establishments, is not losing optimism after the revenues have been booming again since the second quarter and the prospects for the Christmas business are good, albeit concentrated in a few days.
Group sources highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating the run-up to Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus as a price hit. One gets the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and in return want more details, such as cava.
Green sprouts can also be seen in some companies, which is why the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that group meals are on the rise again.
On the part of the Fecasarm umbrella organization (with coalitions such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Federation), vice-president Enric Gomà trusts that he can see the end of the tunnel and notes that overall reservations are quite &quot;lively&quot;, despite the fact that the customers &quot;get the most out of it&quot;.
However, the fun of partying has not decreased, no matter who pays.
Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program is a major concern in the US
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons &quot;faster than any other country&quot;.
Wikileaks revelations confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program in Washington.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not increasing, but on the contrary &quot;decreasing&quot;. , and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons &quot;at a faster pace than any other country.&quot;
In particular, the nature of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but rather stored individually to make them more difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is giving Washington sleepless nights.
Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson lists the following risks in a report ahead of the visit of former National Security Council chief James Jones: &quot;The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the likely dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material&quot;.
The large numbers of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs are no longer viewed not only by the US but also by Russia as sprawling and a reason to exercise caution.
&quot;Pakistan needs to hire strictly religious personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs,&quot; Russian foreign ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a briefing with its North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentary unveiled by Julian Assange&#39;s web portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is waning and the increased pace at which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office, which describes communication with Pakistan as &quot;frustrating,&quot; said: &quot;Often there is no transparency; offers of help go unanswered or are rejected.&quot;
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official with the state intelligence agency for South Asia, confirmed that &quot;despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons faster than any other country.&quot;
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani to &quot;make it clear&quot; to those responsible that &quot;Pakistan&#39;s army must stop its tacit support of terrorist groups.&quot;
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high-ranking officer in charge of counterterrorism to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol issues red alert to track and locate Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated maze in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Interpol yesterday issued a &quot;red alert&quot; to &quot;find and prosecute&quot; Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it&#39;s not new, it&#39;s from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse the Australian is facing in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer for Wikileaks founder, Mark Stephens, assures that &quot;the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.&quot;
Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden&#39;s request, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities received the authorization.
That&#39;s the way things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange &quot;in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him.&quot;
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, the organization says many member countries view the red alert as a warrant for arrest - to be carried out by national police - particularly if they have a bilateral extradition treaty. as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move outraged Assange&#39;s lawyers, who gestured to publish a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied to leave Sweden and was granted permission by the prosecutor, who has been compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin&#39;s chief of security.
&quot;This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution,&quot; the letter said.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia pleads her son&#39;s innocence - Assange is in an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location. During the meeting, he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
&quot;If it can be shown that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign,&quot; he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request to resign &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,&quot; he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorist official, Russell Travers, with preventing new disclosures of documents.
President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman&#39;s attempt to de-emphasise Assange is at odds with the views conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of listing Wikileaks as a terrorist organization &quot;to seize their funds and anyone who supports them or makes a contribution to pursue.&quot;
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further and had to retract his statement that Assange &quot;must be assassinated&quot;.
&quot;Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.&quot;
The one who didn&#39;t apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
&quot;Whoever it was that leaked information in government is guilty of treason and anything other than execution is too light a sentence,&quot; he told Fox.
Puigcercós, with a nod to those close to Carod, seeks peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret ballot on his continued tenure.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for avoiding, for the umpteenth time, an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after losing 11 MPs and half the electorate.
The party leader is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the sector&#39;s influence is now as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headaches as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For starters, ERC announced yesterday that ERC&#39;s 200-plus regional councilors could comment secretly on his retention.
With ballot papers, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to ticket the president, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to himself.
In several interviews he reiterated that he would not feel vindicated with half the votes plus one, adding without giving percentages that a &quot;Bulgarian-style&quot; result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod are demanding more from the president than simply making his office available to the party. An inadequate gesture given that Puigcercós controls the supreme body of the Congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board on a course of action from now through May.
In return, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the leadership will submit to the Council for approval on the 18th.
Your intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he should promise to bring the congress forward to autumn 2011, which the party leadership already believes to be a fact.
The ERC party leader believes the &quot;polyphony&quot; is damaging to stability and wants once and for all to enable the organization to do its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting conseller Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació took it for granted that the party leader was being supported &quot;in exchange for various goals&quot;.
He listed five, two of which stand out.
First, the &quot;restructuring&quot; of the board to represent at least 90 percent of party members, that is, to include new faces from Carod&#39;s circle.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a mode of operation.
He advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcercós&#39; team, which fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the trembling 2008 assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of assembly at a congress to deal with reforming the statutes.
This appointment has not yet been made, since due to the internal turmoil of recent years, it was not advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lying in wait, it might be time to revisit this matter and close it for good.
23 murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, four fewer cases were recorded in México than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, four fewer than in the previous month, according to MILENIO México counts.
Notable among those killed were three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year we come to a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca, stands out.
The subject had at least three gunshot wounds, the coup de grace was fired to his head, and his feet and hands were bound with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street, in Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan municipality.
Early in the morning on Thursday 4th, farm workers found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal bullet wounds in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
A note believed to be signed by criminal organization La Familia Michoacana was found next to the body.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot dead eight times after leaving his home to do his job as a refuse collector.
On November 7, two 30-year-old people died as a result of being shot in the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement of Ecatepec township.
In Chalcro, the body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body was a bullet casing fired from a caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the Playa Golondrina settlement.
Emergency services searched for the remaining body parts but could not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they found in the Peña Colorada area. The hands were tied behind and the head was bandaged.
The man had a wound from a firearm shot in the neck.
In the middle of the month it was reported the murder of two men wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. Two death threats were also found next to the victims.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the Los Reyes La Paz locality.
The remainder of the body was found in a nearby settlement in a black plastic bag with a note signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body, wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, was found in Huixquilucan of a man who, according to the message left next to him by his killers, probably called Mario Ríos.
A woman&#39;s lifeless body was found in the San Francisco Acuautla community of Ixtapaluca with bullet holes in her neck from a firearm.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with corresponding images were discovered on the woman&#39;s skin.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three bullet holes and a note signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, their heads covered with tape, and a notice were discovered in the Puente de Piedra parish of Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a note, presumably signed by a criminal organization, which read: &quot;This will happen to those who don&#39;t cooperate.&quot;
In Ecatepec, two bodies with their hands and feet bound and signs of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the Justice Center in the San Agustín settlement.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl communities.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and tied up in black plastic bags, with a notice lying next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the Juárez settlement in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message on it.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China&#39;s representative at COP16 said his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would stand by its bid to cut 40-45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, says Su Wei, the country&#39;s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei asserted that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon emissions and transform its industry.
He said his country had invested $245 million over the past four years to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals but would work on the matter together with the international community.
He explained that China&#39;s climate change strategy is divided into four strands: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and pilot program support.
Progress has been made on all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, state authorities have worked together with central and local governments to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficient use and emissions reduction.
He also said several multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he was referring to the Energy Efficient Use Program that has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, the government&#39;s scientific adviser on climate change in that country, confirmed that China&#39;s efforts are far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The PAN national leader said the former panist party leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the law allowed him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barriento was legal and that the former PAN party leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the law allows him.
In an interview before Gabino Cué Monteagudo&#39;s appeal as state governor, he explained that Espino&#39;s expulsion was a decision made at the local level.
&quot;It is an independent decision by the Order Commission in Sonora.&quot;
&quot;Mr Espino has the right to submit his case to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional through the appeals channel, so that a decision is taken by a competent body,&quot; he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it&#39;s not time to think about 2012 and that a presidential candidate alliance has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on December 4th and 5th to elect his successor.
&quot;This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a municipal election proposal, it was successful and it served its purpose,&quot; he said.
The panist leader explained that PAN has 71 years of dialogue, so &quot;internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, &quot;we enjoy it and it strengthens us&quot;, he commented.
He said the Council would no doubt select the best President or President Acción Nacional needed for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the baton &quot;to whoever the council would determine.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m completely unconcerned and open about it. I would be proud to appoint any of the five to be party leaders.&quot;
He predicted that the party&#39;s upswing seen in the last July 4 election would be reflected in the next election, although &quot;it&#39;s not the time to think about 2012.&quot;
&quot;Now it&#39;s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.&quot;
In this regard, he highlighted that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would fly the flag and be watched across the country. That&#39;s why &quot;a lot of hopes and longings are placed in her and I&#39;m sure that Gabino is up to the task.&quot;
When asked about the PRI&#39;s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse during his four-year reign, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
&quot;If the PRI thinks that the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Calderón ones, they should start defending them, should they finally come out of the closet,&quot; he affirmed.
He believes that the holder of the federal government should use expressions like those he is making in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no ban on the mouth, much less censorship.
Obama campaigns on Twitter for undocumented student law
&quot;If you&#39;re in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge this bill to be passed,&quot; the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social media site.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - legalizing undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
&quot;If you want the Dream Act passed, call your senators and push for this legislation to pass,&quot; Obama tweeted.
His memo contains a cyberlink to a larger document urging the public to contact their senators shortly as the bill&#39;s vote is imminent.
&quot;With your voice we&#39;re waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,&quot; he emphasizes.
The news broke after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes on any legislation unless it expanded the Bush-era tax breaks and increased government funding.
Such a deadlock, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the Dream Act vote and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
When asked about Republicans&#39; blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he had confidence that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects could be established.
&quot;I think we still have plenty of time...&quot;
&quot;We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year...&quot;
&quot;I think we can always come to an agreement on that and then we can plan the flow of the rest,&quot; he said.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that &quot;he would request a vote to close the debate&quot; so that the Dream Act, legislation that would legalize undocumented students, could be voted on in the Senate next Thursday could be, although next week is more likely.
The Dream Act version, or the American Dream law, would have approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States before they were sixteen years of age have lived in that country for the past five years and at a higher education institutions or enrolled in the army.
But the bill&#39;s supporters need sixty votes to pass the initiative, so they&#39;re reliant on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organizations that advocate this project are organizing intensive lobbying for the passage of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That&#39;s why defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to back out of the initiative.
Among the most sought-after Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Utah&#39;s Orrin Hatch and Texas&#39; Kay Bailey Hutchinson, but they said they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported the law, John McCain, has yet to state his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of &#39;The Pleasure of Language&#39; was a walk in which the participants championed the narrative
&quot;I understand about the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?&quot; asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of &#39;Los placeres de la lengua&#39; , a cycle celebrating Spanish-language literature, using the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
A finger in a wound... &quot;gets us in trouble,&quot; the Argentine writer spat sweetly at the audience, made up mostly of young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to host Marisol Shultz&#39;s To attend a round table attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz later characterized as a great story. Luisa narrates in the first person and is the protagonist who, in search of finding out what a &quot;wound&quot; is, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not receive an answer, but from whom she receives hints for the thread of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: &quot;Patience is not my strength, maybe that&#39;s my wound.&quot;
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who left her breathless in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: &quot;The wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar.&quot;
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she &quot;only found out about the wound that it was really open and didn&#39;t exist&quot;. But she is convinced that the joy of language and its pitfalls are mixed up.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful tale he called &#39;Praise of Invention&#39; in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back men who had traveled far, or restored a girl&#39;s lost virtue. The narrative made a U-turn and reported on America, the great novel, which from the beginning was not lacking its own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the profusion of stories told by the conquerors.
&quot;Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination betraying even the sense of shame.&quot;
However, as he points out, &quot;it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best&quot;, and that is where reality and lies converge, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature does summit reached.
He actually calls this the &#39;Tradition Cervantes&#39;.
&quot;We inherited from him to be what is told.&quot;
When it was Mayra Montero&#39;s turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which FIl&#39;s invitation to the &#39;The Finger in the Wound&#39; round table had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated her contribution to the great wound of societal violence that is afflicting her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over the drug trade.
&quot;I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not intentionally planned,&quot; she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and commitment that flows between the author and the readers like a &quot; chemical reaction&quot;.
The evening ended with the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also emphasized &quot;that committed writer&#39;s finger in the writer&#39;s wound&quot;.
He noted that in a fast-moving world, even intellectual habits and control of consciousness boil down to dogmatism, forgetting &quot;that behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes.&quot;
&quot;To be in possession of our thoughts and of reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means to put your finger in the wound and harass those who are much more comfortable with it in caricature form, in black and white , thinking in ready-made ideas without nuances, and also bothering the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted and invited to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has lost three finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has played crucial games.
The Santos Laguna-Monterrey clash in the final also pits two different styles dictated by their respective coaches, and their contrasting encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has lost three finals, he&#39;s had ups and downs in his career, but he&#39;s had three decisive games and so far he&#39;s held up well, so this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine leveled his way up to second champion with the medal, he&#39;s a step behind the winners and amazingly he&#39;s played back-to-back finals with the same team.
The santistic strategist reached his first final as coach at the &#39;Torneo Apertura 2002&#39;, when del Morelia took the reins in a big 4-2 defeat against Toluca; later, at the &#39;Clausura 2003&#39; he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the &#39;Torneo Bicentenario 2010&#39; where they played Los Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback as the game ended in a 2-2 draw against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but he came back from the penalty spot with 3 -1 forward and got two chances to pocket his title, but ultimately three of his players missed 11 steps and the game went 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. That&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t want to be afflicted again and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate his first title, although he reiterates that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
&quot;I want to be champion, I don&#39;t want to break a statistic, it&#39;s for a club, for my affection I&#39;m devoting myself to and that&#39;s why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing,&quot; commented the helmsman, when asked about the lost finals.
He still has a strong memory of the last final, and he assures that he learned a lot from it: &quot;The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee blows the whistle, we can&#39;t celebrate, we&#39;re in the The line is prepared, the players too because last time we were prepared to go out with two penalties and I think that&#39;s a lesson, until the game is over there&#39;s no reason to celebrate.&quot;
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalties doesn&#39;t worry him because he trusts his players: &quot;You never want to end up on penalties, you want to finish in regular time, but sometimes there&#39;s no alternative and you have to be prepared for that , in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate gave us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or a strong desire to already hold the title in our hands, that left us something for this final and we hope that it will won&#39;t be able to do that this time.&quot;
It is in Romanso&#39;s power to move beyond being second champion and savoring the glory that titles bring for the first time.
The USA is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Before their interview at the consulate, the persons must present themselves to the service points for visa applications; Costs will be waiting times are shortened.
Effective January 10, 2011, procedures for applying for a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulates are changing.
Under the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the Visa Application Service Center (ASC, the initials in English) before their interview at the consulate.
The ASC staff takes the applicant&#39;s biometric data, which is checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new process has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of visa processing is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant makes only a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for tourist visas, $150 for visas with application (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for traders and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not need to have an interview at the consulate, they just need to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since the biometric data is collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate have less time there than before.
Those who apply for visas at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Additional information about the new visa application process can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces finding extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to announce tomorrow a find that will have implications for the search for life in space.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is announcing an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented by astrobiology experts tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington. It is a science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA pledged that it would present &quot;a startling find in the search for extraterrestrial life,&quot; prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that humanoid creatures can exist in hostile environments previously thought uninhabitable. It was hypothesized that these could transform into intelligent creatures - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. She lives there in an environment deemed too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is high in arsenic.
In some way, the microbe uses the arsenic as a resource for survival. Taking this ability into account increases the chances that there could be similar life on other planets that don&#39;t have our protective atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologists, when these organisms metabolize arsenic, it is demonstrated that &quot;there actually is another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know.&quot;
The space agency will announce the actual range of its find at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
Attending the conference will be geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (Saturn&#39;s largest moon) and wondered if its chemical makeup is similar to Earth&#39;s , educated.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
They complain that the two-party system will be introduced with the reform of the organic law on the Congress.
The 60th legislative period had just begun and an opposition bloc was already being installed, led by MPs from the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who introduced himself as an independent. The four questioned: the entry of the &#39;two-party system&#39; into the Chamber.
Before the inaugural session of the 60th legislature began, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the organic law as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they reiterated, a &#39;bipartisan system&#39; would be introduced, for now there would be two people, the same number as parties, controlling Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency led by panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political marginalization with these reforms.
He said they would talk to PAN and PRI representatives in the next few days to change the scheme. They acted on their political will, and if they didn&#39;t have it, they would be subjugated again by both parties, bringing an end to the opposition coalition.
&quot;I&#39;ve come this far (the opposition coalition), that&#39;s what I see, because we&#39;re excluded from all decisions, they don&#39;t even bother to consider the opinions of the others.&quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia explained that there are points of agreement with the PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group is being formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be &quot;duopolistic&quot;.
&quot;It is not in the spirit of law reform that Congress should be perpetually bipartisan.&quot;
&quot;For starters, this group will start with five MEPs and they will talk to more colleagues to increase,&quot; explained the Convergencia member.
The PT&#39;s Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, alluding to PAN and PRI, said Congress has now turned into a &#39;prey for two&#39;.
&quot;Before it was just one party, now they split it in two.&quot;
Patrón Montalvo requested that MEPs be respected and given their place at the negotiating tables.
&quot;There must not be left out five, who will probably be nine MEPs, because of top decisions. The five, who are currently seen as split into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because due to he reform that was carried out and agreed by the others, we stayed out and we do not agree with this reform.&quot;
200,000 pesos more for &quot;the delivery lady&quot;
The city of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the electronics company.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was written by the city government in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Government&#39;s transparency page, this check, numbered 9258447, for the amount of 200,144.56 pesos, was issued last November 16 for the purpose of &quot;account settlement.&quot;
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the municipality would go to this supplier. It is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and consequently the number of checks still to be written in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
&quot;Nothing was bought from her, they just pay the debts, just like the other suppliers,&quot; he said in an interview.
The last checks &quot;reappeared&quot; in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, two from October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and this last one from November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Gazette, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again would be taken.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25th the verification of the checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to July 9th, 2010 during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality Paid over 10 million pesos to Camacho Palazuelos in 42 checks.
Deals also took place with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places are in dire need of improvement
Tourism companies regret the foreign tourist&#39;s accident due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada collapse, the Mazatlán tourism industry asked the authorities to pay special attention to areas that are in poor condition and reflect badly on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Merchants&#39; Association, recalled that on various occasions there have been calls to take care of the destination and transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new job opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had a negative impact, with tourists coming to stroll and see the clutter, prompting them to turn their backs on nearby shops.
&quot;Politicians don&#39;t know what it means to have to close down a company one day and they don&#39;t worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be doing the construction work in this slow and haphazard way.&quot;
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist&#39;s fall drew attention to the city&#39;s lack of prevention and maintenance work.
&quot;The community needs to take responsibility and avoid something like this happening again. How to do that? Well, by doing preventive maintenance instead of fixing everything after the fact,&quot; he explained.
&quot;We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Not only because it is a tourist area does it need to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean place to live. The city government needs to change its strategy to ensure that to keep the city in good condition.&quot;
&quot;There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished,&quot; he said, &quot;like el Escudo y el Venadito in Mazatlán.&quot;
&quot;Nowadays we need more than advertising to attract tourists. We need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and tourist attractions constantly maintained,&quot; he added.
&quot;Not enough attention has been paid to these precautions and these types of incidents expose what is obvious to all: an urgent need for maintenance.&quot;
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving Mazatlán&#39;s tourist sites, which are misused and create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that needed updating along with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
&quot;Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive to tourists and add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chair of the CCE, suggested that MPs should shoulder the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán&#39;s business community is demanding a dignified parliament, free from collusion between parties and the government, as Sinaloa is troubled and facing serious problems.
The 60th Parliament was inaugurated yesterday. It is made up of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and another one from PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to be committed to society and to the diverse social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the Business Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new MPs should shoulder the heavy responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
&quot;We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act free from party collusion, because it is common for them to reach agreements in which they represent their own interests, thereby becoming carnival extras of those in power and the leaders of the transform parliamentary factions.&quot;
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the bridges needed to support the current government.
&quot;We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, that they work for the community and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who put their trust in them in the last election.&quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, says that one of the major challenges facing the 40 MPs is to drive and work together for the state&#39;s economic growth, given that today&#39;s economic situation is extremely complicated.
&quot;The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation.&quot;
With regard to the tourism industry, he urged the new MPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the state budget to promote it.
&quot;I understood that it is the ministry with the second least resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with agro-industry.&quot;
Funds need to be allocated to tourism projects, state security needs to be supported, and the Alcohol Act, which has not been revised in previous legislatures, needs to be updated.
Holy King wanted
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Epiphany, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a billy goat.
Despite this, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live hand to mouth as their father does not have a steady job.
&quot;Sometimes it&#39;s hard times because my husband doesn&#39;t have a job. But we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out on the street with the brats to sell,&quot; said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the little ones&#39; mother.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting a &#39;monster wagon&#39; for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests one-year-old-size clothes.
&quot; (José Alfredo) told me &#39;I would love to have this monster&#39;, but I said to him, &#39;let&#39;s wait, boy&#39; because it was very expensive,&quot; Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is a size 12; 10-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while 8-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can take part in the &#39;Holy King Wanted&#39; campaign by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, around ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that are said to have served primarily for drug production.
&quot;Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used in production have been confiscated,&quot; said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are from Sherbrooke, among the men believed to be the main masterminds of the drug ring.
The arrested persons reportedly appeared outside the Sherbrooke Courthouse hours after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing cannabis, possessing it for sale, conspiracy and providing services of crime, among other things.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that lasted more than a year.
&quot;The information obtained from the public authorities enabled us to carry out these arrests,&quot; specified M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Quebec Regional Investigation Unit Estrien, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
The clandestine immigration could easily be traced
The Conservatives&#39; bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships laden with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be scrapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not back the proposal.
&quot;I strongly oppose this charter.&quot;
&quot;I stand with a party that has put shackles on your feet,&quot; explained Michael Ignatiev, head of the Liberal Party, to the assembled MPs after the weekly caucus session.
Liberals have said the proposed law, which would allow anyone disembarking from a seagoing vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates Canada&#39;s rule of law and liberties as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he would not be able to support the bill because it was aimed at the wrong target group.
&quot;We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does,&quot; declared M. Duceppe.
Criticism on the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed critics who say her party is not firm enough on clandestine immigrants.
&quot;The neo-Democrats agree that action should be taken against the stowaways, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do through mediation in another bill, the C-35,&quot; Chow said.
So we don&#39;t support the Conservative bill because it blames the refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year,&quot; Chow said.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
&quot;Canadians are urging MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, this criminal activity that affects Canada and treats the country like a doormat.&quot;
&quot;They expect Canada to take tough action,&quot; was Secretary Kenney&#39;s response.
&quot;The government has not announced any confidence vote on its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, one Conservative has told QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that any MP who opposes it can explain itself to its electorate immediately.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite Jean Charest&#39;s announcement of the possible creation of a new permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry into the issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Safety, claims that the idea is not yesterday&#39;s: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Still, Wednesday&#39;s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at all at the meeting of the Quebec Police Service Standing Committee on October 29 last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, did not fail to describe this announcement in terms of public security as &quot;a rabbit pulled out of a hat&quot; and &quot;a solution cobbled together at the end of a table&quot;.
For his part, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power is having too much impact on the future entity in question.
&quot;You will see the result when we announce it,&quot; he was content to affirm.
&quot;People are aware of this problem.&quot;
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
&quot;The more M. Charest insists on preventing this committee of inquiry from being formed, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide,&quot; he said.
&quot;The only way to set up a committee of inquiry is for Jean Charest to resign,&quot; said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at ENA.
To break this impasse, he proposes that Quebec give the Audit Inspectorate a special mandate to investigate corruption and collusion.
&quot;One should be able to expand the mandate of audit control,&quot; he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give audit control the same powers as commissioners, which would also allow them to force people to testify.
The formation of a permanent entity is not the only project on the drawing board of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request comes from the chief prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the justice minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
For his part, Vic Toews, Secretary of State for Public Safety, confirmed that his colleague from the Judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments affecting this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected motorcycle police squads, 131 people were arrested, although the Penal Code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the Anti-Mobsterism Act.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several river courses remain under strict surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has poured down some regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred in Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rain poured down on several regions.
Depending on the region, between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected here by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were hardest hit.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain had fallen here.
Since the snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, has to be added to this precipitation, it is feared that several watercourses will be overflowed.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by Quebec&#39;s security service about the flood alert affecting the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river courses in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière, are the objects of flood monitoring here and will continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rains caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an alternative bridge was torn down due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and is closely monitoring the situation, according to Security Councilor Annik Bouchard.
For its part, the Quebec National Flood Center issued Wednesday warnings of the sharp rise of several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont rebuked in part
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before Canada&#39;s Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about welfare and Haitians, as well as his abusive language over the air.
CCNR maintains that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinions, certain statements &quot;contained inaccurate information about welfare and unjustifiably negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such uncouth language that which is not appropriate to the programs broadcast during the day.&quot;
The board also concluded that a discussion of suicide that involved the disclosure of the names of two people who committed suicide violated the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the programs aired in 2008 and 2010.
The first injunction was filed following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts given in the program were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
Regarding the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had taken the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the board members had concluded that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
&quot;The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the episodes in question of the program &quot;Dupont le midi&quot; would have touched on a sensitive subject in a family-friendly and appropriate manner.&quot;
Therefore, he was not charged with any reproach against his person.
The final point of contention concerned the statements made about the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in a media-effective dispute that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator explained that he had not made a donation to help Haiti, because it was not known with certainty whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Board believes that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unfairly negative portrayal of Haitians.
&quot;I&#39;ve already served my three-day suspension in this matter.&quot;
&quot;My file has been virgin for a year and a half,&quot; the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of uncouth language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer acted &quot;beyond his obligations&quot;.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, was supposed to announce its decisions once during prime time within a period of three days, are minor.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montrealer of Algerian origin, has embarked on a very special course.
The athlete, who excels at &quot;sanda&quot; (full contact kung fu), kickboxing and thai boxing, now mounts the tatami and boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
&quot;I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago,&quot; explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I look for combat everywhere because for those who don&#39;t like ground fighting as presented in mixed martial arts, competition in North America is scarce.&quot;
The security guard employed by UPS recently broke bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals from World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) won.
&quot;I got the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai boxing,&quot; he explained.
&quot;At the moment I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China.&quot;
&quot;The fighters who had placed in the top four at the last world championships were invited from each category.&quot;
&quot;I got bronze in Toronto in 2009.&quot;
&quot;In 2005 I finished eighth in Vietnam.&quot;
&quot;In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in Toronto 2009 I was third,&quot; he added.
&quot;It&#39;s worth noting that I&#39;ve made progress in every competition.&quot;
&quot;With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!&quot;
&quot;San Shou&quot; or &quot;Sanda&quot; are disciplines originating in China, in which punches and kicks as well as ground throws are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer to emerge from this type of martial art is American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, who is well known in the martial arts world.
Should Nacer Zemmal reserve just one event in his career, it would certainly be his presence at the King of Sanda Super Bowl, the Super Bowl of kung fu.
&quot;This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China,&quot; explained the likeable pounder.
&quot;It&#39;s a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).&quot;
&quot;It was a super experience.&quot;
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
&quot;The one who beat me was a real professional,&quot; he analyzed.
&quot;There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).&quot;
&quot;The winners of the semi-finals meet in the final of their category.&quot;
&quot;Then the winners of each category join forces to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.&quot;
450 million in non-tender contracts
Hydro-Québec has mutually approved $450 million in contracts for project design firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, dubbed &quot;Énergie gérance,&quot; was formed in 2004 as a concomitant of Hydro-Québec&#39;s decision to turn over to the private sector its responsibility for this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the &quot;Énergie gérance&quot; consortium got hold of the lucrative contract without there having been a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem, with the risk of forcing competition and increasing prices.
&quot;This is a new kind of framed game and debilitates the competition.&quot;
&quot;This means that instead of playing pre-arranged games, they are now being played in an open way, instead of in a secret way,&quot; said PQ MP Sylvain Simard at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the issue in front of the National Assembly, because he finds it difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau reacted in the afternoon by vehemently denying that the contract was a set-up.
&quot;I&#39;m staying true to my line,&quot; she fumed, affirming that the PQ had acted &quot;dishonestly&quot; and &quot;lacked toughness.&quot;
She said it &quot;is the least&quot; that the PQ apologize.
The consortium model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid on a complex project.
The &quot;Eastmain&quot; project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is ongoing and should be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competitive struggle having been able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer exceptional, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; noted last week, the consortium&#39;s model applied in the field of civil engineering and consultancy is the subject of government investigations.
A quick scan of the Quebec business register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be enduring.
In this way, for example, the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or even Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
Regarding the &quot;Energie gérance&quot; consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that &quot;the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labor force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s&quot;.
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d&#39;énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that sniffed at the fact that the project management contract was granted by accord.
&quot;If you put out a bid and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket.&quot;
&quot;So you have two options: either you take the people who are at this mart and say to yourself: they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.&quot;
&quot;But the idea is that it&#39;s not the price that counts, it&#39;s the expertise of the people,&quot; Laporte said.
This contract, awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium, is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received from the Parti Québécois.
Contracts have been approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After checking, the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; counted more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had snatched up 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting their participation in &quot;Energie gérance&quot;.
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with &quot;Énergie gérance&quot; for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were &quot;well known to the Liberal Party of Québec&quot;.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally linked to the companies it &quot;financed&quot; before specifying that it was more about their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The &quot;green&quot; label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but outright skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key players in sustainable growth, but neither in the brands labeled or the eco-labels that are supposed to guide their choices.
It is a pity, although bathing in a media universe teeming with information in favor of more responsible consumption: the Responsible Consumption Barometer complains of a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that, like the first, is proving to be a brake on its commitment Reading showed that was held yesterday.
Despite driving consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to give little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that they really don&#39;t believe companies&#39; commitment to the environment any more than they do green company advertising, according to the measuring instrument devised by the responsible consumer center at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally friendly, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the politicians&#39; discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption nonetheless seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently stimulated by approximately only one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the reported performance of the green products and services that efforts are being made to provide them.
According to another report, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to the Barometer, 61% had also favored shopping from local merchants and favored buying locally grown food.
Greener and more responsible - the index of green consumption had reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its footprint on the environment by he takes care of animal welfare.
However, according to the barometer, social and ecological awareness seems to stop at cars: just 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or preferred carpooling in 2010 to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of respondents in this comprehensive behavioral survey that feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, asked by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, has agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, which belonged to Daniel Langlois, in order to hand it over to its actual cinematic function again, apparently did not receive it what they asked for.
The government has accepted to be involved, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond for a smaller amount than initially hoped for, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to government rumor mill sources.
A first plan of action and a request for 12.8 million were rejected by Quebec last spring, and the request has since been revised downwards again.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the &quot;Société de développement des entreprises culturelles&quot; (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he had sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet&#39;s counter-proposal was submitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31st to reply to this one.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been sidelined.
Recall that Quebec&#39;s cinema and complex owners&#39; association opposed direct government investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Education had no financial support to provide for real estate projects there that he did not sent to other cinemas.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment sued for substantial economic assistance.
Cinema boss Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex with great difficulty for more than ten years after the self-financed construction of the cinema, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of screens showing independent films is all too evident in Montreal, and eXcentris has been able to keep its clientele engaged.
For their part, Société Angus and Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are embarking on a privately funded campaign that they hope will raise $700,000 to spur the acquisition.
Since Spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois &quot;Des hommes et des dieux&quot;.
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not withdrawn the newspaper &quot;Le Devoir&quot; and what he and his group think of the revised proposals made to them have been ignored.
Mystery of complex-shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic leads leaked by WikiLeaks unravel the mystery of what the United Nations considers Canadians&#39; inferiority complex to Americans; but with the same blow they reveal the latter&#39;s feeling of superiority over Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that Canadian voters did not vote with Canada-US relations in mind, and believe that President Obama&#39;s visit would have helped the conservative government pass its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly leaked yesterday, offer more juicy details than the mere substantive content to nibble on.
A link dated September 22, 2008, when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports the point at which the United Nations ceases to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers several possible explanations for this situation.
&quot;An inferiority complex almost inherent in Canadians may make Canadian political leaders much more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to pass the buck on the United States in this election (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)&quot; that&#39;s how he describes it.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus &quot;the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of&quot;.
The ambassador understands this &quot;deafening silence&quot; all the less because the two countries have close political and economic ties.
&quot;Logically,&quot; he says, &quot;it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and even more so a party leader to have such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor when voting.&quot;
The other expression of this sense of importance reads the January 22, 2009 note sent by Ottawa Charge d&#39;Affaires Terry Breese to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
&quot;Your trip will help ensure the government&#39;s survival at the federal budget vote of confidence in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade on a $30-$40 billion stimulus program came about,&quot; describes Breese.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had had to adjourn the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the coalition from overthrowing parliament and the consequent survival of the opposition parties affecting the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Another statement, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image of the United States being conveyed by CBC drama series.
The ambassador is troubled by shows like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which all feature unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the &quot;No-Fly-List&quot; or even transfers for interrogations conducted by CIA musclemen can.
Yet another release details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner is said to have answered the question in the affirmative, but on the basis of an individual &quot;case by case&quot; decision.
At the end of the meeting, he is described as &quot;handing the Secretary of State a paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.&quot;
&quot;The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again.&quot;
Finally, let&#39;s note that tempers are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a senior adviser very close to Stephen Harper, had told CBC that those responsible for the massive leak should be &quot;killed&quot;.
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global lighting renewal plan
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew home, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (CFC) reduction equivalent to nearly a third of the additional reduction needed to achieve stabilize the Earth&#39;s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in step with the concrete large-scale projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFCs emitted to the earth as a result of lighting would be avoided if the incandescent bulbs, which so far still represent a 50 to 70% monopoly on the market, would be avoided , would be replaced by fluorescent ones or, even better, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the global vehicle fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, one would have to subtract 5 Gt from this balance in order to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius between now and 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by a factor of two.
The CFL bulbs last between 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company, by the way, took part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an indication of the savings potential of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a rheostat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that CFL bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the producers provide a collection point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the CFL bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the gains each country would make thanks to this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year on purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants that would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the results of Ivory Coast&#39;s presidential election to be published &quot;immediately&quot; as soon as the deadline expires.
&quot;The Secretary-General underscores the need for the independent electoral commission to continue its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay,&quot; said a spokesman for the UN chief.
&quot;He asks all parties and institutions in Ivory Coast to show their responsibilities and to refrain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced.&quot;
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had missed the deadline set for midnight Wednesday, three days after Sunday&#39;s election, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the commission would &quot;proceed with work&quot; to announce the results.
On Wednesday there were multiple calls from around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to annul &quot;fraudulent&quot; votes cast in the north, obtained by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the September 2002 failed coup.
Pascal Affi N&#39;Guessan, head of Ivory Coast&#39;s presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN&#39;s maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president&#39;s supporters from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are considered by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo&#39;s opponents now believe that the country&#39;s highest court is not neutral as it is headed by Paul Yao N&#39;Dré, a political figure closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has called the delay in announcing the election results &quot;unacceptable&quot; and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he did not go so far as to call for victory .
His allies reiterate that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
Sunday&#39;s second round of presidential elections were held to cap the process of unification and reconciliation in a country that had been divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had emerged as the lead candidate in the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the vote versus 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labor Office (ILO), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee became.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
Second quarter data was 9.3% of the metropolitan working age population and 9.7% including overseas departments.
For the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers in metropolitan France were unemployed in the third quarter but wished to find work; This included whether they were able to work every two weeks or not and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labor market has seen an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with inclusion the overseas regions, continued to deteriorate.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of those aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the ILO.
For their part, the elderly registered a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), ie 482 000 of those over 50 years old, 6.6% under Involvement of overseas departments.
Only those aged 25-49 benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in metropolitan (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute about its calculation method, the Federal Statistical Office in Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to use this method and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments), compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of a waste management company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, has been investigated and imprisoned in Luynes close to a criminal investigation into the public and suspected fraudulent markets Delivered to Aix en Provence.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of company assets, misappropriation of public property, receiving stolen goods, complicity in corruption, tortious bribery and possession of arms, according to his lawyer.
&quot;Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to respond to any questions that the prosecutor will ask him, rather than spouting fantasies.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s easy to accuse him of a series of criminal charges, it&#39;s another thing to prove them,&quot; his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client&#39;s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the leading member of the Socialist Party in the department, had made it a point to send the judge, through his lawyers, a memorandum of justification before his hearing.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he was responsible for running, running.
According to Simon, he would never have known about the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former general manager of the public service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
&quot;My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of.&quot;
&quot;The chief prosecutor took into account not to deprive him of his liberty,&quot; said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released overnight, including two under judicial supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy manager of the waste management company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for &quot;tampering and passive bribery&quot;.
Two civil servants from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on charges of &quot;evasion and misappropriation of public property by a public officer&quot;, the other on &quot;complicity in misappropriation of public funds&quot;.
Alexandre Guérini&#39;s partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with &quot;stolen goods and embezzlement of company assets&quot;.
Among those confronted by Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar public fraud affair that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of having contributed to laundering money originating from &quot;high&quot; criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, here in particular in the waste disposal branch, was conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
According to sources close to the investigator, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the award and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also receives waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille Urban Basin (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its role as mediator for Syria
In the space of more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for &quot;espionage,&quot; kept French public in suspense, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful gaze of United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; reveal some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to advise them on how to deal with their own crisis of &quot;hostage taking&quot; in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman does not mean the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held captive in France and wanted by the American judiciary for trafficking in material to support Iran&#39;s nuclear program have in return.
Finally, they expose the manner in which the French presidency has attempted to manipulate the media to make them believe the idea that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss a bright light.
In truth, he had done nothing in that regard.
A diplomatic telegram redacted in Paris on August 12, 2009 is entitled &quot;Iran: French comments on the way hostage-taking is handled&quot;.
François Richier, Elysée Strategic Adviser, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d&#39;Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, spoke to American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to repatriate their own nationals who were being forcibly held in Iran.
&quot;Make noise,&quot; they said, &quot;articulate loud and clear and without ceasing&quot; the words &quot;basic human rights,&quot; &quot;innocence,&quot; &quot;immediate release&quot; in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
&quot;Do this all the more since the Iranians are asking you not to do it.&quot;
Because &quot;silence solves nothing&quot;, over the discussion attempts about inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are &quot;masters of evasive maneuvers&quot;.
Mr. Richier adds that arresting foreigners is a &quot;common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail.&quot;
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was supposed to come about on August 16, the day she took refuge in the French embassy) &quot;requires a large sum of money to be paid to the Iranians&quot; (230,000 euros Deposit).
And he says the Elysée anticipates more hostage-taking, a phenomenon that &quot;will intensify.&quot;
The Iranians &quot;may arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future,&quot; he said.
Aug 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago but is still being held in Iran.
Information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is wondering about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking Iran&#39;s illegal networks of acquiring materials earmarked for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
During another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier affirmed that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only &quot;completely surprised by the judge&#39;s decision,&quot; but also tried to oppose it.
&quot;There have been lively exchanges between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice&quot; (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but &quot;the French government cannot change the judicial decision,&quot; he explains.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under &quot;strict&quot; surveillance by French intelligence.
The Elysée adviser dials a number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian &quot;is currently in the buildings managed by the Iranian embassy in Paris.&quot;
During Clotilde Reiss&#39; detention in Iran, the Elysée did not spare its efforts, through statements and &quot;escape attempts&quot; organized by the media, to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad was playing an &quot;important&quot; and &quot;influential role as a mediator&quot;.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, noting that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 conjures up &quot;the media blitz by the French authorities&quot;.
What is the basis of so much &quot;thank you&quot; to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
&quot;Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.&quot;
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts &quot;are aimed at confirming Sarkozy&#39;s policy of opening up to Syria,&quot; he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008 that at the time &quot;was perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved&quot;.
&quot;Blending up on the Syrian role,&quot; Paris is &quot;trying to show Syria what credit can be gained by playing a constructive role in the region.&quot;
The aim is also to &quot;sow discord between Syria and Iran&quot;.
The American Embassy knows this well.
On August 11, François Richier confided in her: &quot;Of course we don&#39;t know if the Syrians did anything&quot;.
&quot;But we thanked them despite everything.&quot;
&quot;This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.&quot;
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes you to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their &quot;active role in the release of our compatriot&quot;.
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law dubbed &quot;the Cinderella&quot; that will ban youth from playing online games after midnight by barring them from access, government officials have indicated.
A bill that would require online gaming operators to ban young people under the age of 16 from playing these games after midnight will be brought to parliament in December, officials from culture and family ministries said.
&quot;Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and even living normal lives during the day.&quot;
&quot;We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep,&quot; said Jo Rin, Ministerial Envoy of the French press agency Agence France Presse in charge of this draft law.
The online games will then be accessible again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for accessing these games for those youngsters whose parents ask, the official added.
He will also make free programs available to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most &quot;connected&quot; countries, and newspapers regularly report various events related to intensive internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
In a frenzy over suspicions of corruption, FIFA&#39;s Executive Committee will on Thursday nominate the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which wrangling for influence and lobbying threatens to overshadow technical criteria.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA&#39;s supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Federation, after debuting on the African continent in 2010, hopes to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) or pursue its presence in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment to a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA&#39;s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not matter as much to the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which spearheaded the revelations by instigating the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), might as well have ruined the chances for their own country, cradle of football, which has only once won the was allowed to host the World Cup, namely in 1966.
The BBC gave fresh impetus to this on Monday by broadcasting a documentary attacking three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to anger FIFA and embarrass those in charge of England, who have been lobbying primarily David Cameron over the past few weeks.
The head of government is hoping for a repeat of the move made by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to organize the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
Would this intense effort be enough to re-elevate England&#39;s image before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack trumps with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which has become an important outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the committee members&#39; outright references to accusations by the English press of &quot;unfair competition in the preparation of the vote&quot;.
&quot;You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them,&quot; Putin fumed.
For 2022, the United States, bolstered by the experience of 1994, seems the logical favorite.
First world economic powerhouse, home of FIFA&#39;s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that helped organize the 2002 competitions.
Another threat: FIFA&#39;s long-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, rendering Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar pulling out all the stops in anticipating futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion into new territories, but these two countries pose more of a risk than a certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time difference) acquired by European countries, FIFA&#39;s sensitive nerve.
Second mandate: obviousness
De Gaulle was really taken aback.
Mitterand had let people believe that he was taken aback.
Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn&#39;t show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than these.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery attached to the presidency does not befitting.
So you have to act as if the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac&#39;s supporters pretended that a third mandate was not out of the question, without believing in it themselves.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision &quot;sometime in the autumn of 2011&quot;.
The fact that he would raise the prospect of &quot;two mandates&quot; in front of the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in the Elysée had spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not even close.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
&quot;You have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best,&quot; he told them in July 2009.
On a May 2010 update: &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not thinking about the aftermath.&quot;
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they provoke comments, it is for two reasons.
Accelerating the race for candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS urge to declare war earlier than expected.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon&#39;s candidacy to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44% according to the BVA-L&#39;Express poll).
&quot;We have a candidate and there are no discussions with the UMP about it,&quot; reacted immediately and cautiously those close to the prime minister.
&quot;If he thought defeat was a possibility, he wouldn&#39;t be a candidate,&quot; said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
&quot;He will always believe that he can win,&quot; corrects Alain Juppé, who has accepted the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB&#39;s Central Bank Governing Council last year should provide an opportunity to outline ways of exiting the crisis, or at least announce the ordering of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be concluded by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt, without a doubt, to forfeit even today&#39;s more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause them to deteriorate.
The political costs involved would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB&#39;s active role in solving Europe&#39;s national budget debt.
She didn&#39;t dare say if she thought the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its government bond-buying program.
&quot;I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) &quot;.
The day before in Brussels, Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, was not very eloquent about his plans, but was content to point out that the program of purchasing government securities would &quot;continue to operate&quot; in the secondary market and that we will &quot;see how the decisions come out&quot; at Thursday&#39;s meeting.
The only certainty: the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury&#39;s bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to around 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions from some traders, it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds yesterday.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases totaling 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders anticipating a follow-up to the buy price (see page 29).
Economists are no longer expecting any notable change in course.
When the bond deals of more than three months are already gone from the ECB&#39;s arsenal, the latter will still tamper with the unrestricted cash reserves in a liberal manner, for a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already preparing for the fact that this measure will be extended by a few more months.
&quot;I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its program in any significant way.&quot;
&quot;Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,&quot; suspects Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
&quot;A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me,&quot; anticipates Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
As for its interventions in the sovereign debt market, &quot;the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases as will stimulate the sluggish market,&quot; adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of European banks&#39; exposed position in eurozone sovereign debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
&quot;It must take the place of the lacking investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent hasty enthusiasm about the yields being paid to the weakest states,&quot; testified a key bondholder yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to soar, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is running for cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the fall in base interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Economy Minister, regional leaders Giulio Tremonti described the situation as &quot;indecipherable&quot; and heard him anticipate an &quot;unpredictable&quot; weekend, which the person concerned immediately denied.
In any case, on Tuesday the gap in German interest rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the prices of contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
At his Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that the discrepancy between Spain and German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as &quot;very concerned&quot; about the &quot;market turbulence&quot; and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
&quot;The good news is that Italy, the eurozone&#39;s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.&quot;
&quot;The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,&quot; said Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the consequent dwindling tax receipts that put the state at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italy is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget under review by the Senate projects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7 %).
Hence the uproar over a new household collective that could be deployed after the holidays to the tune of 7 billion euros.
&quot;If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken,&quot; says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment Italy receives the support of international institutions.
&quot;The fundamentals of Italy&#39;s economy are in order and its accounts are in order, we&#39;ve been repeating that for a long time,&quot; said Arrigo Sadun, the International Monetary Fund&#39;s Italian trustee in charge of Italy at the IMF.
&quot;At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since Italy, despite its high level of debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, ed.), is required to make less progress on stabilization than other countries &#39; observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The question of political discontinuity remains.
On December 14th, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, which could mean that early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
It is therefore an unfavorable period for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde expressly emphasized it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: &quot;I think it was still proven on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: the Europeans are clearly sticking together, are ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.&quot; .
Although entirely relative, yesterday&#39;s drop in European government bond yields was grist to the mills of governments and the ECB alike.
However, there can be no talk of a start to normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s had announced that it could downgrade Portugal&#39;s debt rating, arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
&quot;As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly heavily on the banking systems,&quot; say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since &quot;political time passes much more slowly than that of the markets&quot;.
The European countries, well aware both of this gap and of the danger it conceals, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and more broadly with their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
And this also in view of the Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda is the lot of unconventional measures to back Eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Funds, their Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asian tour in Singapore on Tuesday to brief investors in the Far East on the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not expressly fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for this.
The first securities issues from the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States supports a possible increase in funds mobilized through the additional, direct involvement of the IMF.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the countries at the forefront, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labor market organisation.
Reforms that come on top of the austerity measures but are expected to have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are following a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are keen to avoid, at all costs, having to ask for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budgetary corrections and decided on the structural reforms that are essential and that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European lenders, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalizing government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was in Paris on November 24th, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to return to the to grab your own pocket.
Economists at Barclays Capital, the front runner in the European sovereign debt market, say an extension of around €100bn would be sufficient, &quot;preferably&quot; in the form of a direct cash injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilization, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has every chance of being studied closely in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
The snow episodes are still causing transport difficulties, particularly on Brittany&#39;s secondary transport networks, and threatening to disrupt various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on Orange Alert due to the impending risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, in places 7 to 10 cm, is expected, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d&#39;Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions are affected.
The snowfall will be significant enough to cause traffic delays and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d&#39;Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation on the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using your own vehicle only in emergencies, and the use of some TER coaches has been canceled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were planned for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture &quot;urges motorists to exercise extreme caution on the roads and to adjust their driving behavior accordingly.&quot;
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) on Thursday asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris&#39; Roissy airport and 10% of those departing from Orly due to expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
South London&#39;s Gatwick Airport and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, one recalls the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend on the markets part of the financial sum at double it.
The first projections were finally made today.
The 2010 Supplemental Budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly&#39;s Finance Committee, sets out the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
The measures involved are twofold: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de-France.
According to Article 15 of the draft law, the former goes &quot;in favor of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
This is quantified: &quot;The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year&quot;.
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: &quot;to modernize it, to increase the resulting product and to entrust this increase to the Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
How much would that fetch?
A mystery.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
We&#39;re a long way from 4 billion.
&quot;It is explained that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment that will be raised by the State and will be gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project,&quot; the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system objectionable at all.
&quot;From the moment you book the income (the two taxes, as a rule), you can cover the project for three years and only then draw from the 4 billion,&quot; it is explained.
&quot;This will be noted in the budget and gradually deducted&quot;.
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start writing down the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the promised 4 billion of which will be a long time coming, risks provoking a rather heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will take place on December 7th.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let&#39;s go in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the acknowledgment of the fact that any file produced by any intelligence agency (of any nation) consists entirely of newspaper clippings.
The &quot;extraordinary&quot; American revelations about Berlusconi&#39;s sexual habits throw up nothing more than what you&#39;ve been reading for months in any journal (except those owned by Berlusconi) and Gaddafi&#39;s chillingly caricatured profile has long provided cabaret artists with material for their skits.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers can only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library devoted to esoteric publications, you will find that each work (on the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what is already written in previous works became.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult think of nothing other than believe what they already know and validate what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown&#39;s mechanism for success.
Likewise the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or dull-witted) is the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, e.g. editor at Liberation), who only accepts as true what he admits.
The top-secret information on Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why was there such a fuss about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side these state what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can phone each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - perform their diplomatic function have lost and, with the exception of a few small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
Still, to repeat it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that any hacker can tap into the deepest secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow to the prestige of the Department of State.
In addition, the scandal does not bring the victims so much as the &quot;executioners&quot; in distress.
But let&#39;s get into the profound nature of what happened.
Back in Orwell&#39;s day, all power could be concentrated like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell&#39;s prophecy might have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where thanks to the phone one can control every movement, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But if you consider what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the patrol ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The Force controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen to be the citizen&#39;s avenger - can learn the mysteries of the force.
But how can a power survive that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is essentially a secret free of secret, since it reveals the public sphere; but to reveal, WikiLeaks-style, that Hillary Clinton&#39;s secrets were empty secrets is to strip her of all power.
WikiLeaks has wronged neither Sarkozy nor Merkel, but it has wronged Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a mighty power?
It&#39;s obvious that states will no longer post any reserved information online - that would be tantamount to a notice posted on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies it is futile to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has been on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships intended only for certain ears be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that my prediction sounds sci-fi and novel-like at the moment, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents secretly bustling along uncontrollable march routes, their communications nowhere but in mere memory carrying it with them and, moreover, hiding in the heel of their shoes the little written information they received.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate&#39;s espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology nowadays advances like a cancer: backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet recreates a wire (telephone) telegraph.
The (analogue) videocassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, rewinding from back to front and uncovering all the mysteries of the montage, while the (numerical) CDs today only allow you to jump from chapter to chapter , i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane it takes three and a half hours, including changes.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology are coming back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that are demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France sugarcoats its financial promises
A year on from the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the delivery of fast-paced funding promises (also called &quot;fast start&quot; or premature funding) implemented by developing countries.
And already the coarse French rhetoric has been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (ie 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to Fast Start funding: detailed progress report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, leaflet distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued precisely for its intrinsic value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same thing with the same level of precision.
The EU announces it released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to pay respect to its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But if you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money, according to the Copenhagen Accord, should be &quot;new and additional&quot; to ensure that an additional effort has been put in without being detrimental to Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what &quot;new and additional&quot; means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonization, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that they consider best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen the benchmark for 2009: international funding will be maintained and will add 150 million over three years as part of the &quot;Fast-Start&quot; funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or ODA level terms.
Conversely, France considered the 2010 financing of &quot;all new projects&quot; to be &quot;new and additional&quot;.
In other words, there are no benchmarks in the previous year&#39;s spending or at the global level of official development assistance.
More specifically, the total amount of French support to developing countries may remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to honor its commitment regarding &quot;new and additional&quot; financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, consider €1 borrowed to be equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain viable investments (often emission control projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro that one collects as the equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, it should only the cost of the loan to the lender country counts as an exposure (ie the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following reflection in mind: it &quot;respects&quot; its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros). ) - see also the EU document to see for yourself.
France is the only country in the EU that makes extensive use of loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) meet their commitments at 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet their commitments, France pays just 10 cents and sees it as a comparable bet.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France operates in its Fast Start financing with a double swindle: partly with an evolution of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make believe it has spent 420m &#39;new and additional&#39; million in line with its promises, saving 36.1m euros in the process.
The Treasury&#39;s manipulation (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries cannot be completely fooled...
The chapter on premature financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions about the climate.
But it could be a drop too many in the UNFCCC&#39;s immense machinery.
Let&#39;s hope this won&#39;t be the case.
Whatever the case, it&#39;s imperative to learn the lesson from this first year of premature funding.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance the debate on the issue of long-term financing (another crucial issue currently under discussion): there is no escaping the issue of &quot;settlement&quot; or the way in which its loans are accounted for.
France could change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other things.
So the hope rests on the new environment minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who is due to arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement of France&#39;s Fast-Start and its vision of &quot;clearance&quot; and the use of loans would inherently boost the international confidence needed for further discussion.
Alert - pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemical substances throughout the day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results &quot;given the small number of samples analyzed do not represent a statistically significant value, but are illustrative of the problem addressed&quot;, had between July and September, usually within four, by a child of around ten at mealtimes bought the food consumed plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five pieces of fresh fruit and fruit, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - have been studied, as well as sweets, by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate tally is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as definitely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
&quot;Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance ingested individually are not exceeded, this survey provides a very good indication of the reality of the consumer&#39;s possible exposure to carcinogenic or endocrine-disrupting substances is worrisome,&quot; notes the association.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three known to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can impair the endocrine system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, in which the study found traces of an insecticide that is strictly banned in the EU.
In addition, the ground beef, canned tuna, even the baguette and chewing gum were peppered with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the tap water.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the &quot;richest&quot; with 34 chemical residues found, and even the plastic plate used to reheat the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The ultimate risk of this &quot;toxic cocktail&quot; to consumers &quot;is likely to be underestimated,&quot; according to the study.
For its part, the &quot;Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts&quot; (EE-LV) has proposed &quot;given the urgency of the situation&quot; to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the &quot;increase in civilization diseases&quot;.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) related to the presence of residues had identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
