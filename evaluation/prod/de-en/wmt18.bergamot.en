Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An lunatic asylum, where young people are to meet today.
A chapel of the crypt, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Kleing gardeners cultivate the former ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It annoys when maps are not up to date.
Everyone who has ever had to get upset knows this because the car sat nav indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the Bavarian digital atlas, an offer from the Bavarian geoportal of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very revealing.
Especially if you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have been located in the distribution area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century. centuries have changed.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called primary position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originating from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French commander occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the War of the Coalition.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops with the peace of Lunéville from 9th. February 1801 finally withdrew: It was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern map.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek, like all others.
The comparison in the past/today is most impressive using the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is Untersendling, which still appears in the map of 1856, is relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a more small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces of land from the so-called "original view", from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but growers of the "Land in Sonne" plant.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in the 19th century. A century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, one reads not only the street name "on the Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt" in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen.
Yes, people with delusions were once locked up here on Auerfeldstraße.
In 1858/59 the Munich district-miceared organ "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established there.
From 1872 Dr. Bernard of Gudden the establishment - that psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"It was progressive for his time and, for example, finished chaining the so-called lunatics.
He has also forbidden staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working on the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients had been space, later there was an extension to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt young people meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football field of TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural style of the original building of the insane asylum, which had been destroyed during bomb attacks during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as "Haupt Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs were taking many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on the 5th edition of the company. The ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk line will take place on April 2017.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be compared.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colours has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is held until 28. To enter into force in August 2017, African-American travellers, visitors and Missouri calls for special attention to travel through the state and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, breed-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," says the group's statement.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it more difficult for people to win actions for discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately target minority minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the Missouri NAACP president, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also refers to a recent report by the Attorney General's office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be held than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People need to be willing, whether to bring it with it, or let the relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which gave the state in terms of the number of such violations on the 16. rank the rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach-based pasture fence project is a successful project and will continue next year.
The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on site.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local section met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holidaymakers in five apartments.
For him, the "Black Forest Milk" is the non-excurtner marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
Only regional things come on the table of holidaymakers.
Since he is also a BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the lime fence project as "elementaryly important".
I cannot profitably operate on such steep areas.
The grassland area ensures a lot of work, much must be worked on with the engine sense.
"We are struggling with the conditions and the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003 he took over the parental company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it did not run an organic farm.
It was clear to Mayor Thomas Schneider: "The municipality recognised the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy with the leader funding."
Farmers would have to be supported with costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.
One hoped that this could be used to reforepy the land for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticised because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the pasture fence mining.
The area of open space is thus 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half were promoted by leaders, and one quarter was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible."
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear that "the best food is produced here".
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor set designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be managed to sluggish (approximate more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation.
The application of eight participants with 24 plots who want to build just under 16 kilometres of fence is currently underway for the 2018 Fischerbach pasture fence.
The keeping area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdo's Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have rubbed him if he had done so.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller called Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the stirring up of Lazarus' words, the only ones in which a state invites not only ancient immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your troubles, your arms, your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely / the miserable falling away from your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "same waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's United States.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to placing their words at the base after their death - knew very well that she was doing a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this back long ago.
The great screaming neck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-conservative who brings the American flame to the nighted-over world: "Lady Liberty is making progress.
It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States."
Limbaugh has come across something quite unusual here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is truly a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain
The performance director of the UK athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and that the UK athletics has to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue to do it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: There has been something to do with what they did.
And also with the type on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are med candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in very natural were great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400 metres at their fifth World Championships at the 400 metres, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total athlete athlete at the World Championship was seven reached in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads along this path and set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"Being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special to me," she added.
"Obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will be a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sworn in criticism, safely.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said a lot of people.
But it is important.
And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming Democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very admitted to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debut his hairless head on his site after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the news programme "The Post."
"I also don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people comment on the same topic, then some people are disregarded as a so-called collective commitment and are not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
As the governor's staff referred to as a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "adpultal."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if one had done the same, that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what is happening digitally
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter clerks hit his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the UK overwhelmed his post, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are part of the foundation of our nation.
And true guidance means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will be the 25. Edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which last year led next door to the end round at Archerfield Links before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it reaches its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he determined that place.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he has won in his 32-year career both in the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels special," said the Southport-based player.
"I could not defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who after his 50th anniversary. Earlier this year this year, returns to the action on Heimatboden.
This event will be his first Scottish presence since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you feel this extra pressure too.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.
I am happy about how it has gone so."
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking lot costs 5 dollars per car with one occupant and 10 pounds per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer fatalities due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of second-hand smoke.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"Our estimates each year at 167 lung deaths are due to second-hand smoke," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this 1994 topic.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to second-hand smoke per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "are reasonably time," says Fred Heinze, head of the construction yard.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since a lot is hosted underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove.
It even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai residence in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken and swallowed up with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. B. Washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless space serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5 pm," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces by a public hand survey.
An existing movement, which moved in favour of independence against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car hire car ride.
There is no public transport.
The town with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs, which have been converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans adored a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this clothes," says Degei, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 dollars to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly treated.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region alone.
"We Will All Lose" says a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, which includes reports on atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rapes and electrical strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased because Papuans' resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
"The migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to Jayapura to work in the provincial capital, Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papuan - the mom mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, waiting for him to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On the 7th In December 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The shocked children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her clay and later came back with four soldiers, says local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their rifle buttons, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird's singing - of Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent an order about an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, including his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papuan police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "seak up" their ward because they were being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papuan police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings did not come 'filtered' by Jakarta until the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to tackle the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, security minister Wiranto said that he was introducing an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations, but there are processes that need to be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he had reached on the 5th. June in Jakarta spoke to TIME and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity," demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I am afraid of being arrested by the military is afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a man to hospital without consciousness, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people were quickly brought in here, says TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to account and withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, who claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by initiating sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM guides are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody, under the pretext of "settlement of national sovereignty".
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty is increasing dissatisfaction.
The little bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region are usually going to better-educated and prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asian deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's promises were not realized to remove the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies, and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on the 4th time. In May, locals broke their silence and harassed him, "We want freedom," according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, is in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard her voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never be entitled to justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'goal' skyscraper of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its book on Friday in one of the world's tallest residence towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second brand that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which is happened to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50. It says a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the firefighting units were extinguishing the fire around 4:00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing lodging to those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage caused by the panel, the exterior trim or insulation, came.
In the UK, the police said they believed that the system of panels for isolation and disguise at the London Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Further Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has fallen through the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup coup.
At the session in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning rates was not razor-thinally supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated, are therefore preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member states voted for the reform, and the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our membership nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," said Haggerty.
We will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not only been voted after many objections.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: the Davis Cup and Fed Cup finalists will be hosting the first round the following year.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements for training grounds, etc., and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings forbidden items to the plane, finds a survey
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously smuggled banned items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent entering the aircraft while accidentally carrying banned knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had travelled erroneously with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travellers are more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they had knowingly worn items with blades through security checkpoint, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers around the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling through the airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.
It is no surprise that people who most likely to wear smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were those who most often fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it is no surprise that the largest number of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electro-Thousands Elon Musk likes to give up with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far refrained from ensuring that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures for increasing sales and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time revealed another, less splendid number when announcing the latest quarterly balance: that of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has often promoted the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation Payment".
Currently, there were 45,000 such non-binding reservations, allowing Musk to analysts in a conference call.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets does not lie in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it is scheduled to be 500,000, in 2020 it will be 500,000, in 2020.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently available per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are greater delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of deceiving the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after 15 states was sued, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved to be more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental authorities.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous body in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline, which is held on 1. October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "to interfere in local decisions or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor's attorney before President Donald Trump's appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry resist.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPO administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its U-turn in ozone standards simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the time limits for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and to set the date for implementation in a settlement," said Pruitt, who made the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority we have seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its "right to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "are based on sound policies and the best information available".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that the EPO had sued this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPO's reversal - after our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives from the public health sector and the environmentalist cheered on Pruitt's surprising changes.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade to curry favour with polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the jubilee of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 October, July, at 4.30 pm invited to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
The visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made Tumlingen's friends and patrons their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267 the St. Hilarius' chapel was first mentioned in the documentary in the Württemberg documentary: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen with the pilgrim church with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the document, the wording of the document stood on the Tumlinger Berg in addition to the former parish church also alordmental court, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So people also lived there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the lower village and the upper village, which can be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the manorial settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built, equipped, equipped and occupied a parish priest, remained the owner of this church and was also able to inherit this church.
This was due to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger things of the two can be reached at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be surrendered in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Ceride farm also served as a final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower gnome, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentners" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility.
As the organizers, the friends and sponsors Tumlingens on Sunday, 16. July, to the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is shaped by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The head Hartmut Romann speaks the closing remarks.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen are particularly committed to the care of their homeland, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Verein wants to have the permission of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim is fighting for itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim is a forced manor" has called on district administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30. No wind turbines could have been approved in December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city limits of the Schwalm valley.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent "saving" of the landscape.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim nette - but this had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government, due to a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval notice granted is still illegal and therefore cancelled," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim is standing down".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law".
The district confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by Viersen circle since last week," a speaker explained.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to stop the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to express itself on Thursday on Thursday to the argumentation of the association "Boisheim is taking advantage".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area of the Boisheim nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11,400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-member households.
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district) on Friday morning at around 10 a.m.
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road was closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich ran towards the L 333 towards Bogel with her 53-year-old mother as a companion.
City and traders are planning "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city council want the weekend on 8th and 9th Use September to attract residents to shopping in the city centre.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced that the "Heima-Shoppen" weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers who offer their own city offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is therefore planned.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only targeted at residents of the city and the nearby region.
According to Christian König, commercials on the radio, are an Internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action, says Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The trade association and the city are thus entering another stage of the "Attractive city centre" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "active day" to the Brunnenfest including sales-open Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be new or reopened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revitalize the city center - up to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.
King had said that it was necessary to overcome the lethargy, which had partly spread, had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time in Germany's third "Heimat Shoppen" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and to highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action under the auspices of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence their own direct environment with their purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
Another new people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others have been injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) an injured person was still in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A person who was initially missing was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
The authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline as a cause of the accident.
At the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on leaked transcripts of telephone calls Mexico because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On the 27th January called on Trump in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US, and swore to have Mexico paid for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia is "ridiculous", "mies" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make it look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on refugee resettlement to the US.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: activists restore racist lynching as a call for justice
A 1948-based Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled at the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forth to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked testing through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Have him out of the car!"
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged by the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene is on the 22nd place. July was played, only one reenactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of them in the audience were very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to cope with the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcol and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It is really incomprehensible that not a single person has been arrested all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," Tyrone Brooks said, who helps with the reenculation organization.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A forensic doctor puts a sheetfed over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford-Lynchen on 27. July 1946.
According to FBI files received from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch Trial.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farm tenant Roger Malcolm, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, stabbed a woman during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On the 25th In July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it more even more concisely.
"It was a right-wing law massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, it will happen to you here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their presentation is vivid, poignant and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe no longer exist in America.
It is hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching, because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black ones - crowded into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said that the role would never become easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return at these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The piece starts with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and harasss him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs at the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think that white people said 'n --- he'.
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'r.'."
And it is precisely where energy shifts in the room, a feeling of camaradiness replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting it right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks in every second word.
About a hundred metres behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of sight.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the street.
They have experienced all Georgia's oppressive moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the burial sites of the Malcolms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that if you are standing in the same country where the Lynch murders were taking place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites you to get closer and inspect the bodies.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the breastfeeding body and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters like he wants to remember it.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then collapses in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair from Atlanta chats stimulated about the reensure with a black pair they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feeling of the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What really does this does to me make me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it is only called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks keeps court at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already begun to plan the performance next year.
"The reensure is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is like this, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, is doomed to repeat it."
"Götterdämmerung" reconcloned the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from the GDR era or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that parks an open Mercedes classic car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through its "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), pull a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood and give the rioto clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus oak) has to believe in it.
The audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is humbly celebrated and bows to the Merkel race.
There is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which is showing itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual clothes again.
The performance by Frank Castorf and his director team was eagerly awaited.
If he had to endure a whistling concert in 2013, there was five years later great cheers, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner was probably happy about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a certain way," she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of his view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have worked at the school on the open full day.
What are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years, a late-fought volunteer.
How does it come?
Quantity: I have completed my Abitur.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully broken off.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, to work with people.
And then I wondered what you are doing.
Take a social year, there is a glimpse, because you can see how it really is on site, in the focal point.
And was it?
Quantity: I have gathered great impressions.
I will start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker education in the Herne youth welfare office and study at the university in Hamm.
Is it not somewhat unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement homes to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that appealed to me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Other than in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, it is not a question of calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of you, who have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have fears of contact?
Quantity: I'm not the type.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Much love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts up another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
The job cut, which Director-General John Fallon was mostly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
In May, Pearson announced a third cost-cutting program in a third cost-cutting plan to save another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year had remained unchanged after an increase of 1% to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, said a statement by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh district in the incident.
The bombing is the last act of violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A Nato opinion states that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "managed improvised explosive device."
The statement says that all injured people are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On 31st May killed a huge bombing in the center of the city with more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since the US-led troops ousted the Taliban of power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the smog rule after actions
The US Environmental Protection Agency has repealed a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration, according to which states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions. This was one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to press ahead with the so-called "Ozone Provisions 2015" and said it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in the fact that we are responding to our state partners," said EPO head Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA's intention to delay the ozone provisions - which are to be measured in part of the country to identify pollutant emissions in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday, saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to shut down a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of major public-health emissions.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal council wants common room
In the end, the decision was clear: In two cases against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be until the community's area, which has been owned by the church congregation, there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be mastered by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a common area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square metres for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common room not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the senior-friendly living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of the "krope café" made the round.
The decision, which was already decided last autumn by providing funds for the ongoing budget, is satisfied by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the renovation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common room would be eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposed resolution provides for the proposal to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw clubs between his legs in this respect, the observation that both saddle - which is based on the ambient development - and a platform roof - which reduces the eaves and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, not only Wilfried Sohmer means, is this addition.
If it helps: Unanimously, it happens to the panel.
It is not so easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of their own buildings, with which one does not make real progress, but now lean out of the window at the common room, she says: "I am hard to do it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation.
She sees behind it a covert subsidy to the benefit of any wealth or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give a grant, but if there is a real equivalent, which is marketable in case of doubt, is the return speech.
Three supporters apply to the proposed proposal to suspend the proposed proposal.
This means that the original programme includes two votes against, which Stefan Haller summarizes in this way: "If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclists are hurled on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the way with his bike on the cycle path of the Black Trail from Hilden towards Hilden at 12.20 hrs.
The senior wanted to cross the roadway at the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car guide moving in the same direction granted him priority.
When the Langenfelder was sailing, he obviously did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He clashed with a car that steered a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was hurled on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retmergency wagon.
FC Bayern Munich has to do without David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the match crash against Dortmund.
FC Bayern is travelling to Dortmund for the first competitive match of the new season with staff worries.
The defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner is missing.
The staff concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be growing at cup winner Borussia Dortmund ahead of the Supercup on Saturday (8.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport).
Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in a duel with BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Munich residents Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five losses in the past six test games, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
This was not good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official competitive game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play smartly," said Ancelotti, who expects a "dangerous, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights attracts the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
In the resin, wander from star to star
The first "star path" in Germany is to be built in the Harz Mountains.
This is being planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
He connects nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to set up plates along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "good-accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why good mobile network reception plays a role in location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Path Train will be extended to include train.
"On the star path, the viewer learns a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, although it was much further away.
It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is and when it is best seen.
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg is the highest observatory in Northern Germany.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
The Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are clearly visible from there to the naked eye.
In the university city, there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the planetary path - on the initiative of the Göttingen Sponsorship Association Planetarium Since 2003.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set up exactly at a distance and scale of one billion in the same way.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 metres away, measures 70 centimetres.
The total distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometres.
While the light from Sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would last for another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate spaces in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Featherweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound for pound for pound list.
Garcia held out the right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a possible showdown between fighters would be the "perfect size".
"I am a former feather weight," Garcia reminded.
"I have risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
The fans demand that.
Let's give it to them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree on a date next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23. September.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him," Garcia said, later expressing his open talk to fighting with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was based on their own fight.
"This is the struggle that needs to be done.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction after a tyre station.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained lying on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial aid of the injured by the emergency service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then the traffic could be passed on the left lane at the scene of the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defence formation in Aue will score points after the start of the season against Braunschweig after the start of the season.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result, had not been the two goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were too much two goals, and we have to be even better attention in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the three-chain is to be further optimised.
And the lucky ones do not want to catch a goal after a free kick.
"For the future, no one will step on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better with the chain of three even after the experience in the preparation chain, than with the chain of four.
"I still don't know how we will be in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is certain of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the threesome chain in the threesomes on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we are in harmony even better and we don't afford so many playback mistakes when setting up."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know.
The performance could be okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we are standing there with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opening."
His coach did not want to know about it.
"I only assess the start of the season after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, only because the match of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped early because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, since they do not have a difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a favourite of ascent in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the centre-back of Fortuna.
The guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting in the finite (almost) finished stadium in Aue as a slight favourite on Sunday.
"It is nonsense that we are selling them away simply because we are entitled to get into the first six," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in the event of only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd place. Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to carry out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish migration authority (migration concerning) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now received the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31. July 2017 published.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results in recent months are consistent.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the figures are quite constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggesting that the person examined was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it stated that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that it would be 18 years old that year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
An opticulous is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used.
It is very uncertain to assess the biological age in this way.
If we cannot say it for sure, we should not pretend that we could," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is small.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full on plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-numbered concrete piece was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at present, it is going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the Road Division and Transport at the Freiburg Regional Council.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach, which were in need of renovation.
The end of construction is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, which is clad in red bunter sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now gone old.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red bunter sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven-ton so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fixture, which is also used as an operating route.
On Friday, a 2.20 metre wide bridge cap will be used on the southern part of the bridge.
The pedestrian walkway should then run.
The special thing about it is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach required a particular sensitivity.
Because there is also a fibre optic cable to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work by handleaf.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished.
For the bridges between the building courtyard building and the traterweiher towards Schramberg, the traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to the Lauterbach town of the village, the road is fully closed in the area of the bridge at the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Approximate protest at German potato salad
It does not happen so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the district council of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which shows the flag peacefully on this day, because the AfD invites the Gerolstein town hall Rondell to the "large election campaign opener" according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the federal election on 24. September forms, and the deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are on site just hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate them.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that is presented.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forums Eine Welt and one of the leading organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including an "Edu's German potato salad, which the AfD could also eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him with him.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, she shows presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he had tried such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked for in Daun, but received a rejection there, because there was not enough parking spaces available because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the roundel, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondelle forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
It does as well: at around 8 p.m. a ribbon provides entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, various speakers in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall, waiting for the lead candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy chairman Beatrix von Storch to make their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also tiny up there shortly after 9 pm.

Trombone meets trumpet
Listening to the Wolfacher trombonist Frederic Belli will be showing off again in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets the Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach plays as if in a new robe, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" is combined with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing mix into a fascinating total work of art.
This centrepiece of the programme was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'."
Probably the most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I have been dating.
Or do you think I played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived the dualism and believed it seriously.
So it has never confused or disabled me.
I just never liked being taken seriously."
Especially suffered from this, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but during school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I really felt attacked, frightened and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public."
West Virginia Governor announces that he will change the party
. West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced at a rally with President Trump on Thursday night that he would change the party.
Like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I am a democratic governor."
The rally burst into jubilation.
"Tomorrow, I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say that it is time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not endanger Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
In the meantime, the Republic National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "The change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of least legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC leader Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe Appreciates "honest" Russian Sorry for Doping Scandal
The world leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again.
Russia's athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics that his country's banishment from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry to "all athletes who were snatched gold and silver medals away at competitions".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress have been pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players at the World Championships in Athletics, which will start in London on Friday, after the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited coaches are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Merit act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar, North Hesse, around 1,000 people of the two people were thinking about in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the cause of the fall.
However, she described the two pilots who died as "the culnsiders of their field".
"We bow to this supreme sacrifice they have rendered on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa, Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a Bundeswehr watch tower to Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral service began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
These included Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mother guests lay down roses, their family were arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlar and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen.
Defence Minister von deryen described the perished soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced operations.
The staff captain had helped to set up the flight operation of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersach, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do it."
There was no doubt about the UN mission in Mali, Minister von der Leyen: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were taken out of the cathedral.
The Bundeswehr did not provide any information when and where they are buried.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor BjÃ3rn NÃ3rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, it was further stated in the notice.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also suspended the title of "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik had not received the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, explained the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will eventually be, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always flew the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult time in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said over the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was swaying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroen instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants swift elections
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, there was a talk of the dissolution of the parliament.
Before that, the surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP from her state parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-fold majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified their step by not nominating the 2018 election in their constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that he accept her.
This means that CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the state parliament, the SPD and the Green 68 seats in Lower Saxony.
Until now, the ratio has been reversed.
The new state parliament will be regular on the 14th century. January next year.
Thümmler said that the red-green state government now had to decide whether it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the state parliament decides to dissolve itself as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its way forward on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament will deprive the prime minister of charge and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally checked," said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed at your mouth if they are legally reasonably examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but somewhat curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a black-green pendant.
The Greens called on the return of their Landtag mandate.
"We naturally assume that she will return their state parliament mandate, which she has received via the green list of the country, with immediate effect," said the state chairwriters Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The chairwoman of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot trace this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green," wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil's decision to have the state parliament quickly re-elected.
The exit of Twesten costs the majority of red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician presents her personal interests before the welfare of the country in her hurt vanity and in her frustration," criticised SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is participating in this dirty play of intrigue and tries to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his deputy to Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twestening with personal career thinking that the result of the 2013 state election was distorted.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at that time, but the SPD and the Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Interview with Agriculture Ministers - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) will be answering questions in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, How can consumers protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at present, a health risk is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance institution is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has connected itself immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the known concern of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Like the manufacturers, retailers must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue maximum residue of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, these are not suitable for traffic.
However, unpolluted eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the enterprises are not to blame.
Are manufacturing operations and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly liable.
Rather, they face economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of an emergency.
Is it only missing from the staff or the coherent responsibility?
It was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process.
However, truth also includes the fact that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent clarification of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors are of decisive importance in cases where crimes may be present.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is the regular alarmism of food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The means of funding have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Basically, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to quickly and completely inform the situation.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation that oversees the European match has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's financing through the powerful ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract legitimate revenue sources, which allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debts in their quest for success effectively cheating up and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - would become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP planning period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell from the presidency in 2015, its successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter it from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buyout clause in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years can be shown in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has suffered the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not accept this as a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to over payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and could simply find out such an manoeuvre for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA didn't have any preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports published show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different paths or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to be closed: the airline is relaunching the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report of the news agency sda on Friday's newspaper "Nordwestschweiz".
According to the latest planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Around 17 million small red-white chocolate boards of 14 grams distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
According to "Northern western Switzerland", the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around one billion francs in the industry - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are possible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
The largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for sda.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Two and a half years ago, Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo with Chocolat Frey with the start of the cooperation.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class nearby Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also spread over short-haul, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Olympic discus winner Robert Harting achieves World Championship final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup precursor and was only able to watch the discussion competition from the grandstand.
The Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres a long time, also qualified for the final battle with the first attempt.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year grunge era (when the proponents David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels as if time is scarce.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables that of H. Jon Benjamin was spoken).
By stealing at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless made the impossibility of regaining the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more like the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character rummaging through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The gracious Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-vicious plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is now by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black) is supported.
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun, the eternally young Mr. Rudd shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the gang, how she will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West ring campaign iconography.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, states to be a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The leading roles - a hard-built Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It is a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice jokes to watch (the police spend the time watch chess on TV, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloo Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.
Six long episodes are looming, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything the food for a reposit.
The fictitious Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Blow against drug mafia in the country
The police have hit the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Konstanz public prosecutor's office announced on Friday.
15 defendants aged 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants were issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in a similar amount of raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians.
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Konstanz public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the major operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
The investigations were maintained by Italian nationals with close connections to the Italian mafia.
An incident on the 27th May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to be held in the gang.
Wise complains about large gaps in the foreigner register
"Data of citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the immigration register in Germany has considerable shortcomings.
This leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum proceedings.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to asylum procedures and deportations "sometimes serious wrong decisions", warned in an analysis that the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" has been presented.
According to the figure, the register includes ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore administered by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality was not yet good in parts.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found "by people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and were supposed to no longer appear in the register."
"According data entry can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
In addition, EU citizens who do not have to leave the country who do not have to leave the country are covered in the statistics on people who are subject to travelling.
However, such wrong assignments led "to a distorted debate about dealing with those who want to leave the country," accordingly, the analysis says.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they have entered there.
This is evident from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is leading such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and minor children - to Italy since the 1. June 2017 through again".
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU country, which they first reach.
If a migrant passes on to another EU country, that state can send it back to the country of entry.
The office is now entitled to explain: "In the meantime, the capacity for families with minor children has increased significantly in Italy".
Italy has given guarantees for the accommodation and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) consider these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU member states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic political spokeswoman for the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Families with children are threatened by reception conditions and a threat to the best interests of the child due to the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system."
Second-rate results achieved
The blood donation service has already provided a total of 220 litres of blood for other people living in Oberreichenbach.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community pays tribute to the local council's meeting the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, and unselfish," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the district readiness of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circling head.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple dispensers and were honoured for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger were recorded half that of half, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave 500 milliliters of their lifeblood of their lifeblood, ten times.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slump" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers agreed to hold interest rates to 0.25% at the age of 6 to 2, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But it signaled that in the next few years, interest rate hikes would be necessary to curb Brexit-fuelled inflation, and she said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the mammoth economy package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion more pounds under this system - with GBP 115 billion.
Minutes following the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
With regard to interest rates, it repeated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "somewhat greater" scale than the markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "stepped" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward growth forecasts for this and next year are forecast to be 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not come to any change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate hike and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the intensification first gets worse before it improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the rise in income in the next few years, but she added that wages will "significantly" recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also being strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and economy.
Before the Bank’s last proposal on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.6% in June last month, although the bank said it was expected and it would pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said that exceeding in relation to its 2% goal was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as lenders are loudly looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals are coming out and the new mortgages are being made, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-intermail pre-intermail prevention (PrEP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent is now being supplied by a health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before being introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection-prone.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identifies appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement of 10 million dollars and NHS England.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, included and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in which more than three decades of continued progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, NAT's chief executive (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be that the study is quickly conducted throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people infected with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delay and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and how it can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This try brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is conducted throughout the country as quickly as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the prevalence of HIV in society.'
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, scaled in part of a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space for advance," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with them and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and creating a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend down.
It was not only a matter of building a simple platform, but also creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It is counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will occur and carry out a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn itself into something quite astonishing due to its good design and increased square metres of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.
Brothers fighting for a 500 million US dollar property empire
Two brothers are in conflict with one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over 500 million dollars four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. He has referred him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco family founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "main owner and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns 316 million dollars worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in the first affidavit.
Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed mediation.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions in competently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of parties using affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held from both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who were engaged in milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "high school in my last years when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to her sons amicably.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke for USD 26 million when leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, "become embittered over the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has held back very much, even though he was a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by text message to say, "I really can't say much," because the case was in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hope for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information on President Trump - including the news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a steeper course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff on his first day at work, met with executives, was a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that falls into the president's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.
"When candidate Trump was angered for unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs to be persuaded," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent.
If his employees have managed to keep anger away from him a few times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond to negative press cuttings like a volcano, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened to find out where they come from.
This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet vomayor Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staff figure Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has voiced and renounced false charges in the past.
Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and White House Secretary, Rob Porter, were "trying to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tried to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
The police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought-after sever-criminals are naturally not known, references from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding in holiday destinations, Europol said.
They have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been held, more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'Millionärs series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again at war with some committed travelers who have negotiated a ditch moved by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street from Solihull, which is called the "millionaires" series.
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed the council of Solihull, who said that "it is useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced to implement it by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived yesterday evening, probably even more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the council can't even stop that."
A resident who did not want to be named said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travellers, just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman from Solihull's Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside of Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we are presenting our case."
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be found on 1. March next year will be reopened.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on the 13th century. In April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income was lost due to the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district council, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a storey, which caused controversy discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the local council at that time.
But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties at the hotel.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a hotel of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction waste containers have been standing in front of the entrance for some time, and if you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings were partly mined, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer expresses itself.
"We want to make a jewel of it."
Swimming pool, spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.
They do not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broad, explains Scherer further.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.
He had already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, said Scherer.
The city's performances are identical to those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under one million euros, he calculates.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to shape, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Specialist Counsellor sets in Grand Jury
According to a report, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump.
The committee has started work in recent weeks, writing the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there were already first summonses by the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long blamed the Kremlin for a long time to intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally moved Trump to the centre and suggested whether the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the wake of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually switched on if they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel may also be involved by the public prosecutor's office to reload persons under oath for interrogation.
According to CNN, summons have already been issued, about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign boss Paul Manafort were also present at the talks.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the establishment showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury would be switched on at the end of order to decide on the collection of an accusation.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.
"The story of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he did not know about the appointment of a grand jury.
However, he also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House advocates any measures that "fairly" accelerated the work of the special invester.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not being investigated.
One had no reason to assume that something had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller had only been used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this throw away, accusations against Trump had been voiced that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey said in June to a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After presenting US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees.
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later stepped down President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Department of Justice at the insistence of the President.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the special investigator could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg floats in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has detached itself from the shelf ice from the nearly sevenfold size of Berlin.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and 5,800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
He does not pose a danger to people.
According to the research figures, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.
However, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelfs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus, which has now been broken off, was a part of the Larsen-C ice shelf.
Ice shelf swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and cancellation was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There are some speaks for the fact that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could decay if a piece was broke at a crux.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it results after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, according to AWI figures, with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the leading edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the broadest retreat since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow back or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say that it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attract the demolition of this gigantic iceberg from climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice rink has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.
CDU wants to house rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to leave the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the district council wav through 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have had their first working day.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very popular.
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be allocated this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions at the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as employees of general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract future-oriented applicant shortages, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for career changers and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that you used to not know.
Other cities recruit good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a veritable "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a large number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or age.
High time to act, therefore, so that no more jobs remain unfilled.
However, Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU parliamentary group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a full-fat surprise in the district day, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost capping and amazed the other parties.
People wants all possibilities to be verified that allow leaving the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district cities - should strive for a house tariff," said Peoples.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than the public service collective bargaining order.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only possible if you switch to a higher level, which is based on years of professionals.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
District adviser Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem, not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrant boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not follow new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made once we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Save', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that its crew takes inflatable boat migrants, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be reused.
At least such a meeting was allegedly held just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian coastguard, who overseen rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to hold on to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not involve "substantial changes or obstructions" of their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize winner organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
It announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries are leaving in the hope of achieving Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three guides friends were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.
This was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatine Forest and the plains in front.
In between there were ever longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, viewpoint lined up at the viewpoint, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days, many altitude differences were once again announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and retreats brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe healing in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also visited.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest at its best - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting sweatily over the stadium lawn in wind and weather?
The fact is: eSports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
This was also recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
The start was the VfL Wolfsburg in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an eSports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to get completely new young target groups excited about the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain "that several clubs are still on this move".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association is organising the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"In real football, in particular, has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online far more often in these markets than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are fought at competition level.
Like in normal sports, leagues have long been established, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And eSports is already part of the official programme at the 2022 Asian Games.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classic sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But happy also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform during online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sport were lacking.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are on the road internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for esports.
In 2016, this means that 50 million euros were spent in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is not very much against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports are "no longer away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte advisors write.
Many countries are already further ahead internationally.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are participating in US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, eSports has been introduced as a subject of teaching, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football initial league clubs, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an eSports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia only, and to glorify the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but also hosting the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," says Dutt.
"You can't say that everything only in football stays as it always was."
Gift Eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of eggs that are caused by the eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken on the shelves that have not shown any fipronil.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that urge Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who was arrested on 13. July 2014 lost his life.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the vocation.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was sentenced.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has not accepted any responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrifying circumstance that she completely regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he had not found out that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I avoid everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pains we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she would be "tracked" by the realization that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this only person I have been with every day since birth is a pain that I will always keep to me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life.
"Purt up, jump from a building, bribe yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad," and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter looked for attention from the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared legal opinion.
Among the few Carter who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to murder her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-plaintake
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to play in the Audi Cup as a captain.
FC Bayern trusts the confed cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was other in his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich immediately saw that, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer, he made the binding assigned to him on his arm.
"The coach did not say it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have run better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich.
Arturo Vidal, which wasn't eight years older, had been selected as a gaming guide in the youth players, debut enthusiasts and professionals who had just come out of the holiday, but he.
Zuckerl is one most liked to distribute to those you trust a lot to whom you want to keep you happy.
So if you have been chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old whizzed across the field as a mini-plain.
Right back, that's his position, the white bandage on her arm did the rest.
And in this starting formation Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the helm best in his hand.
He gave instructions, trying to direct the untapped troops.
He had the view for the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by taking over his missing fitness (barely folded); Renato Sanches by picking up on the performances of the Asia trip (cold only to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to stand out negatively in their first performance in the Bayern jersey.
This worked quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted confidently.
The renowned Napoli-Sturm often found it difficult, and Süle also tried successfully in the game setup a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not the way we were hoping to."
But he also showed a decent performance on the debut.
Relocation of the game, tempo change: "For this style I was also brought".
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the new arrivals, one could see afterwards.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye to his new teammates after a few crisp statements.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern you simply have to win every game".
After all, he does not have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer registered via Twitter shortly before the match and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionist is almost club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is happening with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel may also our ladies could also need well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It often turned out to be irreconcilable, the relationship between the state and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wising (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister is blaming.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Companies Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap between the Kelberg and Adenau motorway is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the ministry hopes that the ministry will be scheduled to be planning approved by 2021.
The Trier west encontracting, which is part of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The goal is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says spokesperson for ministry Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is encouraged by Wissing to promote a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been slumping for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to found their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of master education.
The homework list for the country remains long.
Facts were quick to make the planned road construction, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Of 56 new engineers who want to hire Wising at the state of their mobility, only 29 positions have so far been occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be placed at external offices.
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated the grid supply with a grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about bare Internet connections and slashes.
On the other hand, former Economics Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she cleaned up the field again after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a backlash
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of car manufacturers to install plants to neutralise exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which allow the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged by Volkswagen, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected against extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request concentrated on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer makes a disproportionate contribution to Volkswagen's profits.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
To ensure that visitors also participate, a raft drives through Munich, which has a special message, tomorrow.
If it pulls again to the Isar on Saturday, he will see a big raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to explain.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is ..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection.
Already last summer, the raft sailed over the Isar, and this year, too, there are further actions and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's tuberna and laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon artists, the tubernas of his characters are his trademark.
The Argentine still draws at 85 and is working on a film.
His message: Laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In his first years as an artist, he made himself alongside the draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when in my job lost," he once said.
After stints in Lima, New York and Paris, he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist has always been inspired by cities.
Big, rounded Mordillo figures are crowded in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, its funny figures continue to spread a lot worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-footer as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is to be released on the screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange to me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without a word.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and insects transmitting diseases, which is a major headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf ticamples, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there is a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts visitors, it is also very much in demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The fixed highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Carers, guilds, traders, vagates or a Landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard on the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and guts are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists who are suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country, more and more journalists are taking part: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under the federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is its editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence.
Its absence is deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal attorney was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, they have only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now still more traitor.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of the 15th In May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Phaulted River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, rival factions here struggling to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mousoleas for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is to blame for the fact that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
At first, in February there was a publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions during the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper stands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold 50 dollars interest.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to practice journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hit investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' from the Committee for Protecting Journalists for his courage in persecuting the Mexican drug history, wherever she leaded.
He voluntarily admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.
"You need to take on the task that you as a journalist come together - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.
"You don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways, to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of Riodoc Andres Villarreal said, that "Smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the Riodoce employees met for security training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. Days earlier, it was announced that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the state spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried an abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had regarded the Valdez column as the best informed source of the abduction.
"We would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its slender body style.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken."
The Valdez office was rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away from Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for her being reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "enchanted" of organized crime, government officials involved in them, and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under ceiling with organized crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago.
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trafficking frightened him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and were drinking beer when all of their phones suddenly began to buzz.
A number of shootouts with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howl nearby - another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who held guards to see if they were in readiness.
If they were scared at all, they did not show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you even think about closing it," said Bojorquez, "when the intern asked me to send her to the streets for coverage on the same day Javier.
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, even if a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the initial findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they even noticed that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on the 21st of the game. On March 1st, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exposing the wild animal within the earth's lump of 2,500 pounds weighing 2.100 kg.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although covered with armor and resembles a walking shell, this herbivore was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed them to be better mixed into his surroundings and avoided their enemies, experts saying what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours revealing it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter shade, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the peak of the creature was darker than its base.
Although the counter-shadeness is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the pastor - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nodosaur was subjected to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been to the Cretaceous period," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about his life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it was found in a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans were probably much wider inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as it does in the early Cretaceous period.
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you only squinte a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs stripped the earth standing on two legs.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) monster weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank in the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was born on 21. On March 1st, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips towering from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored herbivore was washed by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a winning in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it will be.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread over.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the storm: Mass carom on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on the A8 on Thursday evening: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carma.
There are numerous injured, miles of jams and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carma in the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) nearly 30 vehicles, including probably also trucks, were crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.
Initially, no information was available on the exact number of injured persons.
It was slight to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large squad of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed to Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog formed about ten kilometres long.
As an AZ report reports, there were also massive obstacles on the opposite lane - by numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade recorded the license plates of the vehicle handlebars, which are now facing severe penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing to suffer from you are sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are engrossed in your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: pufff.
Come the conductor and awakens you roughly or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of the breaks are over soon.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creative ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and thereby validate the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"Coming on the offer, we are expanding it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said one railway spokesman.
The train calls the ticket cancellation without a conductor "Comfort Check-in".
However, in order to be able to use them, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - what most passengers are already doing.
It is also necessary to buy it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking a ticket.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at ticket inspection at Y, he knows that a passenger with already validated online ticket is sitting there.
So you can keep sleeping, continuing to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train attendants relaxed without ticket control, simply check in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to personalize their travel time on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Those who often drive trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have, in any case, but in any case one of the fellow travellers do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or metropolitan area and delays in controlling one's own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet enabled.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On the 9th In August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, they sat in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it said.
Confused, because no one else had posted the information on her feed, it closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle 'TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police band and people who were screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who carried a sign with the label, "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed, in which a police officer was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I'll tell you... Animals kill all."
"This is not common," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and that we can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th cinemas onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell moved to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "over the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for what they believe in," she remembered what she said.
"We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and was not right.
I couldn't take it with me," Ferrell said later.
"What has happened today is a highlight of ... what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.
I feel I would do her a duty to keep her away from it."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was located at South Florissant Road, a town opposite the police department, which became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-advertising of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter have joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.
Slowly began to take shape a new kind of activism for Ferrell.
"My activism has moved after the 9th. August totally changed," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all came."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it otherwise."
Folayan had already collaborated with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field who is known for his activism around death twin inmates.
His commitment brought the project closer to Ferrell, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that's how I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of the black teenager Tray by Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.
"Blacks, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to carry the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held upright by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was on the front line, because there is so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which it calls her home: "A Chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went out on the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Traum" to "Size Mad": TV reader discussing Bit Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves one cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Need no human being" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates are relying on a gallery attracting more customers to the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then be bleeded.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers' market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will conclude with the start of construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farm market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very happy.
We have also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like to see that there is a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery come to the height of the rent.
However, this is probably not exactly low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What to buy palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There are already enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall retained.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also cheap.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Schade, there are almost no more specialist shops and what is left will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the Bit Gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the spectre Bit-Galerie manage to drive all businesses out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.
But there is no room for a farm market hall thanks to the insane many - I think - senseless building projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyticser nourished a 35-year prison sentence after she made diplomatic reports classified as secret on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which is located on 2. August was opened, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits created someone with these genomic data, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, if something intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits uncomfortable in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blond wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of foreigner from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the garbage to create a picture of what these people might look like.
This was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said at a press review of the new exhibition.
And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would transform Chelsea's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person.
The fact that only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release would demand after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy coincidence.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to remedy.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation whose basis has gender, race, sexuality and culture" below (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart.
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and Ace, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the artist’s highly developed scientific lexicon) to show how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also shown.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is preserved in its own space, is a page from the comic amendment mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears like King Kong with a hands-free telephone in her hand from the disciplinary leaders of the United States.
"When they calm down your speech, they won," it says.
"So never stop my mouth".
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it does, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by its own genomic simula companies, which rally like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which her genetic haplo groups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I had it on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University wanted for killing
A nationwide hunt for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who is sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were arrested for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau issued, as shown by the Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several engravings.
A communal warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body on 27 February. July was discovered.
Officers received a phone call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell Majoranleau was declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the stabs as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been on leave and was excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the UK police and are willing to help the U.S. investigation agencies in every way imaginable."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to face.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to be strongly opposed to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are stepping up," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, which said that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident was on the 27th anniversary of the season. July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give cause for concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the reported investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a bug.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Talking to the Russian sales outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody is planning to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA as part of the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be returned.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
The groups of companies announced this.
It was a mere precaution that there could still be no health impairment, the communication said.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been demonstrably tested negatively on anti-green agent containing fipronil.
Aldi wants to produce clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-commerce start-up among your employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Responses were often vague, less helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed.
She has called people outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, employees to provide anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and contact the Board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by company to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so you can down drill up why.
Companies are encouraged to see that they need to stay at the forefront of job culture so that you don't become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment, in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could hold more than 118.7 billion dollars in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Converc who helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity earlier this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has included regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found that its employees is treated poorly or behaving unethically, it may experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays' General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.
Now that Convercent is using, problems previously hidden by executives who were previously seated in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry went online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received a cash consideration of 10 million dollars in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all of the capital to 47 million dollars.
Glitzen earned 10 million dollars in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and earned its total financing to 60 million dollars.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only assignments.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are going well. Companies are going well when employees are committed and committed.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee deployment, it is no wonder that you find support.
The data on employee engagement after experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if a company's administrators do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees about your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on its way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relyed too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask yourself, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
And who you don't care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, said Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better relationship of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes towards 11 pm when a lot of UCLA football players chatted on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their Trikotober parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the next three days for the boys," said Bruins coach Jim Mora just before Monday was on Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should start at 19:15 to meet the players' schedules that have already been packed.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood.
They are meant to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the NCAA's change in rules, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this huge burden on it for three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep painting, they are great people.
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task, given the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class, which has already been puddled with footballs that vacated a protective network behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our safety," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it is a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking space 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I am not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact reviewers from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fact reviewers who may be displaying the results of the facts review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooding with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks are to be punished if they fail to eliminate hatched postings quickly like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by factual auditors of third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic-Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was shown in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is beaten so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my greeting my welcome a little"), this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape keepers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were only just beginning to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, was throwing it to the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who had what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go his walk!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse itself in English history on a broader footing, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of an uproar that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. is depicted in the century that staged his own funeral by filing a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, keep making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by married rich old women - I introduce them to me as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote heritage."
After the end of his efforts in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20. Since then, it has been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to cope with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: More than 300 years old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf
With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (round show of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too beautiful for us.
since yesterday, the makers of the action ask on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think this (of course!) do it," she write on their website unlocked yesterday.
"But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid-five-digit amount its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the official residence of the Prime Minister.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, have now also been attended by the discussions, chaired by Heads of Government.
This means that the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is moving the reins in the military.
Chief of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air force and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup experiment.
Around 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempt to overthrow as a "gift of God," because he gives him the opportunity to "completely cleanse the armed forces".
But does Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Comfort at Military Headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about the increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on the headscarf for female soldiers, wrote the paper.
In any case, the major cleaning of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 officials, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the actual masters of the country.
They painted three times, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately pushing forward the Islamisation of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who was looking for asylum after the attempted coup for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this occurs, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts about the commitment of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the cleansing.
The management structures and operational abilities are "weakened", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are spent green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate the route for Rennsteigshuttle
Again and again in recent months there has been disputes over the future of the Rennsteigshuttle - now it is to be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist railway is sailing is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term, construction work on the line is to start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue to order and refurbish the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of repairing the line estimated at around 2.5 million euros.
The country is spent 75 percent of this amount.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, will currently be finally voted, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringian Railway as the operator are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This is what the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This is intended to order the Rennsteig shuttle regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In recent months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the line will be used by many people to order it regularly again in the future.
The line is also very largely dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought that it could not become even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Professor Emeritus of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies are spending a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will become even more worrying, since many robots have the "personalities" who would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", who gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - quite like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be "in the mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape, if one takes a step towards frigid (meaning reluctance here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaked from the edges can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, where there is a president in the White House who has thus boasted of sexually attacking women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd' Report') are not the most shocking aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the winding bodies and the outgoing eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell when it comes to their "personalities," the robots do not portray real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US voting force have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.
We are all making good credit to make our filter bubbles burst.
The power of Trump to bring families together has been less noticed.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that his antics will no longer repel us one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing counterparts, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself nowadays infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - which, in fact, seem to be a very mild offense compared to Trump.
When Trump leaves, the Republican next candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park department's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growl and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the jingling music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of tall buildings are growing old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I still am not quite throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to rate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars in a department store before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where nobody is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetic, while I had tired of experiencing she had my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left the prison for a visit to the hospital for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treating cuts at his wrists, which he suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a nightly intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his penalty being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberg schools was the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen to the holidays and secondary schools.
Three of the dismissive students will go to the secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed their parents and public representatives on Tuesday evening at the Biesental town house in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for the school branch, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into the freedom.
The lively crowd led a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it incubated from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken fell apart, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young tachklingons, the cylinders wore to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmaster Angelika Sitte.
The kitten is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly rises in lesson shortages, and the parent representatives.
The chick's time is over now, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She is very relaxed after two years of lessons, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students had a song of summer time and holiday shot.
Great joy broke out with the children.
Eight first graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, told.
On the morning of the 1. In Sithonia, police arrested a group of illegal people, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control of free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place not intended for this purpose.
The controls continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust emissions behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 emission classes and some Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives views:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been the order of the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet mentioned an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it would cite everyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the conversions as a whole last?
"To say severe," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and political pressure.
"We have seen that the car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the subject of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who are not driving cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises you to wait.
According to Smetanin, foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit.
Is there a massive price decline of Euro-4 cars threatened?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there have been no depreciation for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the award winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As announced by the cultural institution on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honourers.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who has been known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would not be presented at the gala.
He told the New York Times: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - to even deprive them of the funds - and that burdens me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her view clear.
According to former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous award winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, will retire next year.
The position is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a master city architect for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible date.
For example, there should still be enough time for induction, taking into account the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the candidate must present corresponding qualifications.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they were to be able to fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the city and itself is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living in," he is sure of the building authority and its employees.
But varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: The redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz site, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still the subject.
The latter alone will beat up with around 1.5 million euros, "if we get it right," Wacker estimates.
"Everything in everything is waiting for great tasks for my successor.
The work here is fun."
Designed for a city architect, there is great room for manoeuvre.
With Haslach's own construction yard and nursery, a lot can be responded to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces are often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is listed as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye on what is happening" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city architect stresses.
In any case, the city architect bears a high degree of responsibility.
He is the builder, "in the end everything is running over my table here".
He can count on long-term employees for supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (undergroundmaking) for 15 years.
Wacker wishes to stay long for someone to know what to do so: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain with the job."
Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, if you want to buy Roland Wacker, you should be able to study completed as a graduate engineer or bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulation and construction planning law.
The municipal planning office is covered by building and civil engineering, land management, municipal properties, municipal depot with a building yard and city nursery as well as the Lower Building Law Authority, including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: southern railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators leave two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the scene, a pink roller and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a lounge stroke," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch at the APA.
The perpetrators had put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of rail replacement transport, the railway customers could also be paid to the perpetrators.
All in all, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and railway traffic on the southern railway line could be conducted without any obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday mornings, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects around 1.3 million in the USA and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrolling in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance tilts too far towards inflammation, this can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-promoted immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a type of bacteria - lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes less inflammatory intestinal environments if the same system also worked in humans.
The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice had such cells, but had no group of the same trius, which was housed separately.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbials of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop these types of immune cells, and they were given the vine and the immune cells were formed.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
With Manchester United, a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason match, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues preparation Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, suggesting Mourinho that he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him sooner than later to be ready."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signs, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to meet three of his four senior resumes.
"Three out of four to get, I would like to thank the club," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have tried to do so."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the USA, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still leader of the SPD, Social Democratic prime ministers looked to Berlin with a certain concern before the elections.
Only no troubleshooting fire from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the League - this was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz is leading the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-reigned state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds.
They were low blows.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again that red-green simply cannot govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber at the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising quit of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, its red-green coalition lost its unity to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens-based managing director Michael Kellner has called on the renegade Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate.
The conversion to the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.
Elke Twesten has to return her mandate immediately," said the Federal Managing Director and Campaign Manager of the Green Party to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"That's all may not be true," sighs as the new bad news of the party headquarters reached the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there to become the CDU without a majority of the government of his own government after the conversion of the Green MPs Elke Twesten.
It is the temporary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations.
And nobody knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at that time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
This became then - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel led the SPD into frenzy, the Düsseldorf-Pleite smoothly banged the party.
The comrades painfully rapped themselves up again in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just had encouraged new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of the country, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie, while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for its political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time.
Miese poll figures were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because has tried to set accents in the covenant in the past few weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, comrades in the vicinity of Martin Schulz did not remain hidden.
They allowed him to be granted because they promised to stabilize the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because is basically no fault in the internal party dispute of the Lower Saxon Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and above all to the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and harmful to democracy how Ms Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party leftists in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but on the list of the Dutch Greens, the Lower Saxony member continued.
The logical consequence would be to give back its mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, deplores an "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD into the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be cleared up.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funds for local centre III
If you want to renovate your house old, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the I renovation area from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately also important to promote internal development and not only open up new construction areas.
On the 4th In April, the Karlsruhe Regional Council has received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounted to EUR 833 333, of which 500,000 euros would come from the countryside, the remainder of the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a redevelopment area created?
According to Schindler, one will examine where the "real old" houses are.
But it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to clean up.
If necessary, the area boundaries could then also shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objects-related, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then be determined as a statute.
The approval period for the funding has been running since the 1st of the grants. January 2017 until 30. April 2026.
By September this year, however, the inventory would be carried out first, in which those involved in the redevelopment area will receive a questionnaire to complete.
If possible, the resolution of the statutes is to be provided in November or December, so that the renovations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the said advance investigations.
It is about assessing the urban maladministration and deciding when to redevelop and to what extent.
A remediation report will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen himself again and get an idea of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the involved involved.
There will therefore be questionnaires, which will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Land Sheet", which is about the structural condition and the intentions to renovate.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet", information on the size, division and residents of a living space can be provided.
The blue "operating sheet" can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
Furthermore, new building measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of the funding based on the "sighthound principle" works - whoever comes first serves first.
You cannot "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the present a refurbishment "shameful".
British inventor sits down for himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has come together with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, merges to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog-implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional cost of 300 dollars per castle.
The married father of one has now incorporated both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to 24,000 US dollars, according to the military's information provided to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on 17th. July in the White House with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter on the 17th July around 7am at the South Lawn for the event arrived at 3pm, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of the service.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground on the plane during the time.
The records provided by TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Kling as if you were locked," replied the deputy commander.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to contain government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane held taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled by the show "Made In America" - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Deputy Press Secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 charges often carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to deduct the US president in the White House with precise centimetre sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was worth the training need for the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly tariffs of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
Records from the unit registered the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"The costs for taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates are highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky representatives and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
Leaders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will be competing at the third standings Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will be competing in Kiel at the Tablethickth Suchsdorfer SV tomorrow in 11 a.m.
Despite five games, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has had a sense of reality.
Team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
I find the team very good on the back positions."
The class and stability of the Suchsdorfer SV primarily ensure imports from the far north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to appearances in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's going hard for us as always.
You also need a good dose of luck."
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
Maxime Janvier could make his debut for Blue and White.
If the Frenchman who is currently still active at the Challenger tournament in Biella, there will be his first appearance at the tournament Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), which plays at the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, for his first appearance this season.
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who has so far had been undefeated with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel am Ball yesterday.
However, he was supposed to be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also be put on the team again.
If it is enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one junior world ranking in January 2016, it is not enough, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law to tighten up Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to pass the law," Congress had packed a few "constitutionally unlawful regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies to help Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
Since then, investors in domestic OMV have been correspondingly worried, who together with other European companies co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement by the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which of the company could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put in the core of Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, the Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, the Netflix show is far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pea, the type who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be on 1st. September begin.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city is reorganising the daycare center itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the municipal daycare centres.
To the 1st In September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal daycare facilities (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Youth Welfare department, this is good news: "We were all very happy."
Cooking is still out of the house: A caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 children receive a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the last kitta year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, it is not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week, eat at lunch at daycare," explains Pomerania.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 part-time forces have from the 1. September Kitchen Service: They warm the delivered dishes, add salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, release the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a daycare centre," says Pomerania.
The size - there are two-group and seven-group facilities - decides on the hourly range.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pomerania satisfied.
"They are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for daycare management."
This is also what it is all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchenpower to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a familiar power in the kindergarten, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day-care rooms - up to now also a task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of the kitchen services, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between self-direction and external allocation for the city, it is said from the press office.
And this even though 46 part-time forces are being reset.
"But these hours are not so much important to around 750 people in the educational sector," says Sonja Pomerania.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run for trials in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will be held on 5 February. April held.
The Taliban have published threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be given the power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered.

Men trying to rob 13 year old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who was staying with friends on Kolpingstraße at around 14:55 because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused to ask and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
The duo fled without prey.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is underway.
GMB concern to invest in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to ensure the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company had silenced about the future of investment at Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would "alive" experienced as their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "think that financing for the modernisation of production lines would not be pushed forward."
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affected by our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses heavily on the local community and the greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, during which some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The site of La Liga likes its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in her persecution of Neymar after she has sold an offer of 189 million dollars to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record lapse?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
Upon completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned against this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, then it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian International to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of her price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overthrew a scooter parked in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused property damage of more than 200 euros in the fairing of the vehicle.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, ask for notes.
The police are looking for witnesses to a accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to meet him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to avoid it and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum travelled towards Leese with his VW at around 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area of the local bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his lane, so that he had to switch to the right.
The Touran rider touched the guardrail.
Property loss was caused by the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without caricuring the traffic accident.
According to the accident, it may well be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident.
The police now ask witnesses to the incident and the drivers of the polluter vehicle, under tel. 05761 / 92060 to contact the Commissariat in Stolzenau.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to hold discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are church," declared after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as the cathedral band Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would be very much to serve the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of the events.
The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that when reporting on violence in the cathedral beds, "two kinds of measures" were measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubts that these were "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioeth ethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal," writes Scaraffia.
In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said: "You like to go to the church and that is a found eat."
She also pointed out that in her youth "beats were a normal educational mean," "to cope with cheeky children like me, one were able to cope."
It would find it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often also emerged.
Completely unjustly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memory "My brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he says, assessing the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Bishopric of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral patches were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility", 67 Domspatzen sexually abused "with high plausibility".
The final report states Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that in many cases of cathedral band master R. were used forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially with a high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.
Nevertheless, unlike numerous other accused, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, even combine positive memories with him despite violence."
In an interview, Hesemann explains why he thinks the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of violence against protection staff at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a cathedral bite did not achieve a top performance musically.
How do you consider this final report as its biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from start to finish, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even occurs in it.
He is dedicated to just eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
One can at best be accused of having experienced it too late or not having taken the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzen grammar school, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all interviewees as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also expresses a very excellent testimony, describing him as a "warm-hearted", "popular", "sancitation", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has sometimes led to outbursts of rage.
He himself gave years old that he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also slaps distributed and all too cheeky boys were spread by the hair or ears, he himself gave up years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In his salvation of honour, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and teachers.
Do you know such punishment methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state secondary school.
However, compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivialities.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media were rushing at him.
On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still working actively.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a lot was reported on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or personality with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Very clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral bandmaster.
Not even the parents were privy to.
"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," one of them said on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators, to a certain extent, professionally.
How do Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role in cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it is ... also really absurd to assume that it is ... Boys have opened up more urgently or clearly or even more so than towards their parents, boarding school leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That one talks to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
The report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that the students and/or their environment entrusted himself to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquired from every community.
So he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or reported it.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "waltexes" to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral bandmaster Georg Ratzinger is accused of "Trails" in the report.
Does he have to live with this reproach?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem that everything in the reporting has been mixed and mixed into a huge way of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what is again an abuse of the report.
There is cleanly separated: between the preschool and the secondary school of the cathedral platforms, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, and, say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating education, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly from them, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But cathedral band master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
They were only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What was different at the Domspatzen grammar school?
Michael Hesemann: Discipline already existed, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him in numerous cases, despite violence".
At the very matter, there is still the accusation that they have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported on the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness), and only then again around 1993.
Do Georg Ratzinger consistently lock the ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzen grammar school, which the report even reproduces.
In it he points out that "the caning continues to be practised in preschool."
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when caning punishments were long banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been crossed.
But you can't say that he's always looking away.
That is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that the canal in schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply to today's educational standards to the time.
How do you see this?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trap rope of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was always abominable and not for what was caused in preschool to renounced in the preschool of indulgences and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual time.
This is all quite terrible and I am glad that it is finally being processed.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slaps in the ear and ear, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger show in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating also come up to speak out?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he was leading a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for an unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to shape an institution of world-class rank from the previously better nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and sweets alone, one does not make any great singers out of unruly boys and stand before every success, right in whatever area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As if you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and have repeatedly experienced people as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-good people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could even suffer a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his retirement, keeping regular contact with him, visiting him, reading to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who still do not forgive him that he was once strict to them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Today, most of the cathedral pastages are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certain, that may be - but was also a lovely respect person to whom they still look up today and who they actually worship.
And please, once again very clearly, everything you accuse him of being educated are methods of education that were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to make it a media scapegoat.
There is the evil intention behind it all too obvious.
The report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would require a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and would finally let the Regensburger Domspatzen know the Regensburg Domspatzen outside Bavaria and perhaps even more of Germany.
