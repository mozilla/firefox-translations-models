Schools are being encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
English literature courses will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
&quot;Unseen texts&quot; are also included in the exam to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take a standalone GCSE for Language, although there are strong incentives to choose English Literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will tomorrow publish the new syllabuses for English and Maths - the first subjects to be radically overhauled.
Other core courses will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exams regulator, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech over the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was &quot;a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence&quot;, stressing that GCSEs would become &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous&quot;.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths – 116 hours a year, or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time to maths in the curriculum, coalition sources say the comprehensive maths test - combined with a greater weighting of the subject in rankings - is likely to encourage schools to allocate more hours.
More emphasis is placed on &quot;real life problems&quot; in the curriculum, including financial mathematics.
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act sparked national outrage.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
Doctors fought for the victim&#39;s survival for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the youngsters was so horrific that the orderlies and nurses needed psychological support.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to hitting and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl&#39;s death.
The police initially assumed that there were several perpetrators, but released two suspects because there was insufficient evidence against them.
The public prosecutor&#39;s office also emphasized during the proceedings that they were convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are around 64,000 reports of sexual violence every year.
That is almost ten times as many as in Germany, which with 82 million people has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women&#39;s associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable oddball because he has decided to take part in a race in America on his 1920 motorcycle.
Despite a heart defect, Burt cannot be dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he sails to Los Angeles.
After the film there will be coffee, tea and cake.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in suspense.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued trading unhindered.
The latest incident continues a series of minor and major glitches at the stock exchange operator.
The Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour on Tuesday due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year there were two breakdowns in just one week.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent masses of erroneous buy orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through the orders and cancel them.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer glitch on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Facebook&#39;s IPO last year also caused a stir.
The SEC later found that the Nasdaq systems were unable to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, and fined the company a record $10 million.
Secret service investigator Edward Snowden is in principle ready for talks with German authorities.
First, however, he wants his situation clarified.
The former NSA employee wanted by the USA made this clear in an unaddressed letter that the Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter has the following wording:
To those in charge
I have been asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I am a former contract and direct employment technical expert with the United States National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government that have prompted me to act out of a moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I have faced serious and ongoing incitement that has forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as high officials -- including the United States -- have viewed the revelations about a system of overarching, unaccountable surveillance as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations prompted many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at previously covert abuses of public trust.
The benefit to society from the knowledge gained is becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted were visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my administration continues to treat dissent as breach of faith and seeks to criminalize and criminalize political expression.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will change this harmful stance.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible investigation of the facts related to the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in an appropriate and lawful manner participate.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Driver fined £1,000 for speeding at 130mph with hot drink between legs
A motorist has been fined £1,000 for driving at up to 210km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree on May 27th.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In Colchester Magistrates&#39; Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 in costs and a £100 victim&#39;s surcharge.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machetes
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper &quot;El País&quot; reported on Thursday.
Then they played football in front of their apartments in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger boy, whom they took away, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the course of events to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
One of the reasons given by the older man was a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily admitted to a juvenile psychiatric institution.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
A US government official who wished to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air force base in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
The target was &quot;missiles and related equipment,&quot; which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled in the night from Wednesday to Thursday and blamed the Israelis for it.
Israeli TV Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Neva anti-missile missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 says have a range of 35 kilometers and warheads up to 70 kilograms can transport.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack but was not certain.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: &quot;We do not comment on these reports.&quot;
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously tried, sometimes successfully, to supply Hezbollah with surface-to-air missiles.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a &quot;red line&quot; that would be followed by a military response.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
dr Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, just one for every 5,000 people
Vote here or on your mobile device
dr Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father repeatedly pass out and travel to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he just broke his arm, but then inflammation developed and spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
&quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; said Georges Bwelle.
We would have gotten him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals for the treatment they had to offer.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy,&quot; Bwelle comments.
You can leave home at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be first and not be first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has changed little since Bwelle&#39;s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
This compares to one doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country&#39;s health expenditure is private.
&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
dr Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and, with the medical equipment tied to the roof, drive across unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Things don&#39;t always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: a feast, song and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real cause for celebration, and Bwelle - with his big smile and boundless energy - is happy to join in the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
&quot;We treat 500 people per trip,&quot; says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village - and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a range of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - a document required for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is powered by the group&#39;s generator, so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It&#39;s a busy schedule, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
&quot;They drum all night so we can stay up and get on with our work,&quot; says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group -- a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students -- have performed 700 free surgeries in the last year and know their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free hernia surgery he received now allows him to return to work.
&quot;It changes the future of my family,&quot; the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
&quot;I really don&#39;t know when he sleeps,&quot; says Katie O&#39;Malley, a sophomore in medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Bwelle&#39;s group.
He&#39;s always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to go on these campaigns.
For US and European medical and nursing students like O&#39;Malley who support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
&quot;We can be present at surgeries where we help to swab blood or provide instruments for Dr. hold the Bwave,&quot; explains O&#39;Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of accommodation, transport and guidance.
&quot;He&#39;s a hero without a doubt,&quot; says O&#39;Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
The almost constant work is not a burden for Bwelle.
Helping others lead happier lives, fulfilling a promise he made to his father, brings him great joy.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy doing this work,&quot; says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I&#39;m doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer vote in the papal election - that falls to a group of 120 &quot;eligible cardinals&quot;.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the consistory.
&quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be scheduled,&quot; Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote will likely have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals eligible to vote back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he likes.
Next year&#39;s consistory is significant because it is the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
&quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,&quot; he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, yet they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of Francis&#39;s Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world charged with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
&quot;Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said.
He said it was &quot;very possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven&#39;t been in this position before - it&#39;s all brand new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from big places would be appointed cardinals, but Francis is &quot;full of surprises - so we don&#39;t know who he is appointing&quot;.
Worker fell from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a defective outside sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder on Thursday and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital by the &quot;Christophorus 6&quot; rescue helicopter.
Is Europe&#39;s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing business around the table and defining what those who make Britain prosperous and jobs want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think of the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, roughly representing UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while those in the EU are stagnating.
They want governments to favor new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than dwell on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU&#39;s obscure institutions.
When asked for their views on specific regulatory issues - from antitrust to product legislation - the majority of business leaders believe control of these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market as businesses said the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe&#39;s trade zone - even 40 per cent of big companies agreed with those traditionally most pro-European.
Finally, and perhaps this says most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority would like the UK to steer a course towards deal change and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, shared by companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a &quot;change that makes sense&quot; that will put the reins of business back in the UK.
A lot is at stake - changing the deal and giving Britain better terms would see 16 per cent change their minds in favor of staying in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British business is behind his plan to renegotiate Britain&#39;s terms of EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the Eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, the results of our survey show, which means an increased focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental shift in Brussels&#39; approach to regulation.
Square concert in high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifted the baton at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still showed 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairwoman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to successfully overcome the first musician&#39;s hiccup.
Learning instead of being unemployed: pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today in the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already unskilled in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to become specialists for hotels and restaurants.
&quot;What&#39;s new is that the six-month courses end with degrees,&quot; said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants would not become unemployed, the companies would get trained specialists, which are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-West Pomerania are also involved in the project.
Dog lovers successful

Susi Höpp and her Woody in Class 1 faced the critical gaze of the judge.
GM is recalling new US pickup trucks for seatback repairs
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix an issue with the manual seatback, the US vehicle safety regulator said on Friday.
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for reclining the front seat back.
Because of this, they do not meet federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints.
&quot;If the vehicle is rear-ended, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, increasing the risk of injury,&quot; read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
Deliveries of the GM trucks began in June and represent the leading US automaker&#39;s most important model launch since its bankruptcy-related restructuring in 2009.
GM notified vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which hurt auto sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Mother buried in the forest and collected pension
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg came up with a plan.
He buried the dead woman in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
According to police investigations, a 67-year-old from Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest in order to be able to continue to collect his pension and care allowance.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he pocketed the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it was noticed that the mother, who was in need of care, no longer needed any medication.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officers found this strange, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in the same apartment for more than 15 years and that he had recently taken care of them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy found no evidence of a felony, police said.

Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling brake vans with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from September 6th to 8th.
The Highlander Games start at 1.30 p.m. on Saturday, September 7th.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have a Swabian touch at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines of throwing logs, throwing horseshoes and carrying buckets of water.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t depend on the distance,&quot; explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown off vertically, should roll over once and then come to a straight stop.
This is rated with the most points.
When it comes to horseshoe throwing, accuracy is key.
A stake is thrown from eight meters away.
The participants have to prove their dexterity and strength by carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
Two from each &quot;clan&quot; or team can then take part in the individual competition.
Prizes will be awarded to the winners of the team and individual competitions.
Training can begin at 10 a.m.
Appropriate clothing is desirable, for example the competitors can compete in a kilt.
But Swabian costumes are also allowed.
The jury awards a few bonus points for the &quot;outfit&quot;.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evenings, fans of brass band music will get their money&#39;s worth.
At 7 p.m., the Bira-Bohemian brass band from Schömberg creates the great evening of entertainment.
The band plays lively polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen, known as the singing innkeeper and black sausage baron, will be there.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fools&#39; guild.
On Sunday, the Leinstetten music club will be entertaining for a morning pint, from 2 p.m. the Böffingen farmers&#39; band will be guests, and the &quot;oldies&quot; will then round off the festival.
The stubble acker party with DJ Ralf starts on Friday.
Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the classic car and tractor meeting, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other Sunday attractions include the corn maze, craft market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein multi-purpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends &quot;Zündkäpsele&quot;.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
&quot;We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: What is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?&quot; read the newspaper, which believes the bill is unconstitutional.
&quot;The law is draconian and very punitive and we oppose it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, chief executive officer of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya&#39;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it is an extension of the government&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya&#39;s position in the global economy.
&quot;I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,&quot; he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government&#39;s new law is &quot;effectively putting a stranglehold on the media&quot;. In contrast, The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been &quot;taken a serious blow&quot;, calling the bill &quot;draconian&quot;.
The law&#39;s passage is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September.
The Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities by releasing security camera footage of officers dispatched to the scene allegedly robbing the luxury mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media figure for questioning, although the subpoena was withdrawn after media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to 1 million, with the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being barred from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, &quot;a single fine can bankrupt most radio stations.&quot;
The newspaper also believes these measures could have a devastating impact on what it describes as Kenya&#39;s &quot;vibrant blogosphere.&quot;
By silencing the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
&quot;No one will ever know,&quot; wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
&quot;If left to their own devices, politicians will bankrupt the country and take us back to the hunter-gatherer days,&quot; he commented.
Kenyan lawmakers have drawn public anger in the past.
In May they voted to reverse cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reinstated their hefty salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free a month - among the highest in the world.
2014 will be a year of celebrations in Geising
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is approaching.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
A document was made in churches in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will celebrate the 1250th anniversary during a festival weekend from July 18th to 20th.
celebrate return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festival weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener church festival.
Town music director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the town on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On June 21 together with the midsummer celebration of the Black Forest Association, on July 12 in the arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of the town music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend in September, on September 27th and 28th.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle is published.
&quot;It should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today&#39;s Geisingen, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,&quot; says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today&#39;s Geisingen is also celebrating its birthday in 2014. In 1974, today&#39;s spatial structure was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle should then be presented on November 21st or 22nd in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki fools&#39; guild begins on February 8th with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Gutmadingen harmony turns 90 and has the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10th, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from July 4th to 7th.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation held by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in Kirchen (Hausen), which was then the place of justice.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason enough to celebrate this 1250th anniversary in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform was 40 years ago.
Also this year, on the name day of Saint Hubertus, a Hubertus mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstrasse.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn group of the Jagdreiter Westfalen, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays on par force horns (natural horns tuned to E flat) to old, originally French melodies.
The horns wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and packs of dogs on drag hunts musically.
The solemn mass will take place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 am.
Supreme Court upholds Obama&#39;s health care law
It&#39;s a major victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five votes to four, the judges ruled that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — which requires US citizens to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty through 2014 — is constitutional under the state&#39;s taxing authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against.
The court also affirmed the remainder of the 2,700-page statute and held that the health care code&#39;s requirement that states either expand Medicaid eligibility requirements or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally restrictive.
Legal action against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was firmly opposed by all of the leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
Of the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the &quot;Helping Hands&quot; association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the operations were shown on a large screen so that the guests at the anniversary event could get an idea of the actions mentioned.
The club&#39;s desert vehicle was also on display.
It is a former Federal Border Patrol vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former mayor of Nagold, had made the suggestion to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Henne, to work for the association in an advisory capacity.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry from Baiersbronn built the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
As a doctor, you learn a lot in Africa, says Henne, for example slowing down to prevent burnout.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to travel as much as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to sit in on different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by talking about Mercedes vehicles from Mauritania that had been converted into mobile goat stalls and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their trip to Mauritania.
He cited his work in auditing as a young MP as his personal motivation.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans get a budget overseen by the people.
Fuchtel also emphasized that global economy also requires global philanthropy.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than many people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary between the old schoolyard and Kirchstraße, which is about to be renovated, is to be included in the city of Bräunlingen&#39;s renovation cost plan.
In the days before Kilbig, a small angle wall was installed during the first renovation work on the front schoolyard to stabilize and relieve the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok from Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure envisages involving the State Monuments Office in the planning and creating a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation should be made by experts, which should then be put on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine how to proceed.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, hundred-year-old wall separating the old schoolyard from Kirchstraße is in need of renovation, mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, and has a forward arch.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not in danger of collapsing.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school yard used by pupils, which is the result of the current fortification work.
The renovation of the schoolyard was originally planned for 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses caused it to be postponed.
The State Monuments Office will have an important say in the renovation of the historic school wall, which has even been used for filming.
If specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the preservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlingen elementary school, who are now being taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management announced via the short message service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama will be kept informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident took place in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure lounges, multiple media outlets reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had panicked and sought shelter.
Travelers screamed and children cried.
Panic broke out among those waiting, and many hid behind chairs out of fear.
A traveler told the Los Angeles Times that he heard two shots.
An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was &quot;like in a movie&quot;.
Then he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
Airport building evacuated
TV pictures showed how numerous ambulances and police cars drove up to a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special task force and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, resulting in long tailbacks, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several planes could also be observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is primarily served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village car park in Gutach went into operation - within sight of the older traffic lights in the town hall.
Two systems so close together: on purpose or silly prank?
Gutach&#39;s mayor gave a clear answer to this question yesterday.
&quot;The traffic lights in the town hall were installed back then because they make it easier to get to school,&quot; Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light keeps cyclists, bus passengers and Bergle residents safe.
The system, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, and the flow of traffic from the ›Grub‹ residential area.
&quot;With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light was needed for their safety,&quot; says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg district office.
&quot;According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles drive through the community of Gutach on the B 33 every day, around ten percent of which are heavy goods traffic,&quot; emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: &quot;Safety simply comes first here,&quot; says Arnold.
A total of four traffic inspections were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but rejected again because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when selecting the location for the traffic light masts: &quot;Using a transporter specially loaded for us with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles could drive out of Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without knocking over the traffic light mast&quot;.
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is the &quot;most modern thing currently on the market,&quot; explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be clearly seen by drivers, for example even when the sun is low in the sky.
And it&#39;s also economical: the older lighting systems consume around 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lights in each direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, pedestrians will see green immediately, if not, it takes around 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian.
&quot;Should a group or people with walking difficulties cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can cross the road safely,&quot; explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic light for pedestrians turned green, a luxury vehicle rushed through - with a bright red light.
Patience pays off
Six men&#39;s teams fought for the winning title in the club tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf received fantastic weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The focus of the tournament was on having fun playing tennis.
There were five games per team, with everyone playing against everyone else.
The game was played in doubles mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter is in charge of the tournament
The tournament management was in the experienced hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were level on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams from SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to present the challenge cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the home straight.
Second place went to the doubles Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze podium went to Rainer and Bernd Maier from the Asphaltriecher team.
The successful conclusion of the tournament took place with late afternoon sun and coffee and cake.
Bird rescued from North Sea oil rig by air rescue service released again
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service and found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild.
The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was cared for by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their sanctuary in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, director of the centre, said: &quot;This water rail was likely a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was delayed by the strong winds over the North Sea.&quot;
Apparently, the exhausted bird took refuge on the oil rig.
He added, &quot;He couldn&#39;t fly any further, so we were contacted for help.&quot;
When released, the water rail was fit and healthy again.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation and electric traction, has now been discovered.
US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which zigzags the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless nondescript warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected, authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized, according to court records.
Three men who authorities said were working as drivers were charged with possession and attempted sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison terms of between ten years and life if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after October&#39;s marijuana harvest in central Mexico, posing a challenge for drug cartels on how to get their product to users quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a 2,100-foot passage of rails that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subject to &quot;authenticity tests.&quot;
The government is considering an &quot;authenticity test&quot; for foreign workers on 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If the test were introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to come to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned government comments on foreign workers, saying they could be considered offensive by Australia&#39;s neighbours.
&quot;Loud statements like &#39;foreigners should queue&#39; and &#39;Australians hire first&#39; are a very uncomfortable throwback to a time when unions were demanding a protected labor market,&quot; she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant white workers should be protected — and if some in the region hear echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once envisaged by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to hold talks on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes while the others are still under consideration.
If the &quot;authenticity criterion&quot; is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked as to whether &quot;the application is authentic in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting enterprise .&quot;
Firms could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after a history of companies that initially wanted to support a small number of workers eventually hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died, believed to be of a heart attack, after arriving in Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The distraught nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father&#39;s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian place lights up with giant mirrors
The inhabitants of a small Norwegian town have brought light into their gloomy valley with huge mirrors.
Due to the low level of sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
&quot;Finally!&quot; enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers pulled out sun loungers, others put on sunglasses to be on the safe side.
Until now, sun-seekers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen proposed using mirrors to direct the rays down into the valley.
This basic idea had existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the project, which cost 5 million crowns (around 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been bringing winter sunshine to the Italian alpine town of Viganella for a number of years.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
For this purpose, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery of MPs and the federal police.
The migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its deliberations in the morning.
Among other things, it should be about the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the topic of traffic, which is not on the agenda for this Friday, the SPD underscored its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a &quot;flat rate for frequent driving and therefore ecologically counterproductive,&quot; explained the SPD negotiator for traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.
There was a threat of alternative traffic on country roads, which are already accident black spots.
In Pronold&#39;s view, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step.
&quot;There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be canceled at a later date,&quot; he said.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the stockpile.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to importing coal, Rhenus Midgard focuses on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
The black coal shimmers in the storage area in front of the dyke.
Two huge blue dumpers and reclaimers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the handling equipment moves, a shrill warning noise sounds across the site.
&quot;The signals serve to ensure safety and are required by law,&quot; says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, when the wind is unfavorable, this can be heard from afar - and so there have already been some complaints from people in the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, technical measures are now being taken to keep the warning signals quieter.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbors in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot planned for the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the big players in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the sunbath in front of the terminal, which is 18.5 meters deep, cape-size bulk carriers have long been able to be handled here.
&quot;This year we want to break the 3 million ton mark in handling,&quot; says Schrell.
In addition to the on-site Eon power station, the imported coal goes to inland power stations.
If the GDF-Suez power plant were also connected to the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could handle up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot;The building is in good hands,&quot; says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality sold the former kindergarten on Gartenstrasse to a private individual.
The municipal council approved the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed hands at a &quot;reasonable&quot; price.
&quot;The community is satisfied,&quot; emphasizes Maier.
The budget was €100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is fine that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
&quot;This effort is gone now,&quot; says Maier happily.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I got to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I&#39;ve become more of a Halloween muffle.
I have not agreed to give out candy from my home for the last two years and I probably won&#39;t do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I&#39;m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million, to be precise — are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is trending values.
The costumes will account for about $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to NRF.
This year, slinky inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer have to dress up in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men go, I&#39;m expecting plenty of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I&#39;m betting the daft punk spacemen will be making the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Witches.
I suppose there&#39;s nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed up our dogs and to my surprise we were not alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to NRF.
That&#39;s a lot of &quot;hot dogs&quot;.
When it comes to sweets, we&#39;re not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That&#39;s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, sweets and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people trick-or-treating, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will be buying and, let&#39;s face it, eating over 100 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween.
The only thing we don&#39;t want to consume is the sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That&#39;s about nine billion kernels of corn.
It&#39;s a mystery I haven&#39;t been able to solve yet.
Nothing says Halloween like haunted houses.
They have great names like &quot;Terror Behind the Walls&quot; (which is in a real prison, by the way), &quot;Howl-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;The House of Shock&quot;.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that gross $500 million, according to America Haunts, and that includes the gorgeous photos of you peeing your pants in the act and then posting your friends on Facebook where you can&#39;t get rid of it, and then the guy you fancy leaves you with a comment like &quot;nice facial expression&quot;.
But let&#39;s finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o&#39;-lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree—something we&#39;ve done since we were little.
Thankfully, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin&quot; trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin, not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The jack-o&#39;-lantern slowly rotting in the front yard is thought to have originated in Illinois, where 500 million pounds of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score big, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 2,000-pound pumpkin.
Pimp goes to jail
The Constance Regional Court has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
According to this, in five cases he met women through internet or telephone contacts, whom he sent out on the streets against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He withheld the earnings of the women, some of whom had worked for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he cut off women&#39;s contact with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them monitored in part in order to control their income.
The defendant initially claimed in court that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated that he had serious doubts about the mental impairment and thus the limited criminal responsibility, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As a police officer reported, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after an initial report through telephone surveillance measures.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by a high level of aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, on whom one of the women had discovered bruises all over her body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is about &quot;a completely broken personality&quot; who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this profession.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
&quot;He has broken away from these circles and wants to lead a completely normal life after his imprisonment,&quot; he said.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
An investigation has been launched by the State Corruption Service into former New South Wales Labor Minister Joe Tripodi.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime leasing rules at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who held hidden interests in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday widened its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various Ministers of State to agree to leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids ran two restaurants and a cafe, without a tender after they expired in August 2005 to be extended.
An investigation is now underway into allegations that Tripodi knew of Obeid&#39;s covert interest in the properties, after Tripodi&#39;s former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified on Thursday.
In years of talks beginning in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which brought in $2.5 million a year for the Obeids, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally advocated public tenders.
But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who Tripodi confirmed had been pushing for an overhaul of the government&#39;s tenancy rules.
A telephone transcript provided to ICAC showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ports Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
&quot;Was the subject discussed in those phone calls the drafting of the commercial lease arrangements?&quot; asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
&quot;No,&quot; replied Tripodi.
I don&#39;t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn&#39;t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
NSA revelations fuel corporate paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&#39;s financial capital.
On orders from the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), Germany&#39;s domestic intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US should not use foreign espionage avenues “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies to increase their international competitiveness or profits could.&quot;
But ever since whistleblower-turned-employee Edward Snowden began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate bosses have been unsure whether to take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and obtained data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have sent corporate paranoia over government surveillance to a new high.
The final straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone had been bugged, possibly for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate executives are certainly potential targets as well.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
&quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consultancy firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was no evidence that the US had passed trade secrets from foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
It was suggested in the Bundestag that we should set up a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
&quot;It doesn&#39;t work that way,&quot; says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn&#39;t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Still, the reach and sophistication of US espionage agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations has shocked firms that previously saw the greatest espionage risk in China.
A major shift is taking place in cloud computing as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, about 10 percent of non-US members dropped plans to use a US provider after the revelations about US data mining activities using Prism.
Jim Snabe, executive vice president of SAP, says, &quot;We&#39;re seeing a new question from customers that wasn&#39;t there a year ago - it&#39;s where is my data stored and can you guarantee it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?&quot;
Many German business leaders believe the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore protect them at all costs.
It is no surprise that industrial espionage is taking place.
It has always been like this.
&quot;It was an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion,&quot; says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, as do we, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate leadership usually doesn&#39;t brag about the countermeasures they&#39;ve taken because it gives attackers an advantage.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick with you to a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at automaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to collect cell phones before board meetings so they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use basic prepaid cell phones when traveling abroad because smartphones can potentially be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche.
&quot;Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, human resources and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access,&quot; warns the BVT in a report.
The USA warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia and Israel as the second countries after China to use hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to industrial espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot;
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France&#39;s internal intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted as saying in an interview this month: &quot;The intelligence agencies know very well that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.&quot;
When the horse show experts flocked to Cardiff to crown the Horse of the Year, they knew the competition was going to be tough.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The pre-kindergarten tot, who only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted easily through the three rounds to take first prize - beating 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both of the same height, were praised for their demeanor, demeanor and style at the annual competition, held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff.
Appearing in competition against both men and women in stylish bowler hats, he had his flat cap on at a cheeky angle and was leading two-year-old Toffee around the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to handle the pony, which was well beyond his years.
And Toffee received top marks for his demeanor and personality.
Fenton received Toffee as a present for his third birthday last March and has practiced with the Shetland Pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, &quot;Fenton and Toffee make a great team.&quot;
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the field with the gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, &quot;The whole audience was electrified and everyone was cheering and clapping for him.&quot;
He walked the entire length of the arena on clay and despite looking so tiny he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens that he takes care of.
The way he started it won&#39;t be long before he&#39;s in the Horse of the Year Show - and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, &quot;Fenton is only three but he knows how to handle his pony.&quot;
Together they are a great team.
The judges rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they performed and presented in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and handler - and that&#39;s where Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I&#39;m sure Fenton&#39;s cute attire played her part, it really suited the occasion perfectly.
Nursing day at the small Englishman&#39;s hut
A group of committed participants met at the small Englishman&#39;s hut in Ibach for what is now the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project in the upper Hotzenwald.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley in the area of the hut should be cut out that day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers describe this area as the highlight of the gorge trail, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the care day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between people and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological aspect can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Regional Council explained this ecological aspect after the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had assumed the patronage and wished the campaign every success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the foresight coincides with the goal of preserving the old Allmendweidfeld field, which has meanwhile become very overgrown, with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot cross barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free links for conservation.
Tribukait said she didn&#39;t want to miss the opportunity to take a stand for the planned biosphere reserve.
The current measure not only fits seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere reserve also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the forest tractor was available if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was a clear view at the viewpoint.
Experienced an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the senior citizens of Dieting to coffee, cake and then a snack.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were entertained in the service area.
This afternoon now takes place in the St. Josef nursing home.
The residents enjoyed the delicious cakes and tarts.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
Königsfeld: Small team is doing well
The volunteer fire brigade mastered its autumn main test with flying colors despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer chose the Feder property on Burgberger Strasse for his exercise assignment.
A short circuit is said to have occurred there when sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two firefighters wearing respiratory protection got ready to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was found and escorted outside.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there were also narrow stairs to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
A lot of wood and bales of straw were stored in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was via an above ground hydrant about 100 meters away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what can be done with little staff available.
In an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daily task force.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations process
A week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany, Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process.
&quot;After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years,&quot; Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif wrote on his Facebook page.
There is still a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution.
A$325 million bailout for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government is insisting on the tough conditions attached to the A$325 million bailout of Tasmania&#39;s healthcare system to ensure the state government cannot squander the money.
German Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced the Commonwealth will take &quot;immediate action&quot; to avert a crisis caused by the island nation&#39;s aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and system constraints.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after Government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
&quot;The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,&quot; Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency relief for election services.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract treatments, are expected to clear the backlog.
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-hospital care, residency training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
&quot;These investments are in line with ideas that affected clinicians have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system,&quot; said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member commission is established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if &quot;it is not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmania&#39;s public health system on a more sustainable course.&quot;
That said, he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
&quot;I&#39;m confident that the federal grants will go a long way toward taking the state&#39;s public health system off the list of concerns,&quot; Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral performances will largely offset recent cuts.
But the opposition&#39;s federal health spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes today&#39;s announcement is just a &quot;band-aid&quot;.
&quot;The reason we are where we are today is because the Labor state government has drained $430 million from the health care system,&quot; he told ABC TV.
It can&#39;t be that a state government rips nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends that&#39;s good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
In protest against the planned tax on the wealthy, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without result.
In the conflict over the tax on the wealthy, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered themselves into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President François Hollande received club and association representatives on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to exempt football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained firm.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said the head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled between November 29 and December 2 are therefore cancelled.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women&#39;s breakfast of the year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen.
Topics of the day in the parish hall were &quot;Proverbs from the Bible&quot; and &quot;Idioms from the Middle Ages&quot;.
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the parish council, went into the biblical proverbs in a lecture.
&quot;Proverbs contain wisdom, regulations or warnings,&quot; she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She used proverbs like: wooden eyes be on the alert, scales fall from your eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker asked her listeners to guess which proverb it was.
The parish councilor Christel Dehner took on the idioms from the Middle Ages: All good things come in threes, make you blue, beat something up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the idioms, which she called &quot;bridges into the past&quot;.
At the end of the day, a raffle was drawn.
The prizes were laid out on a table and humorously described before being presented to the winners.
Mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger also mingled with the visitors to the breakfast group.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker after God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
The relationship on the outside is amazing: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And in the same way that Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the explorer and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is well regarded in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is sold by Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress coupled with paranoia, security obsession and the belief in being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Book of Revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had wreaked havoc on his brain.
He understood early on that computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human being from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That&#39;s the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is especially significant now.
The &quot;Minority Report&quot; dates from 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of &quot;pre-crime&quot; is developed here, that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick&#39;s world, which is frighteningly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police take action.
&quot;We record individuals who have not violated any law,&quot; says the head of the agency.
&quot;We catch them before they can commit a violent crime.&quot;
And: &quot;There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penal camp full of pseudo-criminals.&quot; You read streams of time.
They assume that bad things will happen and prevent the criminal idea from becoming a reality.
Dick&#39;s story acts as the blueprint for the NSA&#39;s anti-terror laws and wiretapping frenzy.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama&#39;s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick&#39;s story isn&#39;t over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It&#39;s perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own premises.
Not only accepts mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means, again and again, getting closer to the truth.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-frisk policy
A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday blocked an order by a judge calling for changes to the New York City Police Department&#39;s stop-and-frisk program, releasing the judge from the case.
The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin&#39;s decisions would be stayed pending a decision on the city&#39;s appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution by the way it implemented the program for stopping and questioning people.
The city appealed its assessment and the corrective actions it ordered, including the decision to create a monitoring agency to help police change their policy and related training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension requested on Tuesday.
The appeals report stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges, which stipulates that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was justified in part by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court&#39;s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by improperly targeting black and Hispanic men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an outside body to oversee the implementation of major changes, including policy, training and oversight reforms, and ordered a pilot program of body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most inspections were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people released after a police stop.
A hearing on the city&#39;s appeal is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Stops of this type have existed in various forms for decades, but during the non-party Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#39;s tenure, the number of stops recorded rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic men.
In 2004, four men, all from minorities, filed a lawsuit that grew into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD&#39;s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as impact how other police departments implement the rule.
Opponents say the changes will dampen police morale but not crime; it would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after thousands of jobs have been lost over the past decade.
The judge noted that she is not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but is merely reforming the way the NYPD enforces the controls.
Anger at verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted with anger at the verdict of the last of the instigators to be tried, believing Umar Patek should be summarily shot.
Patek, who has been on the run for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia&#39;s most wanted persons, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bomb attack.
With a suspended sentence, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta&#39;s popular tourist area that left 202 dead, including 88 Australians, and injured many others.
He was also found guilty on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a spate of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence, although they could have asked for the death penalty for the man, nicknamed the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the other guys&#39; footsteps.
&quot;He should be put in front of a firing squad,&quot; Corteen told AAP.
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled when just after 11pm on October 12, 2002, a massive bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy&#39;s Bar where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber detonated a backpack full of explosives.
He went into a coma for a month after the attack and &quot;died&quot; three times while on life support.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To let him live - no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds isn&#39;t much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He eluded capture for nearly a decade but was finally apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda boss Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in a bid to re-establish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
&quot;He didn&#39;t turn himself in,&quot; Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the suffering he has caused other people.
The verdict came ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by commemorations in Bali and Australia.
&quot;There will be a lot of tears this year,&quot; Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
Spying affair about Merkel testifying in Russia
The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor&#39;s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the Interfax agency reported.
The Greens member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
Leg almost chopped off: Rocker process reissued
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily harm and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun in the Frankfurt (Oder) district court.
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were initially silent.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the Bandidos at the time.
The public prosecutor accuses them of stabbing and hitting three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices.
All victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about turf wars and a demonstration of power.
The two accused were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators wore masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice reversed the verdict after the public prosecutor&#39;s office appealed and referred it back to the district court for a new hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in prison for another crime.
At the start, the main focus was on reconstructing what happened on the night of the crime.
The commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited as a witness.
The focus was on cell phone conversations between the accused and other people that the police had listened to.
The difficult thing is that rockers almost always adhere to a law that is iron for them in court - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims unpacked.
When asked, public prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the public prosecutor&#39;s office in Frankfurt (Oder) said that new evidence had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
Pamela Anderson sheds her legendary blond locks and appears for the first time with a new bob haircut.
Pamela&#39;s blonde locks have been famous since her role in the TV series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has ditched her long blonde tresses in favor of a short platinum blonde haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look in Los Angeles on Wednesday and also posted a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It&#39;s the first time the blonde sex symbol has had short hair in 20 years, and we&#39;re loving the demure change.
What do you think of Pammy&#39;s hair?
Let us know what you think in the comments below.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, &quot;we would have hoped for more,&quot; says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy office manager of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Because numerous companies have so far reacted cautiously to hiring.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: &quot;We have hardly any skilled workers in the trades, in the health sector and in geriatric care&quot;.
Depending on the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been coming in again since September.
The winter season there begins in mid-December.
You can find the entire background report on this in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of October 31, 2013 (page 33).
Traffic light permanently red: Pay attention to the waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just won&#39;t turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react or the light signal is defective.
What to do then - drive on red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine &quot;Motorrad&quot;.
However, the waiting time must be &quot;reasonable&quot;, which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises waiting at least five minutes before assuming that the traffic light is malfunctioning.
However, anyone who continues to drive despite the red light must be aware that they are fully to blame for any accident caused by it.
Becker warns that anyone who waits less than five minutes may not be waiting long enough, referring to a decision by the Hamm Higher Regional Court.
In the case under discussion, a driver ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but switched to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation – but not the fine.
Bombardier falls profits after falling shipments and orders
Canadian airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc on Thursday reported a 15 percent drop in net profit after being pressured by slower third-quarter plane orders and deliveries and contract problems at its train division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft, or provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use next September, according to its ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has only been followed by three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase will go as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and caused the Toronto Stock Exchange to fall more than 8 percent.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating to &quot;sector perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; on Thursday, citing the stock has limited upside potential over the next quarter to two.
&quot;Although weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin development in the transport sector,&quot; Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft&#39;s testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower end of the market, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and first flew in September after months of delays.
But firm orders for the CSeries so far have been modest at 177 as potential buyers await the results of flight tests and see if the company&#39;s claims of the new jet airliner&#39;s fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential are accurate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 firm orders by the time the jet enters commercial service.
Management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
&quot;The test aircraft was grounded no longer than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft&#39;s downtime.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, with the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Still, analysts remain skeptical that twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer will be able to put a CSeries aircraft into service.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the Plan for Entry into Service (EIS) and will update it over the coming months.
&quot;The slow progress of the flight tests - although they appear to be in line with Bombardier&#39;s internal planning - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Doerksen.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&#39;s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $172 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales dipped slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest planemaker says it delivered 45 planes this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell to 26 from 83 aircraft.
Aerospace backlog at September 30 was $32.9 billion, flat from December 31.
&quot;Aerospace results were within our guidance, but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,&quot; said Beaudoin.
Aerospace sales fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest train manufacturer, announced that sales in this division rose by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The backlog for the transportation division was $32.6 billion as of September 30, up slightly from December 31.
Transportation margins were impacted by execution issues on some large contracts.
According to company management, there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter.
In Thursday afternoon trading, Bombardier&#39;s shares fell 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would join the board.
Brazil&#39;s Embraer SA, the world&#39;s third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier&#39;s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Regulations relating to electronic devices on aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers are still required to turn off tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is allowing U.S. airlines to change their policy so passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in &quot;flight mode&quot;.
Passengers are already allowed to do so for most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books on take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision, which is taking a lot of work for US airlines to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their rules.
Air traffic control authority CASA also said it would look into the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
&quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on aircraft,&quot; it said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, saying it is open to change but would need to be initiated by lawmakers.
&quot;We would welcome a review by CASA of electronic device approvals, which we believe would improve the customer experience now that we offer in-flight (wireless entertainment),&quot; a spokesman said.
Qantas said it would stick to the current rules for the time being.
&quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no plans at this time to change that,&quot; the company said.
FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA&#39;s decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile device interference and amend manuals, training materials, carry-on programs and customer briefings.
&quot;After an airline confirms its fleet&#39;s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude,&quot; the FAA said.
In rare instances of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
The group also recommended stowing heavier equipment securely under the seat or in the overhead compartments during takeoff and landing.
A stubborn ankle injury threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in FSV Mainz 05&#39;s Bundesliga away game at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is struggling to get Nicolai Müller to play.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far he could only do that individually.
&quot;We will decide on his assignment at short notice,&quot; said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old is hoping to have his top scorer with six goals with him.
Because the Mainz team already have to do without the injured top performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors are presented by the district association performance show this weekend in the community center.
The ratings were already made on Thursday
The local association W514 is once again organizing this large exhibition.
Breeders from the clubs in the Soest district show their best animals here, as do young Wicked hobby keepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges assessed the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, since the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
Mayor Hermann Arndt will officially open the exhibition at 2:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle with handsome prizes and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Seriously injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but initially could not say much about the course of the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
What is certain is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came towards her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, and the woman was so badly trapped that it took the fire department almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unclear.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
British police issue Assange with an extradition notice
British police today issued an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had given the 40-year-old Australian a &quot;call to surrender&quot; to appear at a police station, adding that he could face arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex-related charges after his options under UK law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has &quot;served a summons to a 40-year-old man to present himself to a police station at a time we choose,&quot; a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail release.
The embassy did not comment on the service of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the investigative website WikiLeaks.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the &quot;German Mass&quot; by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical &quot;Rock my Life&quot;, which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the wreath of songs will enrich two church services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of Franz Schubert&#39;s Deutsche Messe.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 7 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. during the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title &quot;Songs for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass&quot;, D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time it was written.
The mass is performed as part of the church services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on how a dog&#39;s tail wag is related to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog&#39;s perspective), while nervous dogs wagged their tails to the left.
But now scientists say other dogs can sense and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.&quot;
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, like in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left side movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to their fellow dogs wagging their tails sideways, the researchers monitored the animals while they watched videos of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed their behavior.
We&#39;ll probably soon understand why the tail sometimes moves one way and sometimes the other
Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We showed the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate other distracting aspects and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right.&quot;
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog wag its tail to the right (from the wagging dog&#39;s perspective), they remained completely relaxed.
However, when the tail tilt was predominantly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs don&#39;t intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that the dogs learned from experience which movements to worry about and when not to.
He said, &quot;When you have multiple encounters with other dogs and wagging your tail in one direction is more likely to be associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react based on those experiences.&quot;
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their pet&#39;s emotions.
John Bradshaw, a canine behavior expert and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol&#39;s Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to look at whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they&#39;re looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when they&#39;re looking at a contented dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: &quot;Dogs are more likely to approach a robotic dog when its &#39;tail&#39; wags to the left rather than to the right, rather than fidgeting -- exactly the opposite of what it was in the Italian study.&quot;
He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies didn&#39;t interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
&quot;While there is considerable evidence in many different mammals that the two hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined - and dogs are no exception,&quot; Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won&#39;t be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves one way and sometimes the other.
Tony Blair has said he would jump at the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old shared his views on various domestic issues.
Since resigning in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, confining his comments mostly to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Middle East Quartet of Peacemakers.
When asked if he would like to return to the prime minister&#39;s post, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: &quot;Yes, sure, but that&#39;s unlikely to happen, so...&quot;
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers recover charred corpse
The fire brigade had to move out in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.

The emergency services went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not immediately clear.
Constance: Cyclists hit 63-year-olds

UN announces new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations is now beginning work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction announced 12 years ago.
Ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off in Rio de Janeiro that evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for &quot;Sustainable Development Goals&quot; to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document that will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to &quot;think beyond national interests&quot;.
&quot;I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal, sustainable development goals,&quot; he said.
“These goals will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the Millennium Goals.&quot;
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, federal chairman of the Greens, has now also got involved in the ongoing discussions about the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;I think it&#39;s wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart Music Academy,&quot; Özdemir told the &quot;Stuttgarter Nachrichten&quot;.
Jazz and classical belong together in the jazz location Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who is considered the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the federal elections on September 22, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
According to this, among other things, the jazz and pop course of studies is to be relocated from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
Pawn shops boom in Singapore as crisis hits middle class
At a pawn shop in Singapore&#39;s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga trades a gold bracelet, ring and pair of earrings to pay for her daughters&#39; school fees.
&quot;My husband and I just bought a house, all my money is in it,&quot; says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (approx. 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia -- where household debt is mounting -- that ValueMax, where it made its swap, became the third pawn shop to list on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
Pawning jewelry is not only a quick way to get money — S$1,300 in Janani Amirthalinga&#39;s case — it&#39;s almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an APR of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent charged by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no credit checks or proof of income are required, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
That&#39;s why millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs and mounting household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and easy credit thanks to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, lower- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to make up the difference in a faltering economy.
This week, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s identified growing household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks&#39; creditworthiness.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in relation to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed ongoing weakness in exports and a slacking in consumer demand.
&quot;The bottom line is that as costs rise, people in the middle to lower bracket (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,&quot; says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have fueled the trend toward pledging personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of pawned items at the city-state&#39;s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say to themselves, &quot;Gold prices are looking good, let&#39;s pawn grandmother&#39;s gold chain and get it back next month.&quot;
Thailand&#39;s largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers at its branches in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, is looking to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia - where the company has four stores - but also outside of Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, managing director by ValueMax.
The company is funding it with 60 percent of the $66 million it raised in the Singapore IPO this week.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire for high interest rates, Yeah explains that not only do pawnshops offer cheaper rates than other lenders, but they don&#39;t directly add to the debt.
&quot;Customers are lending on items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables doesn&#39;t increase household debt,&quot; she explains.
The pawnbroking business is increasingly being socially accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn shops are in financial difficulties.
Rich Singaporeans also come to ValueMax stores to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, receiving up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social class.
&quot;These include wealthy people borrowing short-term for a business or investment, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,&quot; says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick scolding for referees: Mane no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the &quot;Bulls&quot; was just as disappointed by the referees.
&quot;There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of kings of swallows,&quot; he defended the two offensive whirlwinds at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent reason for Rangnick&#39;s criticism was a yellow card for Mane in the 3-0 win against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was doomed by an alleged act - which of course wasn&#39;t, as the TV pictures showed.
&quot;A blatant wrong decision,&quot; said Rangnick, who described the referee as &quot;completely overwhelmed&quot; Harkam.
Harkam also &quot;played his part&quot; in the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: &quot;I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation&quot;.
Schmidt himself claims he had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don&#39;t know why.
&quot;Because I&#39;m the one who was insulted,&quot; emphasized the 46-year-old.
In view of the successful run, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
&quot;There are only two words for that: Really good,&quot; he stated.
There isn&#39;t much to complain about.
The way the team plays is particularly impressive.
It should go on like this.
There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
&quot;Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club,&quot; Rangnick clarified.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2 Ltd work proposes to have high speed links between Scotland and the north of England as early as 2026 when Phase 1 begins.
Transport Secretary Baroness Kramer said the project &quot;will bring Britain closer together&quot;.
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the UK Government on the plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase 2 is complete there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail link between London and the north of England to £42.6 billion from £32.7 billion.
The UK Government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and journey time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
These include the potential for a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network, bringing the UK and its cities closer together.&quot;
We&#39;re moving forward with HS2 because it brings tremendous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it&#39;s also about the connection between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: &quot;Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;
Speaking on behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown has urged Carmichael to &quot;commit unequivocally&quot; to Scotland&#39;s inclusion on the HS2 network.
Brown said: &quot;The high-speed rail link has the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic strength of Scotland makes a case for fast rail links across the UK.&quot;
That is why we are delighted to be working as a partner to the UK Government and to exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will bring benefits to all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with UK ministers next year and together deciding on the next steps.
Living with future prospects
Waltraud Ries actually lives like a dream.
Your house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
&quot;I hope you&#39;re not afraid of spiders?&quot; asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and I for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to climb the many steps to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
Also: since a meniscus operation, the woman in her mid-fifties has had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
She recently published a book on the subject of &#39;Living happily in old age - which type of housing is best for me?&#39;.
&#39;Our apartment is the best example of what&#39;s not possible in old age,&#39; she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Now in his mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of &#39;living in old age&#39;.
Most put it off while they can.
It&#39;s always the others who grow old&#39;, she says with a smile.
Only when the suffering is really great do you think about it.
&#39;By then it can already be too late,&#39; says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
&#39;But which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,&#39; she explains.
T he solution does not exist for old age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also become ill.
And: &#39;Without a good knowledge of the national language you get lonely even in the dolce vita,&#39; the author of the specialist book points out to people who want to emigrate.
Their models include classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often quoted shared flat for pensioners.
As we age, everyone has their quirks and quirks
&#39;But such a shared flat would not be for me,&#39; she says with a wink.
Especially not like in a shared student apartment with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
&#39;When you get old you just need a place to retreat to,&#39; says Ries.
However, the author does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior living community can still function.
But that would have to be different than in the classic student flat share.
And sometimes you just want peace and quiet&#39;, she believes.
At least in the state capital, she is not the only one with this opinion.
&#39;Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible,&#39; is the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the citizens&#39; service for older people in the state capital.
Your office advises people on all aspects of &#39;getting older&#39;.
This is why older people in particular would often put up with inconveniences and limitations just to be able to stay in their familiar surroundings, this is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends everyone who is involved in converting their house or apartment to make them age-appropriate first of all, and not to hire the first craftsman who comes along.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversions.
Even in a rented apartment, one or the other can be implemented, and if it&#39;s just the raised toilet seat, the interior designer explains.
But it is not always possible to redesign an existing apartment to make it age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, no matter how beautifully located it is.
Waltraud Ries had to experience this.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path to the apartment door, which is also paved with stairs, would be the much greater obstacle.
She will keep looking until she finds the ideal property for herself and her husband.
She dreads the move more than the spider on her front door.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service informer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to solve the NSA spy affair, which is becoming more and more explosive.
According to the Greens member of the Bundestag, Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former secret service employee would testify to a German public prosecutor or to an investigative committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine &quot;Panorama&quot;.
Driver seriously injured in accident
A 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath at around 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The vehicles collided.
The man from Aachen suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
After six match days, TSV Morsum is still without a point in the handball association league.
Now, of all times, Ingo Ehlers&#39; team is facing a derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first win last weekend.
With this game the season starts anew for us.
&quot;I hope that we can finally clear our heads,&quot; Ehlers is cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden also relies on speed play.
So we have to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to improve the coverage, which has recently left anything but a secure impression.
Daverden&#39;s coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re the favourites, because anything can happen in a derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be absent.
On the other hand, youngster Joost Windssss, who plays doubles for the A-Youth Bundesliga club HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in a game like this should stay at home.
Lawyer addicted to cocaine who warned drug lord about police investigation faces jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld giant Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense attorney who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation for fear his secret drug addiction would be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided crime lord Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
Hailed as &quot;top notch&quot; by criminal investigators, the lawyer, nicknamed &quot;Bash,&quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he represented in a previous drug case.
Officials saw Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the barrister&#39;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular Class A drug user after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months, between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
All four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized £1.5m worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction would become public.
Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court today after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice and sentenced.
He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police investigations into Scarborough revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta&#39;s house and place the 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under the attorney&#39;s garbage can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football ground in Ewood Park.
The attorney returned home, retrieved the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was revealed in court that Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after tests found Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claiming their discussion was covered by &quot;attorney-client privilege.&quot;
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and attempted to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken.
When questioned by the police, he stated that he had an office at both his home and work address and that clients called him at home for legal matters.
It was revealed in court that he had called key drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and shared what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone not to break the law.&quot;
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney for becoming too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of what he said was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the attorney for those people.
But this went well beyond the bounds of a normal attorney-client relationship.
He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, notably Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I&#39;m not, and I wanted to give Scarborough information, I wouldn&#39;t wait 15 hours, I would do it right away.&quot;
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: &quot;Mr Ditta made the transition from a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals.&quot;
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading organized crime figures who hired him to gather valuable information about a police investigation.
Lawyers must uphold the highest standards of integrity and inspire trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire&#39;s Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta which also resulted in a conviction on three counts of cocaine possession and obstruction of justice, underscoring our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We&#39;ll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other drug traffickers were sentenced to total terms of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta posted a Q&amp;A section about himself, stating that his dream job is to be a lawyer representing clients on death row in America, his ultimate dinner guest is Mohammed Ali, and that inequality is the motivation behind his Work.
To date, the Kempten police station can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to the egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and removed the remains of the eggs immediately, no property damage should have occurred.
Furthermore, some New Year&#39;s Eve firecrackers were probably set off in the city area, but there was no property damage here either.
A resident on Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel covers were stolen.
However, by the time the police arrived, the man had found all of his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take any further action.
A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV &quot;Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker&quot; had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubhouse of the &quot;Witteborg&quot; restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness dedicated to music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right celebration to honor people.
This time secretary Rolf Wagener was happy about the special award &quot;Singer of the Year&quot;.
&quot;You not only wrote down a lot for us, but also did quite a few laps for us, for which we thank you very much,&quot; said the chairman of the choir, Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to choirmaster Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year&#39;s &quot;Singer of the Year&quot; Friedrich Winkler, each with 42 participations.
Artur Brückner, the grade manager, took fifth place.
The board of directors gave a special thank you to the team led by the club&#39;s landlady, Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a first-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decorations.
The MGV &quot;Friedrich-Wilhelm&quot; meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7:45 p.m. in the clubhouse.
&quot;We always welcome new singing voices,&quot; says Schlotmann.
Council targets track systems
Should the &quot;Am Hirschen&quot; level crossing be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to pay 220,000 euros for this.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, safety at level crossings is to be increased - collisions of trains with other vehicles regularly occur nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute a third of the costs, the rest is shared by the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach&#39;s master builder Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the level crossing &quot;Am Hirschen&quot; to the municipal council.
The city is planning to build a bulge there west of the railway tracks at the level of the mouth of the tunnel there.
Larger vehicles, for example those transporting long timber, could also park there in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore suggested constructing a required retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjoining street in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councilors questioned the need for widening the road: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: &quot;Do we have to spend so much money because of so few vehicles?&quot;
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The level crossing &quot;Hirschen&quot; is regularly used for transporting long timber.
Even wood from the &quot;Kuhbach&quot; area is sometimes transported over this route because the vehicles, which are up to 20 meters long, cannot use the route at the Häberles Bridge because they cannot turn onto the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the &quot;Am &quot;Hirschen&quot; level crossing could also be of important transport importance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of widening the road.
Irrespective of this, the conversion of the level crossing was approved by a majority, with the stipulation that the required retaining wall be built in such a way that the city could expand the adjoining road in the direction of &quot;Bahnhofstraße&quot; to around 5.5 meters if necessary for oncoming traffic.
The conversion of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could result in a completely different problem, which affects the access to the steep &quot;Geroltzhäuser Weg&quot;.
The administration had the railway conversion plans examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection to Geroltzhäuser Weg would then still be possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the gradient of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting on it.
The city, in turn, is responsible for this as the road construction authority.
The conversion could therefore result in liability disputes.
Haas argued that since both the wood removal and turning work in the current state of development, the conversion of the level crossing should not be approved.
At this point, the risk of the train colliding with a vehicle standing on the level crossing is also significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because the Mitte stop is right next to it, with which there is a good line of sight.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down at this point so that there was no risk of a collision.
The majority of the remodeling of this level crossing was refused approval because the city of Schiltach &quot;would have to pay for the problem with vehicles that were riding on it&quot;, according to the councillors, since the railways could withdraw from responsibility once the construction work had been completed.
The committee sees the conversions at the &quot;Vor Heubach&quot; and &quot;Vor Kuhbach&quot; level crossings, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railways, as unproblematic.
Gazprom&#39;s Alexei Miller describes the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, said Gazprom&#39;s board of directors.
&quot;Today&#39;s event is a milestone: construction work has started on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia&#39;s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia&#39;s gas destined for Europe is stored, puts conventional routes at risk, officials say.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated &quot;forever&quot;.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes live in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other downstream countries on the planned route should start by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Vienna Airport eliminates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more announcements like these at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are thus eliminated - the noise level is to be reduced significantly.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by stopping announcements that affect individuals.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, for example, are already doing without the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls are heard through the loudspeakers a day - things should be quieter at the airport in future.
&quot;Experience has also shown that these individual announcements were relatively little noticed, but at the same time all other information about changed gates or departure times is a bit lost here,&quot; said Kleemann in an interview with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a compere at the Palace Theater on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation to tell.
Fay&#39;s innovation has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Initiated and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
&quot;Most of these headliners started out with Carolines and then went from strength to strength until they were too well known to perform in a club,&quot; Hirsch said.
We conceived this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year&#39;s event features performances from Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes,&quot; an annual music and comedy fundraiser for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform.
The world of comedy has grown with the festival.
A number of the comedians taking part in this year&#39;s festival have gained notoriety through more unconventional channels, such as showings on smaller TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame with a cable television sitcom (the tongue-in-cheek fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a cast member on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other distinctively voiced young comedians (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the tongue-in-cheek, racially-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets at the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian but has grown into a respected TV and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show called &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg&quot; on TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
&quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry&#39;s work,&quot; Steinberg said.
He told me that when he&#39;s here he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks to himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I&#39;ll live here.
On the last weekend in August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is firmly in the hands of children again.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children&#39;s and family festival with numerous hands-on activities and events.
&quot;Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days,&quot; says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
Regional craftsmen are on hand to help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
People also work in the museum workshop.
The young guests can put their manual skills to the test by building cuckoo whistles, water wheels or spinning tops.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or walking on stilts, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all little detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday at 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.
On a tour of the site, the children have to guess which stories are true or which are lies.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be up to his practical jokes with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner&#39;s is cozy and fairytale-like.
At 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., the storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales.
In addition, the children&#39;s costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom maker, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder at their traditional work.
A varied holiday program awaits visitors to the open-air museum until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the President of the State Parliament, Guido Wolf, was also in Titisee-Neustadt to find out where the workforce of tomorrow will come from.
In the support center in the Black Forest, he investigated this important question together with the managing directors of the vocational schools and the district high school and the chairmen of the parents&#39; council.
&quot;Education is an important location factor,&quot; underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans Thoma School, which presented the networked school project Education Center Black Forest.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the support center, district high school and vocational school center in the forest town.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
&quot;It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, the phase of caring for relatives,&quot; explained Wolf.
He also stated that more and more employees took care of the care and support of their relatives.
&quot;Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of employment,&quot; said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
&quot;Because those who have already got to know the advantages of the region during their studies often remain in the regional economy with the knowledge and skills they have acquired, which contributes to strengthening the region,&quot; said the President of the State Parliament with conviction.
The demand for skilled workers can only be met if sufficient training places are offered.
In his opinion, the locational advantage of the district is its advantageous location in south-west Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand local public transport.
&quot;Remain persistent and make sure that local public transport gets better,&quot; he said to the local politicians present.
Australian appeals Thai jail sentence
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely claiming she was raped by a taxi driver has appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the early hours of Sunday June 10 , while two other men held her.
Later, however, video camera footage showed that she had made it safely to her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody at the scene until the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult women&#39;s prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rubgy league player who has contacted the Foreign Office in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; about his daughter&#39;s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
&quot;We&#39;re obviously very concerned, but we hope she&#39;ll be home as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to Australian reports, she is meanwhile vacationing in the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court said Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had warned the appeal could result in a higher sentence of up to two years in adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could be trying to improve its tarnished tourism image and that an acquittal could result.
Painted the site fence on the Bechtle property
A group from the &quot;Schweizer Wiese&quot; citizens&#39; initiative has beautified the site fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, because the area is in danger of slipping.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, discussed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
A banner with the message &quot;We are in favor&quot; was put up before the BI action.
However, that didn&#39;t bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens&#39; initiative in their campaign.
Their motto on the big poster was &quot;We are against building ruins&quot;.
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the huge project fail one day.
In conversations with many passers-by in front of the &quot;construction site&quot;, it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the city&#39;s project, although quite a few have the same questions about the dimensions of the project presented as BI.
But they are beginning to give up because the city is still delaying these answers, the BI says.
As has been heard, the mayor&#39;s public statements are also having an effect.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal baths if the population voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Schweizer Wiese in the referendum.
Some appear to be downright frightened because of this, while others see it as a &quot;blatant attempt at blackmail&quot; on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key facilities producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said Thursday, while heavy clashes erupted in the north of the country near one of the sites suspected of storing toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline on
November 1 set by The Hague-based organization Damascus to destroy or render &quot;inoperable&quot; all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and loading ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is a major milestone in an ambitious timeline aimed at eliminating all of Syria&#39;s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
There are believed to be around 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was raging Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say has a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said Thursday 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad&#39;s army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country.
Assad&#39;s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger chemical weapons inspectors face as their mission to rid Syria of its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time amid a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team &quot;is now confident that they have seen and witnessed the destruction of all key manufacturing and blending/filling facilities identified by Syria.&quot;
Therefore, &quot;no further inspection activities are currently planned.&quot;
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections, visiting 21 out of 23 sites specified by Damascus.
Visits to two facilities were not possible due to safety concerns, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been &quot;abandoned... and the chemical weapons program assets there had been moved to other named facilities, which were inspected,&quot; according to the Syrian statement.
It was not immediately clear if the Safira site was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were not able to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
&quot;I salute the bravery and courage you all have shown in accomplishing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,&quot; said Ahmed Uzumcu, director-general of the monitoring organization in a commentary released by the OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad&#39;s government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites, a splinter group of Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, monitoring group head Rami Abdurrahman said there was a powerful explosion at an air defense facility in Syria&#39;s coastal Latakia province on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is a further indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations on the currency market is picking up speed.
Some of the world&#39;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed they are cooperating with authorities in investigations into the world&#39;s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation that the Libor interbank scandal has sparked.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
&quot;Our investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation alleged that RBS passed on the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a previous trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
That trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been furloughed from his current position as European head of spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was furloughed this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly head currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher&#39;s instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS said this week it has taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged FX market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers colluded in transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through years of instant messages and emails looking for instances of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations has roiled traders in what has been one of the most profitable of investment banks&#39; trading units in recent years, but has come under pressure this year as low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators .
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that the sprawling and highly liquid forex market is nearly impossible to manipulate, but leading traders say that&#39;s not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use by banks of their own in-house platforms mean that &quot;even with very small ticket prices you can influence the market&quot;.
The news came on the same day as Credit Suisse said it had fired a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The bank promptly informed the responsible authorities and is cooperating with them.
&quot;We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained,&quot; Credit Suisse said.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his &quot;handsome special counsel&quot; Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby&#39;s voicemails and followed her, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court learned.
&quot;According to prosecutors, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not someone who stands outside people&#39;s homes hoping to catch them in the act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction &#39; Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three techniques to investigatively research stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second one, the surveillance, it can&#39;t be any other way.
How about the first?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, &quot;Did he know about it?&quot;
Rumors of a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW&#39;s features editor when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time, she&#39;s dating Charles.&quot;
A tape of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was recovered from Mulcaire&#39;s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective&#39;s computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as &quot;projects.&quot;
While the investigation was being conducted, Pawlby&#39;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw surveillance of Pawlby&#39;s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail that said, &quot;I have a story we&#39;re going to put out tomorrow that I&#39;d like to talk to Charles about.&quot;
Edis explained Coulson&#39;s activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about having an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking the phone.
Early Puberty: Growing Up Faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe the obesity epidemic is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&#39;s health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter is growing breasts and pubic hair by the age of seven or eight?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Fla., pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
&quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents -- it&#39;s not usually a sign that puberty is about to hit,&quot; Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indicators of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, show up earlier in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (onset of the first menstrual period) over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, slightly lower than 12.75 in 1970.
&quot;Once breast development begins, it&#39;s at least another two to three years before menarche occurs,&quot; said Kaplowitz, also author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
There is some debate as to what actually marks the onset of puberty, but it is considered &quot;precocious&quot; when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates—something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If it is progressing more quickly, testing by an endocrinologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and ward off another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to stunted growth and short stature in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child&#39;s age, speed of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he concedes, &quot;Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavior problems and girls&#39; feelings of being different from their peers.&quot;
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don&#39;t want their very young daughters to have their periods.
&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they&#39;re managing the hygiene side,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter started her period when she was 10.
Even though there were early signs and we&#39;d talked about menstruation, she wasn&#39;t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her group of friends.
There are many well-publicized theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys reach puberty earlier than girls.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic.
He helped conduct a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine linking body fat to puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors at play.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another conundrum: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
&quot;We have to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
&quot;That can mean having to have a conversation sooner than expected,&quot; Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need reassurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes sooner than expected.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In glorious weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the chain of hills around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters in altitude, were numerous amateur cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers from the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placings at the German Championships.
As expected, these two were able to pull away from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again able to place second.
For the women, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leoniedriver from Owingen took second and third place.
One encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
The entire range of athletes was represented, and not just in terms of performance.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year even more absolute top athletes were at the start.
Four drivers were able to break away from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Together with a team colleague, Pangerl has twice been world champion in twelve-hour driving.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Also present was Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude difference, the finish line in front of the Drei-Seen-Halle came in a blink of an eye.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just a second behind, the experienced Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third overall.
In the women&#39;s classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Israeli warplanes strike target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target was but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile shipments in Syria at least twice this year.
Before the district derby against Schalke, BVB supporters who had traveled with them with flares caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences.
Before Friday&#39;s Bundesliga game against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - initially.
It was unusual, almost spooky acoustics that the viewer was offered until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
It was mainly the guest fans who could be heard singing.
The south stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself as exceptionally quiet: no singing, no battle cries.
The podium of the capo, who otherwise coordinates the cheering, remained vacant.
And at the very front of the stands, a large flag with the inscription &quot;Stadium ban section&quot; was waving lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to step onto the field did there be brief cheering.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but by no means everywhere.
Nothing moved in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand.
The fact that stadium announcer Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebratory mood.
The capo only climbed onto his podium five minutes before kick-off - and the tension that had been almost tangible until then erupted in a loud scream when Dickel, as usual, asked about the mood in the stands in the stadium.
As always, it was the south stand&#39;s turn - and finally, as usual, this was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call &quot;Derby winner stands up&quot; came from the south stand at the start, everything was back to normal.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters who had traveled with them fired flares into the stands and onto the pitch - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game started late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the top Dortmund ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke&#39;s words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
&quot;There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement,&quot; announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreographing the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
&quot;I banned that,&quot; he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy when it comes to pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various options for punishment - they now have until Tuesday to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
&quot;It will be drastic,&quot; assured Watzke.
It will be interesting to see how the reactions in the south stand turn out.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail actually means electronic letter.
When designing the internet service e-mail, was the secrecy of letters technically implemented in a similar way to conventional mail?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
For this reason, care was not taken in the basic technical protocols to create a stable foundation for an exchange of letters that is safe to listen to.
Therefore, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user &quot;Anna&quot; sends an email to &quot;Benni&quot;, are the two computers connected directly?
In the first step, Anna&#39;s e-mail program or browser sends the e-mail to her service provider&#39;s e-mail server.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run through a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read along on their way through the web?
Most e-mails are read several times by software robots en route.
The sender&#39;s provider usually checks whether the e-mail contains malware as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is annoying and unwanted spam mail, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
With systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming vacation trip, Google can show corresponding links to vacation offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail.
Law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted to prevent it from being read.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to identify who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in mailboxes that are mainly used privately.
While Yahoo Mail&#39;s shares had recently fallen, Google&#39;s GMail was able to increase significantly.
Germany&#39;s largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor&#39;s profession.
The reason for this is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 according to the current situation.
The profession is very attractive for young people today and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine your own work and daily routine.
With Burfien, the regional church has commissioned a full-time pastor for the first time to inspire young people to study theology.
Fewer and fewer young people are currently deciding to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: &quot;God&#39;s voice is quiet, the world is loud&quot;.
The job is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my appointment calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could make a good living from it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a secure employer.
That suits the young people of today, who are not only interested in a career, but in meaningful work.
According to the state church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology studies begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz Mountains, Emsland or Wendland, it could become difficult to fill vacancies in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become President with it.
Royal Commission Hearing: Two YMCA staffers charged before Jonathan Lord allegations of sex crimes
Two New South Wales (NSW) YMCA staff had been charged with child-related sex offenses before allegations were made against Caringbah nanny Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
But in the opening statement to the commission, the YMCA said it had &quot;never dealt with an incident of child sexual abuse within the organization.&quot;
Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offenses and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education teacher was convicted in 1991 of abusing children in his care.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the commission&#39;s assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case but was not aware of the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA&#39;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming &quot;there have been external reviews of the YMCA that have recognized the YMCA as being at the forefront of child safety.&quot;
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was notified that it received the second-lowest rating out of a possible four in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA when he was 21, admitted management failed &quot;from me down&quot; in hiring Lord and failed to ensure employees were aware of their obligations to allow violations of child safety guidelines report.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexually assaulting 12 boys during his two-year stint with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
But Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural issue that prevented staff from reporting Lord&#39;s child safety violations.
Staff said they observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling one he loved it and letting children play with his cell phone .
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the children&#39;s director, Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord&#39;s supervisor at the YMCA Caringbah, was &quot;very intimidating and most of the time was very unapproachable&quot;.
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, it was their friendship with Lord that affected their judgment, which is why they didn&#39;t report him.
Hare said he had communicated his view to the YMCA NSW Board of Directors that the lesson the organization needed to take from the &quot;Jonathan Lord Incident&quot; was &quot;not about reporting&quot; by employees, and the Board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to urge staff to sign non-disclosure agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA children&#39;s services executive director Liam Whitley.
He said this was to avoid contamination of the evidence but was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011, Griffith University professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been &quot;serious problems&quot; with the hiring, screening, onboarding, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20th.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
A sewage canal from Roman times has been preserved below Cologne over a length of around 120 meters.
If you visit Cologne, you cannot avoid the cathedral.
The two towers rise around 157 meters into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne&#39;s underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Center right next to the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: &quot;We start in the underground car park,&quot; says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, so only what was left of the old city wall was left that wasn&#39;t too big.
Most users of the multi-storey car park therefore hurry past the Roman remains and just park their cars.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in parking deck D2.
You can see ruins about five meters high made of palm-sized stones.
&quot;These are remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD,&quot; says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, and this is where the participants descend again into the depths.
Here we experience the official residence of what was once the most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
&quot;The abbreviation stands for &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot;, which in plain German means something like &quot;City under Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult&quot;.
And the Praetorium is the former governor&#39;s palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here over a length of around 120 meters.
&quot;You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want,&quot; Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After fetching the key from the cash desk, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, accessible shaft.
&quot;We are now in the mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath,&quot; he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to access the groundwater that was essential for the ritual ablutions.
To this day, different water levels can be read at the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, due to the changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikveh will be part of an archaeological zone in the town hall square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
However, it will still be a few years before it is completed.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from upgraded brakes, a service package that includes Bowler Works mechanic care and logistical support, to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, states: &quot;The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.&quot;
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure and an attainable route to world-class events.
We are delighted to open this route in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe the format will open up new ways to experience the various disciplines of rallying in the UK and abroad and introduce newcomers to the rigors and realities of rally raiding to prepare.
We really had fun creating the Defender Challenge car - it&#39;s going to be a fun championship.
Additionally, the Defender Challenge has a practice and test day in February and the option to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another independence horror story.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the cue for tales of passport control at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian&#39;s Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde bill did point to the potential economic benefits of being able to travel more freely across the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this didn&#39;t make the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
As Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be just a small concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wants from the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that&#39;s so aged it&#39;s already a fossil: I first heard the &quot;independence means passport controls&quot; duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this age-old story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to European tunes?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the grand post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project officially died.
All over the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to jettison the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded just this year – garnered almost five million votes in September&#39;s general election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of Britain&#39;s Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point.
Because of the tough austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket that sticking to the common currency is forcing national economies into, many people believe the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has locked its members on exchange rates that are favorable to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of a local currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending - spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of Brussels-enacted &quot;green&quot; energy policies - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
That&#39;s a crippling cost disadvantage, as we saw at Grangemouth.
All the wage locks in the world do nothing to protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, particularly in France, once the EU&#39;s cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, with the ailing French economy struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen&#39;s right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a crucial by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to Britain&#39;s Labor Party that it cannot assume a split on the right would automatically benefit the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among working-class white French?
She wants to use next year&#39;s EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – which is very possible – then such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my point: in the not too distant future, growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will converge towards the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not go away, but it will become more like the &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations&quot; favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick with the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in hopes of ingratiating itself with the US.
However, Washington&#39;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can choose to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what to put where.
I suspect Scotland could fare quite well in a looser Europe as long as we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same as Norway and keeping our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - remarkably - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 by rejecting proposed (and implemented) cuts by Labor Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to have austerity policies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Airline Passengers Can Now Use Electronic Devices On Planes (But Can&#39;t Make Cell Phone Calls)
From departure to landing, air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, listen to music and watch movies, but not use their cell phones, according to new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). were published in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage policies to reflect the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
&quot;Depending on the status of the plan, we may authorize expanded use of electronic devices very soon,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed.
You can only start them again when the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
Upon entering the landing approach, passengers must turn them off and not restart them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aviators that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
&quot;If the new rule is implemented safely - and we are working closely with the airline on this - both sides will benefit,&quot; commented Glading.
To be honest, we are tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this topic.
However, Internet connections below three kilometers for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data remain prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was publicly forced off an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked at the gate.
And heavier equipment such as laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has regulatory authority over telephone calls, not the FAA.
FAA May Lift Ban on Certain Electronic Devices During Takeoff and Landing
Last month, National Transportation Safety Board safety expert Mark Rosenker, national transportation safety expert, told CBS News cellphones are still considered a risk.
&quot;Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation devices, but because we at the FCC know that airborne transmissions can also interfere with cell towers,&quot; Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to relax restrictions on its use.
Critics, such as Democratic Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as device usage has become ubiquitous.
Some studies report that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of FM radios being carried by passengers, which was the latest technology at the time, interfering with navigational and communications equipment.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be immune to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers when flying at altitude for a number of years.
The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger planes should be eligible for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today&#39;s electronic devices generally emit far less radio frequency emissions than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you turn the page.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is among the proponents of easing restrictions on passenger device use.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and did a test flight to identify problems, but couldn&#39;t find any.
FAA Advisory Committee members expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he believed the interference from the devices was real, although the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only anecdotal reports from pilots suggesting the devices were interfering with aircraft systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to instruct passengers to turn off instruments during instrument landings in poor visibility.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for today&#39;s highly tech-savvy travelers.
&quot;We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a comfortable passenger experience is not at odds with safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, CEO of the US Travel Association.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo on the search for the &quot;best ham in the world&quot;: The Pro7 star visited Bonndorf for the TV show &quot;Galileo&quot;.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbo fattening is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham that you can get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the &quot;Adler&quot; company in Bonndorf works.
&quot;Germany&#39;s favorite ham&quot;, as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
He only gets inside the factory wearing a hair protector and a smock.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can pick up the microphone.
Jumbo sighted for refreshment at fast food in Waldshut
&quot;Huge amounts of work are done here,&quot; marvel the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what is important when it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with class?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
&quot;I&#39;m curious what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco,&quot; said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in its purest form.
But still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found boneless on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a &quot;submarine&quot;.
The trick: fir branches in the smoke ensure the special taste of the Black Forest ham.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
&quot;Now the disc disappears in the jumbo,&quot; he announces the test meal.
&quot;It&#39;s really delicious,&quot; is the conclusion of the TV star.
Everyone involved can live with that.
Freudenstadt: Rapid actions take hosts by surprise
With a narrow squad, the men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school gym in Reutlingen.
The Älbler were with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
However, it soon became apparent that, also due to their age, they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadt team.
With the hard and placed serves, the Gönningen found it extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played cleanly through the middle of the net by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not there to defend against the block.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of Freudenstadt in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was then won a bit laxly and listlessly to make it 3-0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, there will be a much more powerful opponent in the form of TV Baiersbronn, who clearly prevailed in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and wasted points, especially when receiving the ball; Even with the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical game scenes the overzeal prevented the view for possible point gains.
In this match, which was very balanced in terms of performance, Marcus Blasutto&#39;s TSV team showed great physical commitment and a gratifying commitment from both teams.
Gechingen: Absolute protection is not possible
&quot;We want to involve the residents in the planning at an early stage,&quot; Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the community hall to have the planned measures explained to them, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: &quot;The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council&quot;.
According to Häußler, the flood that hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009 was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future.
A river basin study was commissioned with the neighboring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
&quot;The goal is to protect as many developed plots as possible,&quot; says Häußler.
The planning is based on protection against a flood that is statistically to be expected every 100 years according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account with a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as &quot;HQ 100aKlima&quot;.
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
&quot;There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,&quot; says Häußler.
In order to achieve protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can count on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that funding is only available if an overall concept is implemented.
To achieve this, the municipality relies on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best-case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented to the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the tributary of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
After the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner from the contracted engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that all the measures presented need to work together in order to achieve the desired goal overall.
In addition, one is obliged to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among residents of the old town, who repeatedly suffer from overloading of the sewer network even during normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and that these should not be mixed up.
The municipality is obliged to design the sewer system in such a way that two to three year rain events can be coped with.
Increasing the size of the sewers would cost millions.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name part of the program.
According to the lexicon, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
If you visit the café of the same name on the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve, within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, you don&#39;t have to stay with a pure déjà vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not just mental, but tangible and experience it again and again.
Because it&#39;s fun and simply beautiful.
A look inside Opschlag 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling.
The ultra-modern, but not cold, café ambience looks like a place to relax.
Here, the team, led by the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, spoils the guest with a wide variety of coffee and cocktail varieties.
There are also delicious cakes or individually topped fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café on Opschlag: They ran the &quot;Art Lounge&quot; in Kranenburg.
The sympathetic café lovers hope that the move to Kleve on the Opschlag will attract more visitors.
Not least because of the university.
&quot;We don&#39;t have a specific target group,&quot; emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two would like to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The likeable owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in a wide variety of variations yourself.
expresso fan
Daniel Büttner is more of an Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is a cappuccino drinker.
&quot;A baguette with it - that&#39;s my thing,&quot; she reveals to the NRZ.
There have already been two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbor festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu didn&#39;t benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
&quot;Nice, successful and funny,&quot; said the two 33-year-olds.
But not for everyone.
Maybe that&#39;s why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event evenings: &quot;You can&#39;t please everyone&quot;.
And with an event, I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
That&#39;s why events will tend to be the exception for us.
&quot;We want to disrupt normal operations as little as possible.&quot;
That means: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that is increasingly developing into a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students, who are discovering the gastro mile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
A dispute has erupted between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of economy class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month&#39;s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in economy class - not always the ones airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space holds the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard mandating a minimum seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in economy class, but US arch-rival Boeing says that should be up to airlines to decide.
The row comes as planemakers are vying to sell even larger versions of their long-haul twin-engine planes and expect record orders at the November 17-21 event.
How the rear of the aircraft is configured - particularly whether there are nine or ten seat rows - is critical to the stated economic results that the new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized &quot;777X&quot; will seat 406 people with economy-class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in economy class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often lash out at technical details by advertising in the trade press.
Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to win the race with over 100 orders.
The company recently unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, which showed funders an image of three people squashed together in a restaurant and captioned it, &quot;Would you accept that?&quot;
&quot;Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,&quot; said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
With changing diets, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats haven&#39;t changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 gained 10 percent in weight, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist measurement of the average 21st century American male is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened &quot;jet set&quot; was smaller.
According to Airbus, research has been carried out that shows that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus&#39; figures on seat dimensions and says manufacturers don&#39;t have discretion to decide how airlines balance air fares and facilities.
The company also says that research shows that the in-flight experience depends on more than seat width.
&quot;It really comes down to giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful,&quot; said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don&#39;t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it&#39;s all about elbow room, but for manufacturers, it&#39;s increasingly becoming an issue that can impact sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least $700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a profound impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine designs than the segment leader, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing&#39;s statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still less than currently used ten seat per row machines.
&quot;Boeing is therefore cramming more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicate many passengers are opting for the narrower layout, which could mean cheaper fares.
&quot;Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is, from an economic standpoint, the Airbus offering is driven by the 777 threat,&quot; said Mary Kirby, cabin interiors expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but rather a catalog of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
The world-travelling jet salesmen even carry tape measures to check the facilities at the competition.
Even if they tout comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density configurations for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten rows of seats, but says it has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more cabin adaptability, offering wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the backing of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle, but could detract from the wave of 777X sales.
According to encyclopedias, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but differs from it in very significant ways.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a hearty Edam cheese, these delicacies are not on the vegan menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to not eating meat and fish, vegans refrain from consuming all animal products - honey is also denied.
One might ask what remains, but on closer inspection the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a remarkable wealth of ideas.
&quot;Spreads are very popular,&quot; explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food store, which stocks a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop on Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he can find (almost) everything he needs to live. &quot;In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian&quot;.
Then, around the turn of the century, I took the next step and became a vegan.
&quot;The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes,&quot; says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday things could also be done without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
&quot;I don&#39;t want animals to have to die for me,&quot; says Proctor, expressing the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning for burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products and enthusiasm grew.
&quot;It&#39;s a double bonus,&quot; Proctor says today, &quot;in fact, being vegan isn&#39;t a renunciation, it&#39;s not an asceticism, it&#39;s an enrichment.&quot; Proctor attributes the assumption that changing one&#39;s diet reduces one&#39;s choice of dining options more to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions that make many attempts, no matter how well intentioned, fail.
&quot;The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many people give up quickly, similar to smoking,&quot; Proctor draws up a comparison.
And objects: &quot;Certain tastes cannot be pinned down to animals&quot;.
It&#39;s often the spices or the way it&#39;s prepared that creates the taste.
&quot;But you can also create the same effect in other ways,&quot; explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, which should also taste hearty at times.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that&#39;s legitimate.
&quot;It should taste good, but that&#39;s not just limited to animal food,&quot; says Proctor.
He did not suffer any damage to his health, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
&quot;My blood counts are great, I get checked often,&quot; reveals Proctor.
Many critics of veganism warn in particular about the lack of vitamin B12.
&quot;Because animals are fed on feed rather than grazing, it&#39;s questionable whether the meat you buy in the freezer is high in vitamin B12,&quot; says Proctor.
Vegans also have the option of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
&quot;My B12 levels are fine,&quot; he explains.
Proctor doesn&#39;t have to go far to get food.
After all, staple foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I can find everything I need on site.
Every now and then I buy something special.
&quot;A lot of people overlook the fact that only the ready-made products are expensive, but that&#39;s how it is with &#39;ordinary&#39; ready-made products as we know.&quot;
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed.
&quot;There&#39;s a lot to discover in the home kitchen, and a few little tweaks can produce good, if not better, results,&quot; says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon dioxide instead of egg, Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws with his vegan cheesecake.
The vegan gives family celebrations a new flavor.
It&#39;s dynamic, when you cook together it has a new meaning.
&quot;The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,&quot; says Proctor.
Of course, he was also met with skepticism.
Don&#39;t you like my food anymore?
&quot;Am I supposed to feel bad now for drinking milk?&quot; - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with tact.
&quot;I don&#39;t reject people, I&#39;m part of this society,&quot; Proctor doesn&#39;t want to live in an enclave.
And when you look at it more closely, the everyday world doesn&#39;t seem as vegan-alien as you might think - and vegans aren&#39;t as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
&quot;Many kebab shops offer falafel or a vegetarian yufka,&quot; says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he switches to pasta dishes or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly adapting to this.
&quot;When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,&quot; the New Zealander can spot a development: &quot;You have to talk to people, make them aware of it&quot;.
&quot;If there&#39;s enough demand, they might be inclined to add to the menu,&quot; he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor would like other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on their menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they&#39;re the opposite of exclusive.
&quot;Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,&quot; notes Proctor.
&quot;If you want to avoid food scares, veganism is a surefire way to make most of it impossible in the first place,&quot; says Proctor.
Buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when you learn to understand that peanuts can also contain animal additives as coloring agents, following the ethics seems to quickly give you courage in the face of so many hurdles and traps.
That&#39;s not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: &quot;Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives&quot; explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning products.
&quot;You gradually develop a scanner&#39;s eye and know which signs and logos to look out for. It&#39;s sometimes better to take small steps than to stand still or stumble,&quot; says Proctor.
Veganism is an important moral pointer that hits consciousness.
It may not quite succeed in breaking your habits, but at least it can teach consumers to question their habits critically.
Bayern&#39;s basketball players optimistic despite their first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
&quot;No one can stop us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe over the past two years,&quot; said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at defending champions Olympiacos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In only their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The visitors first managed to convert a 15-point deficit into a lead with 13 minutes remaining before Piraeus turned the game around again.
&quot;We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champions, but then made careless mistakes again,&quot; said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We&#39;re proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers for the Munich team, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put an end to the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More trials are needed before testing in humans, which may take years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said early results are good.
&quot;We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market, but have found their nicotine addiction to be stronger than these approaches,&quot; said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Unvaccinated mice, on the other hand, took a &quot;time-out,&quot; the researchers explained, a sign the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal has said, if a future human vaccine is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, though, smokers would use it to quit.
&quot;They know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine, they won&#39;t enjoy it anymore, and that will help them break the habit,&quot; he says.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned more research was needed.
Guillaume Nicloux&#39;s adaptation of Denis Diderot&#39;s novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also heavier fare than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the action tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of one supremely sadistic matron and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another.
The film never strays into lust or sensationalism - and therein lies its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tormenting penitent shirt for the audience as well.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to spell the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he was sworn in as the country&#39;s first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and Egypt&#39;s fifth head of state since the monarchy was overthrown some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black-robed judges at the court, which sits on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
&quot;We strive for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
&quot;Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,&quot; said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-educated engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has represented Islam since its inception 84 years ago, it was mostly targeted as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the Mubarak-era presidential pageantry, traffic was only momentarily halted to allow the motorcade to cross the usually busy street that the city center contains connects the southern suburbs.
Derided as the Brotherhood&#39;s uncharismatic &quot;spare bike,&quot; his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself as a candidate not just for the Islamists, but for all those who supported the efforts of the 2011 insurgency against the authoritarian Mubarak wanted to bring target.
&quot;Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,&quot; Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wood-panelled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Mursi later went to Cairo University where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was formally greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to at attention.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university&#39;s main auditorium, chanting &quot;The army and the people are one hand.&quot;
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi on Friday took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended last year&#39;s authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers the military council had inherited from the ousted leader.
But by taking the official oath in court rather than in parliament, as is usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi&#39;s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter&#39;s history with the Cäcilia male choir is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was honored.
As usual, Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colors of his male choir.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which he has grown to love.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association and an engraved pewter plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival proceeded as usual: with the MGV Betra, the Salzstetten Liederkranz, the Baisingen singers’ department and the local music association, the Vollmaringer invited a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs like &quot;Im Weinparadies&quot; and &quot;Funny, you brothers&quot;.
To honor their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a little serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#39;s &quot;Bundeslied&quot;.
The men&#39;s singing group Betra also sang classic choral songs such as &quot;Hunters&quot; by Julius Wengert, &quot;Far, far away&quot; by Hubert Goisern and the folk song &quot;When you walk through the valley&quot;.
With its mixed choir and its women&#39;s group - the &quot;Impulschor&quot; - the Liederkranz Salzstetten provided for the women&#39;s quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folk tune &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; and &quot;Eviva Espana&quot; by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the &quot;Impulschor&quot; also resorted to foreign languages: &quot;Liberatio&quot; and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Club came up with &quot;What&#39;s that Schwob?&quot; by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert&#39;s &quot;Bierlied&quot; back to home, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
There was a small side program for the children - &quot;Grandma Hanne&quot; alias Hannelore Stollsteimer put on a puppet show and read a few stories, which kept the children busy at lunchtime.
Frontier Airlines charges carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who wish to stow carry-on luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, though Wednesday&#39;s announcement said passengers could keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead bin, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it charges $25 if the fee is prepaid and $100 for travelers who pay at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&#39;Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at encouraging travelers to arrange payment up front.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to calculate that amount,&quot; she explained.
Airlines began charging first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these have therefore stuffed as much as they can into carry-on luggage, with the result that the overhead bins are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board.
O&#39;Malley said the new fee isn&#39;t really about making money.
It is about Frontier&#39;s most loyal customers, who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline&#39;s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier gate may be allowed one bag for free, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable bag.
O&#39;Malley said Frontier&#39;s website and check-in procedures are changing so that passengers are aware of the fee before they get to the gate.
Frontier&#39;s new carry-on fee will not come into effect until the summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines are happy to resort to them.
They argue that luggage transport costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street are taking the new bag fees as a sign that airlines are making enough money to pay for air travel after years of losses.
So far, however, most have avoided hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge carry-on bags three years ago, followed later by Allegiant Air, another low-cost carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary&#39;s Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the surcharge.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the carry-on fee brings in $50 million annually for Spirit.
Sorensen, who previously held an executive position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew Spirit and was curious what to expect at the gate when passengers were confronted with the company&#39;s unusual carry-on fee.
&quot;The boarding process was among the smoothest I&#39;ve experienced in my aviation career,&quot; he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and physical arguments at the gate.
&quot;The plane was full,&quot; he explained, &quot;and boarding went like clockwork.&quot;
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 they charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The company said passengers who bought soda or juice could keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly tried charging for soft drinks in 2008, but backed out seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier&#39;s move to impose a carry-on fee if passengers don&#39;t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at driving customers to its website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the furthest in this area, though.
In September, the company began awarding half the frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A 1,000-mile Frontier flight booked with a third-party provider will therefore only earn customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively through direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to get a handle on Frontier&#39;s finances as part of the sale of the company.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students from the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we headed straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is particularly attractive in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto &quot;The city never sleeps&quot;, the day ended in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Then we went via the financial center around Wall Street to the Memorial of 9/11.
On the third day, the students were able to get an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373 meter high observation deck of the Empire State Building and enjoy the view.
Then we went through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger briefly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The general economic data is right and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets are benefiting from the country&#39;s economic strength and the country&#39;s good general economic conditions compared to other European countries.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa at Jones Lang LaSalle, at the 9th Immobilientag of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, a look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial real estate is.
In the first three quarters of this year, it gained 31% compared to the same period last year.
In Great Britain the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
&quot;Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates,&quot; said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
Parents of Georgia teen who died in tragic accident believe murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school&#39;s gymnasium, are convinced their son was murdered, the family&#39;s attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, USA, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the stands in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old&#39;s family doubts that.
&quot;They are convinced that their son was murdered,&quot; Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson&#39;s attorney, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
&quot;They think it&#39;s totally illogical, against the laws of physics as well as against common sense,&quot; Crump said.
Rather, they believe the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for their son&#39;s death.
&quot;Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag,&quot; he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson&#39;s death because a number of important issues remained unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death due to a crime?
Moore said so at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, whichever way they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
&quot;I believe there is sufficient basis for a formal investigation,&quot; he said.
Moore told reporters the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died of complications from &quot;positional asphyxiation.&quot;
However, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
&quot;There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, he will have the FBI conduct the investigation.

John Kerry, in unprecedented admission, says US spying has &#39;gone unreasonably too far&#39;
John Kerry hinted at a softening of US defensiveness about its surveillance programs in an unexpected admission, saying the espionage had &quot;gone unreasonably too far&quot; in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for going on &quot;autopilot&quot; when whistleblower Edward Snowden&#39;s explosive revelations about NSA espionage activities became public.
The leaked information has drawn the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: &quot;There is no question that the President and I and others in government have learned of some things that have happened on quasi-autopilot simply because of the ability to which goes back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 9/11.&quot;
He then became the first senior US official to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, &quot;In some cases this has gone unreasonably far.&quot;
Determined to clear things up, the President is conducting a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that abuse is taking place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added, &quot;We&#39;re dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.&quot;
There is a radical extremism in the world that is hellbent on killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we knew in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on counterterrorism efforts, according to the chair of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs declared on Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned by their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration with surveillance by the National Security Agency.
&quot;It is very important to U.S. national security interests that Europeans stay on board in our collective effort against terrorism,&quot; said Murphy, a first-time Senate Democrat and chair of the Senate subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I&#39;m also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together on counterterrorism, despite their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone records in Europe have strained ties with some US allies, although the intelligence chief said this week the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA monitored the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common practice on both sides.
Amid all the hubbub, Murphy said his agency is preparing for the congressional trip to be held this year and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating MEPs are to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said there would be some &quot;serious words.&quot;
He said European governments need to be honest with their people about the kind of spyware they have been using for years.
&quot;While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to come to terms with the fact that we&#39;re not the only ones spying,&quot; Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to grapple with resentments over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and US surveillance activities.
Children&#39;s dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centers in the Zollernalb district are receiving mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Bote would like to support the institutions in realizing their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centers and crèches from the entire Zollernalb district can take part in the campaign.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply to the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the kindergarten construction site campaign.
A jury consisting of representatives from the Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be able to be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (campaign) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many hard-working construction workers.
What is the action day and the helpers all about?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave plans because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit.
The mining tycoon, who is in a court battle over paying a $6 million carbon tax, made the allegation as he sought to brush off questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate vital to deciding whether or not to cut or scrap carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer maintained that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott&#39;s daughters would personally benefit from the legislation.
&quot;He has a huge conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a vested interest in whether or not she gets paid leave,&quot; Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax&#39;s Sunshine Coast seat by a margin of 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for an overhaul of the vote counting process to make it faster.
Tony Abbott&#39;s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting?
&quot;We need a better system,&quot; he said.
Why shouldn&#39;t we have a system where you walk in, put the data into a computer, dial immediately, and then at 6:30 p.m. have the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Do you use them because then you can erase the results if you don&#39;t like them?
Voting with pencils these days is amazing.
The Electoral Commission has been examining options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy includes an international airport serving the Sunshine Coast and that he takes his new role &quot;very seriously.&quot;
Public office is about serving the public.
&quot;We seek no reward other than that of history, that of being able to serve this community at a critical time,&quot; he said.
Esa decides on big space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European space agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the running.
distant worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets near other stars.
Nobody knows whether there is life on at least some of them.
The choice is difficult: should one look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
Those responsible at the European space agency Esa are asking themselves these questions.
For their &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; program, they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that should decisively advance research.
The budget for such &quot;L missions&quot; is around one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees examine the proposals and follow up with the researchers.
A final decision is to be made by the scientific program committee in the next few days.
Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; program initiated in 2007 should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the &quot;Cheops&quot; space telescope is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be examined more closely.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for &quot;biomarkers&quot;: gases that are considered indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information about the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined as examples.
With the &quot;Solar Orbiter&quot;, Esa has already approved an M-class mission (the budget there is around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the Sun&#39;s surface and activity.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this, Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the &quot;Cosmic Vision&quot; program.
The &quot;Juice&quot; probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she arrives at Jupiter and is assigned to study the planet&#39;s atmosphere and the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come about and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the big bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, from which stars, planets and living beings like us are made, there is dark matter, the gravitational force of which holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, the effects of which accelerate the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers know neither which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With &quot;Euclid&quot;, Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, &quot;E-Lisa&quot;, a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being approved as an L-mission.
Physicists understand this to mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
To date, they have not been proven.
Elisa could make it, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
In contrast to facilities on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called &quot;Athena&quot;, which, among other things, is intended to explore black holes, &quot;Icy Planets&quot;, another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, &quot;Prism&quot;, a mission to Measurement of the cosmic background radiation, and the &quot;Exoplanet Finder&quot;, which is intended to detect and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals for transporting samples back from Mars, for exploring the moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics have already been eliminated.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for managing children&#39;s food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines the US government has issued, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among faculty and staff about food allergies and how to manage children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools stock epinephrine - the EpiPen brand auto-injector is the most commonly used - to counteract a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislatures recently changed regulations to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine.
Also included in the report is a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, &quot;It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,&quot; &quot;My tongue feels like there&#39;s a hair on it,&quot; or &quot;My tongue tingles.&quot;
Firefighters called to rescue a puppy stuck 15 meters off the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered in her predicament by a walker in the quarry
Firefighters abseiled down the rock face and saved the dog from certain death
Firefighters managed to rescue a puppy that was stuck on a 15-metre ledge in a rock face.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived on her own for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and say thank you to firefighters from the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the minor traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday, a walker walking his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 50-foot (15-meter) ledge in the quarry.
Cleckheaton Fire Station&#39;s technical rescue team rushed to the scene and rappeled to the rescue of Ruby, who was then transported upstairs in a dog crate.
Technical rescue team specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position.
She was in the middle of the cliff - 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
She didn&#39;t move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen rigid.
But now she&#39;s fine.
She then ate some dog biscuits.
That was quite an unusual mission.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: &quot;Ruby was extremely lucky.&quot;
There was a chance she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, who found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;Watching the rescue was scary.&quot;
I couldn&#39;t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in my arms again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion got too much and she collapsed, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We&#39;re just so grateful and every one of them has been absolutely amazing.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, &quot;We were afraid it would fall but it stayed up.&quot;
The firefighters were great.
I can&#39;t believe where she was.
US border: &quot;Super tunnel&quot; for drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a &quot;super tunnel&quot; used for drug smuggling.
According to US customs officials, the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
According to the information, the tunnel had not yet been put into use.
&quot;These cartels are stupid if they think they can sneak under the radar,&quot; Southern California Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a news conference outside a San Diego warehouse where the spotted one end of the tunnel had been.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured: &quot;If you keep building tunnels like this and trying to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money&quot;.
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in an ongoing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in drug-related crimes in Mexico.
Constructed by experts
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters down to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He would have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the marijuana confiscated.
All three face the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006, it said at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the &quot;desperation&quot; of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the US.
No details were given about those arrested, at least one was Mexican, it said.
They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama&#39;s backtrack on health policy
Yesterday, after severe criticism, President Obama backed down on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: &quot;If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.&quot;
In recent days, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public after hundreds of thousands received letters of resignation from their insurer.
Obama qualified his original promise yesterday.
&quot;The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep it,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the widespread media coverage of the layoffs, Obama urged Americans who received such notices to look to the open market for new insurance.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or less than projected.
&quot;They&#39;re coming for a better deal,&quot; he said.
The government said it was unsurprising that the 5 percent of the population who have their own insurance had to look for another plan because their contract didn&#39;t meet new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
&quot;I want to say straight to these Americans, they deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said at a testimony before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been &quot;miserable&quot; since October.
&quot;I&#39;m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,&quot; she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This comment by an irate Sebelius to an aide sitting behind her at yesterday&#39;s House of Representatives hearing was recorded after a dispute with Republican Rep. Billy Long of Missouri. The issue was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long repeatedly pestered Sebelius to ask why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act didn&#39;t voluntarily give up federally-sponsored insurance in favor of purchasing a plan from HealthCare.gov that they now sell to millions of Americans wool.
Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;Gender undetermined&quot;.
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare the gender of such children, but can indicate &quot;undetermined&quot; or &quot;undetermined&quot; on the birth certificate.
The law aims to relieve pressure on parents to avoid making hasty decisions about newborn sex assignment surgeries and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, &quot;I&#39;m neither male nor female,&quot; according to the BBC.
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mangled and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born neither a boy nor a girl each year.
They belong to the intersex group, a group that falls under the diagnosis of &quot;Sexual Differentiation Disorder&quot; (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that if determination is not possible, one should use the best available information on gender assignment and not wait for the child&#39;s psychological and physical development before deciding - if at all - to have an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good thing&quot;.
Intersex children present an ethical dilemma.
&quot;Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don&#39;t,&quot; he said.
One can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait and see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops their gender identity in the first place is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It&#39;s like the secret of why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not based on gender but on their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These traits were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts, and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace and the extent of harassment, violence and bias-related crime.
Gender mismatched boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or &quot;third gender&quot; on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world&#39;s first &quot;sexless&quot; person after a court allowed lifelong retention of &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will in future have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news item on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition demanding that &quot;gender theory&quot; be removed from school textbooks.
US website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, citing: &quot;When the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of human rights.&quot; Civilization.&quot;
The mother of a newborn Maryland told Baby Zone that she would prefer babies to be gendered at birth.
&quot;Being a parent is stressful enough on its own, especially when you don&#39;t know the sex of your child,&quot; she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethics of surgery are being questioned, now that we know the complexities of gender identity and that doctors can be wrong because they don&#39;t know how the child will feel growing up with the gender they have assigned.
&quot;In the mid-20th century it was called a &#39;psychiatric emergency,&#39;&quot; said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not the psychiatrist who was called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender is malleable.
He coined the term &quot;gender identity,&quot; arguing that social and environmental cues -- how parents raise a child -- interact with a child&#39;s genes and hormones to shape whether a person considers themselves male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as &quot;John/Joan,&quot; his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was severed in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and remove his testicles as well, and then raise him as a girl.
&quot;Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but it wasn&#39;t,&quot; said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he reverted to male gender and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the internet, survivors of these sex surgeries have come out &quot;not happy with the results.&quot;
Take Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
Doctors weren&#39;t sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he&#39;d never be able to have a &quot;satisfactory life&quot; as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he started receiving female hormones.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was due to have a vaginal plastic surgery.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with DSD which left his body unable to produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he reverted to male identity, receiving testosterone injections and having his breasts removed.
The operation left him infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to ensure that intersex people are seen as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law may &quot;encourage labeling and stigmatization.&quot;
&quot;Many activists are concerned that the German decision may encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an &#39;undetermined&#39;,&quot; she explained.
We fear this favors intervention.
We think it would be better to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we don&#39;t yet know how the law will play out, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.&quot;
&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,&quot; she explained.
The German law is about assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force young children into at this point.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says German law &quot;empowers&quot; both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz&#39;s daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called Complete Androgen Resistance.
Because of the testosterone receptor defect in target cells, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff member in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
&quot;The law gives parents leeway so they don&#39;t have to rush into making decisions,&quot; Baratz said.
It buys them time to take various tests and sort things out, giving them time before writing &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female.&quot;
That way everything is fine - you raise the child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of being a parent.
And you don&#39;t have to rush into an operation that can&#39;t be undone.
&quot;It includes the kids in the decision-making process and takes away the fear that parents have because they don&#39;t think they&#39;re doing the right thing,&quot; she said.
Ultimately, the child decides which gender suits them better, and that&#39;s wonderful.
This enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Mastered the fight excellently
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway&#39;s novel &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, is tailor-made for Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hand in his profession, the art of acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago when it comes to fishing.
The two just complement each other perfectly.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles on the old man&#39;s neck that the fisher boy Manolo is talking about.
When Santiago sits hunched over his chair, tired from life, it&#39;s real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a character role through and through, which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is largely the sole actor on stage.
He manages to focus the audience&#39;s attention on himself, so his monologues are never boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea is all water bottles lit up in blue after all.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings about the Cuban way of life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba&#39;s rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Fancy some glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis harnessed the fluorescent properties of sea creatures and turned them into a glowing treat.
He got the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to synthesize the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in your mouth and glows - so the more you lick it, the lighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company Lick Me I&#39;m Delicious, says, &quot;The product is amazing, but it&#39;s still very early in production, so you can get two grams for £200.&quot;
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
As the mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice cream glows.
We&#39;ve been testing it for the past few months and we felt it would be ideal to launch on Halloween because it has this wonderful glow effect.
It&#39;s probably the most expensive ice cream I&#39;ve ever made, as the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie&#39;s experimental Bristol-based company is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation should be even more ambitious.
He says, &quot;I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot;
This is inherently impossible due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I guess we&#39;ll find a way to make it work.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially created by Chinese scientists
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, will deal with the topic &quot;To hell with hell - theological reflections on how to deal with the last things today&quot;.
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, Salem Castle and the Lake Constance Cultural Office.
In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to pursue the question of how people today classify the &quot;last things&quot; after death.
If people had known too much about this in the past centuries and had relied on those images of heaven and hell &quot;that shape our ideas to this day&quot;, then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes for completion is characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness out.
&quot;The greater hope has been driven out of Christians by the criticism of religion,&quot; says the speaker.
She &quot;provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks&quot;.
Johanna Rahner continues: &quot;But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death&quot;.
This is linked to the question of that longing &quot;that dreams of everything being good in the end&quot;.
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her PhD in 1997. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: The fair answers wedding questions
&quot;Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery man can undertake,&quot; said the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.
A special fair in the domain in Hechingen gave tips on how at least the wedding celebration should be successful.
Important suppliers around a wedding were represented.
A trend: the retro look is back.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is a must, preferably muted or cream.
The often ruffled and embroidered dresses are closed at the front, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end in a train.
However, opinions differ, as emphasized by Stefanie Koch from theclothing mill fashion house.
For men, the suit with waistcoat and plastron dominates, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The selection of the restaurant is important, it was explained.
Unadorned adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain draws attention to its own offer in the depot.
If you then want to drive up in a carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
&quot;Carriages are also popular for hen parties,&quot; he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The &quot;after-wedding photo&quot; is becoming more and more fashionable - that is, a series of shots in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many other details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits Thursday against handset makers, including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel&#39;s bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel&#39;s patents for $4.5 billion, is suing Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, hitting the heart of Google&#39;s search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running Google&#39;s Android operating system, which faces fierce competition from Apple&#39;s and Microsoft&#39;s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million bid for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its bid several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After being outbid by Rockstar on Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal also motivated in part by Motorola&#39;s library of patents.
&quot;Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in suit at the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents,&quot; the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking hefty damages from Google as it claims Google&#39;s patent infringement was intentional, the allegation says.
Frankfurt parking fees are set to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become significantly more expensive.
This morning, the city magistrate is discussing a proposal from the head of the traffic department, Stefan Majer (Greens).
Accordingly, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the prices should not be raised for this, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
The City Council still has to make a decision in December.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this &quot;not a good idea&quot;.
The parking space directly in front of the shop is &quot;an advantage for smaller specialist dealers that should not be underestimated&quot;.
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is &quot;quite appropriate and actually long overdue&quot;.
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Oil prices continue to fall to $96 a barrel
Oil prices fell further on Friday after concerns over high supply overshadowed a report showing China&#39;s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The benchmark crude for December deliveries was down 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange late this morning in Europe.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, meaning the price fell 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy said Wednesday US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there were signs of stronger demand with two reports of picking up activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery in China&#39;s economy, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after hitting a two-decade low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by US refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
The throwaway society doesn&#39;t think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point we have to go home.
Only: Hunger is noticeable in the bellies of the people in the front passenger and back seats.
Sure, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more chilled than driving to the nearest drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit that I like to be there when it comes to getting fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then off to bed and home!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become apparent.
Because what&#39;s missing that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Discarded paper bags lie on the roadside and in parking lots, especially at weekends.
&quot;Why?&quot; I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next garbage can?
It&#39;s not just that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Bags have also covered traffic facilities such as crash barriers, causing accidents.
But the said &quot;throwaway society&quot; doesn&#39;t think about something like that, they probably don&#39;t even know what this word actually means.
If you are often out and about in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a night of partying: clothes, bottles and other rubbish pile up there.
A few more bags wouldn&#39;t make any difference - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to trample on the leftovers of others.
I can already see the day coming when the cities and communities will get bored with clearing away - and the fast food chains will have to charge a deposit for their bags.
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
For example, pureed tofu with vegetable cream is a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Association names more for World Vegan Day on November 1st.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1st, the Vegetarian Association of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, and yoghurt can be replaced with soy yoghurt.
Soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used instead of milk.
Whipped vegetable cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
Half a mashed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
You can also use 50 grams of applesauce or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water.
Instead of using egg, you can loosen dough with a mixture of one teaspoon of baking powder, one tablespoon of cornflour and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silken tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the deteriorating highway system and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits on the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning bureaus to overhaul the outdated system of funding US roads.
The normally rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are arguing that the government should be able to use the small boxes to record miles driven - and possibly where driven - and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has raised a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress can&#39;t agree on a course of action, several states aren&#39;t waiting any longer.
They are currently studying how they can move to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
&quot;It&#39;s not something that we will possibly use,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record mileage for all California drivers in the state by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes Americans pay at the gas pump, is broke.
But in America people don&#39;t fill up as much as they used to.
Cars use less petrol.
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) has not increased in 20 years.
When fuel prices are high, politicians don&#39;t dare raise the tax by even one cent.
&quot;The gas tax just isn&#39;t sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transportation law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently fitted 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
&quot;It represents the most sensible long-term alternative,&quot; he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
Unsurprisingly, the idea has found favor with urban liberals, as the tax could be used to influence driving behavior to reduce congestion and climate-damaging emissions, for example.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to meet the state&#39;s ambitious statutory climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The independent marketers at the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of having drivers pay based on the distance they have traveled.
&quot;This isn&#39;t a black hole tax,&quot; explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former US Secretary of Transportation, who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The US Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But a majority in the House of Representatives blocked the move, responding to concerns from rural lawmakers who represent people who often have to travel long distances to get to work or into town on a daily basis.
Several states and major cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the country&#39;s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon be paying the mileage fee to the state instead of the fuel tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently fitted with the devices, drivers were wary of the government tracking their every move.
&quot;Big Brother concerns and things like that were a big issue,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn&#39;t want it.
As the test began, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website, &quot;It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices.&quot;
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on individuals&#39; daily movements.
Nevada is among a number of states that are now looking to affordable technology that would allow the state to track mileage, but not exactly when and where.
With that, according to Khan, the public would also be more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup in California called True Mileage.
The company didn&#39;t originally start out to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for auto insurance that requires drivers to pay based on miles driven.
However, the devices she tested are also of interest to road planners because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
&quot;People are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations aren&#39;t recorded,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Big mistakes were made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a variety of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose not to use any device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents in the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by adding more features to the devices rather than fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that will also pay for parking, pay for mileage-only insurance, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles to help drivers avoid traffic jams.
&quot;Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,&quot; according to a city planning document.
Some transportation planners, however, are wondering if all the talk about paying per mile is just a huge red herring.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid or other fuel-efficient vehicles so that they too pay their fair share.
&quot;There&#39;s no need for surgery when an aspirin will do,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the commission&#39;s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field lost none of its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had probably wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Petrus didn&#39;t want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or couldn&#39;t hold one for some reason were left behind.
The musicians who framed the ceremony felt the same way as did many a speaker.
That&#39;s why FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, got wet.
Above all, he thanks Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the club members who got involved.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The energetic pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, member of the Landtag, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the southern Baden football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club, also spoke welcoming speeches for the municipal sports committee.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that the recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn damaged the original lawn so much that it could not be played on.
The first thoughts about solving the problem were already 15 years ago, when the idea of building a third pitch at the football club site or at the Realschule am Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about creating an artificial turf pitch, which was widely considered to be the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning began two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube on a long-term lease, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the pitch and the state approved subsidies of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros of the total costs of 560,000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
Construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf field began on June 4th.
During the construction phase, which lasted more than three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used to create a dirt bike track.
Unknowns injure girl by shot from car
Unknowns injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shots were fired from a car.
The perpetrators presumably fired an airgun at a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening.
This was announced by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Paramedics took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A pane broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police determined, it said on Friday.
Snowden ready to &#39;cooperate&#39; with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US Secret Service&#39;s whistleblower, has said he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, do not provide any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: &quot;Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and tries to criminalize political expression with the threat of punishment , where no defense is possible.&quot;
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he believes the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, then we will find ways to make that possible.&quot;
US-German relations have been strained by allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s cellphone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary intelligence committee, said the opportunity should be taken to hear Snowden as a witness if possible &quot;without endangering him and completely wrecking relations with the US&quot;.
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that if Snowden leaves the country, according to former NSA employee Snowden&#39;s lawyer, he cannot return to Russia.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs assurances that he is &quot;safe&quot; there, the MP said.
Snowden says in his letter that he faces a &quot;serious and ongoing&quot; campaign of persecution that has driven him from his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to &quot;my act of political expression&quot;.
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians - including in the United States - have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of extensive surveillance a &quot;community merit&quot;.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities cooperation &quot;once the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved.&quot;
Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique&#39;s founder and first President, to sing calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
&quot;We want peace again, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the country&#39;s future, she swapped her business attire for a T-shirt that read &quot;We Demand Security&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital&#39;s Independence Square on Thursday.
For the last two weeks there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo on an almost daily basis, in what are considered among the worst skirmishes since the peace agreement was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement backed initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa&#39;s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country&#39;s independent government.
It became an opposition party after the 1992 peace treaty.
Analysts say the country is unlikely to slip back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals alike.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of vast offshore gas deposits and coal deposits in the Northwest could see investments in excess of $50 billion over the next few years from the likes of Rio Tinto, Brazil&#39;s Vale, Italy&#39;s Eni and Bringing Anadarko into the country from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group&#39;s leader, Renamo&#39;s spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wants &quot;to use all his remaining strength to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government&quot;.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
&quot;Our vision is to resume negotiations and do it in earnest,&quot; Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to settle tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
&quot;We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) butting heads,&quot; says Joseph Hanlon, a senior lecturer at the Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott November&#39;s municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to secure concessions and financial favors from the government.
Renamo&#39;s electoral record has dwindled since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to do better in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza - whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country&#39;s democracy.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want multi-party democracy, he doesn&#39;t want transparent elections, he doesn&#39;t want peace because he doesn&#39;t want to give up the presidency,&quot; Mazanga said.
It&#39;s unclear what Renamo&#39;s capabilities are, but they have launched disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south route.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo but is home to Beira, the port used by mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga was reticent when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,&quot; Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people were already concerned about corruption, slow development progress and a recent wave of kidnappings.
&quot;People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,&quot; he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just want stability.
&quot;No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,&quot; he explained.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years came to life in the &quot;Freihof&quot;.
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene play.
Screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk designed an entertaining play from the moment of arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, which received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience with him as speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged leaps in time from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his childhood heaven, to his Freihof.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his prime role as the city&#39;s big boy.
True to style, he drove up with the pair and &quot;Black Forest Foxes&quot; owned by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with great applause from the audience, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well how to put himself in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbach peasant band played suitably selected pieces of music, rounding off the performance.
Haslach&#39;s Mayor Heinz Winkler, who represented the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council, paid his respects to the awarding of honorary citizenship.
The singers of the Epiphany then paid their respects, prompting Hansjakob to exclaim: &quot;Oh, how nice, my youthful memories of my own Epiphany are coming alive again&quot;.
With their song &quot;O Jesulein&quot; they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Stork Day children with their loud &quot;Out, out&quot;.
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
He found his resting place in his homeland, behind his burial chapel on the Brand near Hofstetten.
&quot;A restless spirit had finally found peace and gone home forever,&quot; it said at the end of the play.
There was much applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Chinese newspaper to be &quot;reformed&quot; after call
A Chinese newspaper that had a front-page call for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express ran a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted bribes to fabricate reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a &quot;comprehensive rectification,&quot; the regulatory authority said.
The &quot;rectification order&quot; was issued by the Guangdong Bureau of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inaccurate reports about the public company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
&quot;The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly,&quot; the regulator said in a statement.
She said the decision was made to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter&#39;s license.&quot;
It also &quot;ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant people in the New Express be identified and the New Express leadership team reviewed immediately.&quot;
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper ran two front-page calls for his release and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he was paid to publish false reports.
&quot;In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to earn the trust of the public,&quot; he told state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and fame.
I realized that I did wrong.
Following Chen&#39;s apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizen policies and its own public utility company, no second mayoral candidate has yet come forward.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline is Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Holy Communion comes into focus
As the city&#39;s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city&#39;s culture and tourism office is dedicating the last of this year&#39;s public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Church of the Holy Communion.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, Haigerloch&#39;s time after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule, should be looked at.
The crowning glory is a visit to the Church of the Holy Communion.
There, the tour participants are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also catches a glimpse of the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the one and a half hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkellermuseum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
Speaking to Australian radio this week, the pop star said she worked as a backing vocalist on Jagger&#39;s 2004 song &quot;Old Habits Die Hard.&quot;
Perry explained that she had dinner with the veteran rocker and that &quot;he hit on me when I was 18.&quot;
She added, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time and he&#39;s been very nice to me.&quot;
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he &quot;categorically denies that he has ever made advances to Katy Perry.&quot;
The rep added, &quot;Maybe she mistook him for someone else.&quot;
Perry was one of the singers who guest-starred on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism went straight to #1 this week.
NSA says an &quot;internal error&quot; and not hackers are to blame for the site crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday a bug shut down its public website for several hours, not hackers as claimed online.
&quot;NSA.gov was down for several hours last night due to an internal error during a scheduled update,&quot; the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and some users are still not.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency&#39;s sensitive internal network was &quot;in no way&quot; compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have taken down the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the target system&#39;s internal network.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has now found itself in the limelight and has faced harsh criticism at home and abroad following revelations over the past few months about its extensive surveillance program - a result of classified NSA data stolen and released by disaffected former NSA operative Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency fueled initial speculation that today&#39;s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spy affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
The Interfax agency reported this, citing unspecified circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified between states, it said.
It is practically impossible for Snowden to leave Russia.
&quot;In that case, he loses his refugee status,&quot; the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden is threatened with extradition there, it said
Children should be taught myths and legends as &quot;models for life,&quot; says one author.
The stories of Thor show that &quot;brutal strength stands no chance against clever tricks,&quot; and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are &quot;far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,&quot; so Crossley-Holland advocated &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate works.
&quot;I think it&#39;s wonderful that in America, myth and folklore are already part of education,&quot; he said.
I&#39;ve been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that children &quot;turn off completely&quot; with writers and teachers who are &quot;overly didactic&quot; because entertaining stories convey messages &quot;subliminally.&quot;
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, explained: &quot;You can have intentions, but try to keep them in the background.&quot;
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to instill hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy endings, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed through the story and not explained.
That&#39;s the old story of showing instead of telling.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet?
Flight Center seems to be bucking the trend.
The company has raised its full-year earnings outlook and expects record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous guidance.
If current targets are met, that would mean growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record earnings of $290.4 million in 2011-12.
According to managing director Graham Turner, Flight Center posted an 8% profit for the first half and had a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australia and the UK private business.
&quot;Year to date, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are on track to record annual earnings before interest and taxes,&quot; he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Flight Center&#39;s leisure business in the UK fared similarly well, while business customers also spent less here.
The US business rebounded from a seasonally weaker first half, leading to a full-year profit expected for the third straight year.
Flight Center shares rose 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Falkenberger discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; has begun.
Today&#39;s Friday evening is &quot;Pump this party&quot;, tomorrow&#39;s Saturday evening we&#39;ll continue with an over 25 party.
Of course, the organizers promise fat beats and cool sounds on both days.
Post hardly empties on Sundays anymore
&quot;Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes in the city center and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow Post AG containers, you quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and public holidays no longer takes place,&quot; said the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, the only emptying is in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Strasse 36 and Jakob-Müller-Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld.
The response to the FDP&#39;s request does not answer whether Hofheim and Rosengarten are still emptied on Sundays.
The social and youth policy spokesman for the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to follow up on this.
Sunday collection is an important postal service, especially for scheduled mail.
&quot;Despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, this company is radically and unreasonably thinning out&quot;.
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals parliamentary group and city association, supports his fellow parliamentarians: &quot;What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are being secretly changed or even canceled.&quot;
The post office is miles away from being close to the citizens.
&quot;At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied on Sundays,&quot; said Bittner and Rohrenbeck in unison.
The same applies to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens must be able to walk to a mailbox that is emptied on Sundays.
Rohrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
As far as he knows, there is also a Sunday collection in Hofheim.
Your party spoke out in favor of privatization.
&quot;Then decisions are made elsewhere,&quot; said Maier.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
However, in an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his split from his wife, supermodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said &quot;life sometimes doesn&#39;t go exactly as we plan or hope.&quot;
Kerr and he still love each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
&quot;We will support and love each other as parents to Flynn.&quot;
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Haslach: Skepticism is increasingly giving way to confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, there will be fundamental changes in the pastoral care unit in Haslach (SE).
There will then only be one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because nothing can be changed about the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new is slowly but surely giving way to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-time officials of the pastoral care team ranged from the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals for the future composition and size of the parish council.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt used a presentation to explain the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the archdiocese of Freiburg.
According to this, the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a corporation under public law, which will take over the rights and duties of the six individual parishes up to now.
There will only be one common parish council and one foundation council, in which the pastor Kraft Amtes is represented.
At least two elected members should be represented from each parish. So-called community teams are formed locally in the six parishes.
In the future, your task will be to promote church life in the village.
When it came to the question of the finances of the individual parishes, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for accumulated credits in the parishes to remain earmarked.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
There were great concerns, especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which will then affect all parishes.
&quot;Even in the past, investments were only made in projects that the individual parishes could manage on their own,&quot; put Haslach&#39;s parish council chairman, Bruno Prinzbach, into perspective.
Barbar Ritter, chairperson of the committee in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
In 2006 they set themselves the task of &quot;becoming one, staying five&quot; and had to realize that it wasn&#39;t that easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit then set about answering the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The elaborations will be specified in further meetings and decided in another joint meeting of all six committees next spring.
At the end, parish councilor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved with a clear majority.
Tax on foreign property owners against London&#39;s speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure but is awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 Budget imposed a 7% stamp duty on homes costing over £2million and annual fees for buyers, hold the apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, stamp duty receipts from the Boroughs of Westminster and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, which totaled £708m in tax year 2012/13, exceed receipts for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber Region together.
Cook said: &quot;Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of associated anti-evasion legislation, it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are undertaxed, notwithstanding the impact of the outdated council tax system.&quot;
&quot;But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London or deter owners from selling,&quot; he added.
Prime property - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in London&#39;s affluent South West Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% in the last year.
Central London prices showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging &#39;domestic&#39; market, comprising the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5 %) experienced an upward trend, according to research by Savills.
Even if SG Achim/Baden hasn&#39;t won for four matchdays, the upper league handball team is still in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
&quot;Because I don&#39;t even know what a win like that tastes like anymore,&quot; Malmon expects a sense of achievement from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third division reserve from Fredenbeck hasn&#39;t uprooted any trees yet, Malmon is raising his index finger in advance.
I coached many players myself when I was a junior.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
&quot;It is also important to wait and see whether there will be reinforcements from the first team,&quot; explains the SG coach.
In order to finally get back on the road to success, the Malmon team definitely needs to step up compared to past performances.
Above all, in the cover work and in the switching game, there was a huge problem in the end.
The exploitation of chances definitely needs to improve as well.
So I hope that my players have finally cleared their minds during the short break.
US plans to continue prosecuting Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of having passed on secret information without permission.
Therefore, he must face criminal proceedings in the United States, said US State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden&#39;s recent statements would not change that.
The German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously appealed to the USA after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbele&#39;s statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama&#39;s closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann&#39;s long-awaited work on the 2012 campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times, which has a copy of the forthcoming book, reported Thursday night that the president&#39;s top advisers conducted &quot;extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011&quot; to determine whether Obama&#39;s dwindling re-election hope would be better off if he ousted Biden let
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly chronicles the efforts of senior campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it is having on the poll numbers that swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for Vice President.
The potential move was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen of the president&#39;s closest aides -- including Daley, former Obama campaign director Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew about the proposed move.
Double Down alleges that Daley spearheaded efforts to swap out Biden despite their &quot;close, personal relationship&quot; before finally deciding against such a move after data showed Clinton&#39;s candidacy &quot;did the odds Obama&#39;s would not significantly improve&quot;.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
&quot;I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the President had terrible poll ratings at the time, so we were like, &quot;For God&#39;s sake, what are we going to do?&quot;
While Daley called the investigation &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort was expended during the reelection campaign to determine whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
&quot;Campaigns don&#39;t spend as much money on surveys and focus groups unless you&#39;re really thinking about something,&quot; explained Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the potential move.
Although Daley said he didn&#39;t think the president &quot;was aware&quot; of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted it was &quot;possible&quot; Obama could have known about it.
Martin added that &quot;Double Down&quot; does not provide a definitive answer as to whether the policy probings reached Obama&#39;s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
&quot;Possibly,&quot; Martin replied.
City council happy with solid budget
Mayor Ralph Gerster always has a good laugh when it comes to the budget at municipal council meetings.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not had any debts since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be viewed as a complete success.
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was more than EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, is also around one million euros above the estimate.
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax revenue and the municipality&#39;s share of income tax.
The capital budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
&quot;This is essentially due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget,&quot; says Rothmund.
Since fewer investments than planned were made in the 2012 financial year, the allocation to reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
&quot;You don&#39;t just shake a work like that out of your sleeve,&quot; praised Gerster, looking at the annual accounts.
He and the local councilors were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to do without high assessment rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, grants from the state have often been reduced.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various compensation funds.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must show certain assessment rates.
&quot;We have to look at the subject of multipliers, as there are investments in the coming years for which we would like grants,&quot; announced Gerster in this context.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their faith at confirmation
101 15- and 16-year-old youths from the Am Kleinen Heuberg pastoral care unit were confirmed in two services.
The group Laudato-Si accompanied the service in the morning and the youth choir The Spirit in the afternoon.
With the reception of the sacrament of confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past few months, the confirmands had prepared for the big feast day under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Untermachtal together.
Desperate cry from an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change was possible
He says Obama made a commendable effort that was thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy doesn&#39;t excuse Obamacare&#39;s website problems, the drone strikes
Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It&#39;s a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope during my dreary sophomore year in med school.
It&#39;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and chronicles Barack Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential election memoir.
When I finish my patient notes at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election was a landslide victory and news anchors paused to reflect on the historic significance of the hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was poised for change.
When Obama took office back in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a rude awakening, like being jerked out of a dream.
Those optimistic times are hard to remember - they seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has indeed changed.
But it&#39;s just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multifaceted things Obama has accomplished, from passing the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military pullout from Iraq, ending the army&#39;s forced silence on homosexuality, and killing Osama bin Laden.
I agree that partisan deadlock tactics have overturned too many aspirations designed to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts at explanations.
I&#39;ve reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why they allow foreign heads of state to be wiretapped or drones to kill innocent children overseas.
It fails to explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans&#39; private lives and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was assassinated without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the findings of a report that said the White House&#39;s efforts to silence the media were &quot;the most aggressive...since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what I should have expected.
Should I have understood when I was 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, MP is not a predictable course, with an opposition party and fortuitous events like the Newtown massacre dominating the public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely self-elected.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012 not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, seemingly unable to determine his direction and positions.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had been hearing about for so long.
But with Obama&#39;s approval ratings falling below 45% this week, this book has made the return to 2008 all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama suffered a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with campaign officials after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
&quot;I want us to find our magic again,&quot; he said.
We must remember who we are.
It&#39;s five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
Constance: closure after an accident at the Schänzle roundabout
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustrasse on Thursday evening around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was in the left turn lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstrasse and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old from Konstanz who was driving there.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 property damage was caused, the police said.
The roadway had to be closed while the accident was being recorded, it said.
Electricity is becoming more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the public utility company, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four in Pfullendorf faces additional costs of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is reassessed every year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These quantify the additional costs they incur as a result of the energy transition, which they can levy through a surcharge on the electricity price.
Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher surcharge in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the public utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
&quot;We are assuming an increase of 1 cent plus x,&quot; said Bias, although the number would be closer to 2 cents.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing down the troubles of his childhood and youth.
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the penchant for brute force and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner prizewinner is best known as a prose author; theater texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher has therefore put together a collage of prose texts for his performance &quot;Wetterglühen auf der Tonungspitze&quot;, which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz.
For example, the theater maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel &quot;The Serf&quot; (1987) with prose miniatures from &quot;Leichnam, Belauernd seine Familie&quot; (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa on which there are hints of copulating and masturbating - the eight-strong ensemble shimmy through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the template with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses in particular get their turn in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are grabbed hard, their heads are submerged under water, their evening robes are stapled to the wall.
Squeezed into cellophane or bodices, they stride through the production on dangerously high heels, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly conveyed in this strained way.
The evening has the best moments when there is singing - the spectrum ranges from deep purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the over-the-top performance calm down a bit, and Winkler&#39;s downright absurd humor flashes.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of remaining in the league for the relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Riesen.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project will not apply for a possible replacement spot.
&quot;We will not participate in the wildcard process,&quot; said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first relief could not be heard from Ludwigsburg.
&quot;We did not deal with the wildcard procedure as long as it is not certain that Düsseldorf will not receive a license,&quot; Neckar-Riesen boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Up until May 23, Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, the Rhinelanders have been refused the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the final instance.
