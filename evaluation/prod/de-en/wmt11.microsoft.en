What should it do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "pastry shop".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has "tapped" members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little how they master the notorious slang that has become established in recent years, when today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Prague's political elite in the bygone era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark about these new terms.
At least that's what they claim.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, reacted to the test of the "godfather vocabulary".
But councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"That is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use from time to time."
"Other than that, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by Tageblatt Aktuálně.cz in June before the ODS election congress, the editors picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists and Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised to take part in the conversation, but then did not even pick up the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and I don't judge how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other."
"What is important to me is how we understand each other in the context of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not recognize in the above-mentioned headline that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, was mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will probably have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by matador Karel Březina, but also by environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý as Tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant," Plachý is quite close to the solution to the riddle, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts that he drew this knowledge more from the newspaper than that this vocabulary was peculiar to him.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be any similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously we really don't have anything like that."
"We call each other by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says Petr Hulínský, chairman of the Prague ČSSD - casually called "Hulda" by his party colleagues.
"At school I was called Bříza (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us about his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades the "grandpa" or less friendly the "old man", the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention before the elections by machinations in party sponsoring, is called "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in intra-party parlance.
Hulínský allegedly does not like being called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Club Rights" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský earned his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually share some common social characteristics.
They tend to belong to the older generation, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, because they help with the work and give birth to children," says a nun, describing the situation that cares for more than one hundred women who have been outcast by their communities in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he published a brochure intended to prevent the "witch hunt".
But there's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out the dilemma of written education.
Being accused of witchcraft is also common practice in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men who doused her with kerosene and simply set her on fire.
This incident was also reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
This was after the group tried to "exorcise an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by the people here regardless of their education.
"Der Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human souls are a danger in the past as well as today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch-hunt, the Gambian president himself got involved last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly participated in her deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguards, forcibly abducted arrested women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink a decoction of plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive their stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly one thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the stove - but still pays higher rent
An elderly stocky man is leaving the RPG Byty client centre of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm is a folder with three new leases for three apartments: for his own apartments and those of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just had their rent increased as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent, the son is to shell out 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he angrily taps his finger on the new lease of the son, which he has a power of attorney to sign.
"But what - I signed," he explains, half upset and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it plans to publish instructions on how to take action against such contracts.
But the man just waves it off.
"One says this, the other that," he makes a grim face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid rent in line with the market.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already packed at nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device.
"Rent 2011" is how a special touch panel lights up on the touch screen.
Briefly tapped and the device spits out a number note.
As soon as we have deciphered the number "157" and it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes with the new leases will flutter into the mailboxes of most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in RPG's portfolio in the Ostrava region.
In the letters, RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rents in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs for a little over a week, which means it's just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter answer after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, Lubomír Zaorálek, Vice-President of the ČSSD from Ostrava, had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even ne besch. They could change toilet goggles," says the man mentioned at the beginning.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners in particular are queuing up at the counter to see for themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer on time.
Other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were here for rent in 2011," estimate the counter clerks.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as blackboards where it seems necessary.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not meant to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG explains on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, 5,000 of which I have left for food, where should I get the money for a court case," he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she points out.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund, criticized by the angry tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase, according to the homeowners.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rents collected between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is said to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red glowing information appears again and again.
"The rent increases in 2011 of 15% or less affect 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"This always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," reads the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it's about increasing extremely low rents of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not skyrocket rents, but will happen gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation on itself: All income from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - primarily these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The Arch.Design design and architectural studio, from whose studios a whole series of renowned Brno buildings originate, counted on the premises for its company mini-kindergarten from the first drafts for the new Avriopoint building.
With wise foresight, because most of its 90 employees are of baby boom age and the company wants the designers and architects to return to work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shorter hours, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for civil engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding profession and child welfare.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and qualified personnel and operation have been provided for a period of 2 years.
After exhausting the funds (2 years), the company is Arch.Design obliged to continue operating the mini-kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of the application.
The children are taken care of all day by qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but several children alternate throughout the day.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tailored to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, but they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, eliminating the stress of late picking up the children from a distant kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus joined the ranks of Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out Gaudi's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants nicknamed the house with its organic shapes "bone house".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living beings.
Only on closer inspection do you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole façade looks even more three-dimensional, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and strips.
The Batlló house in the Eixample district, on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was created by the conversion of a house from 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one, but in the end he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló tenement house was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner were created and the use of mosaics on the façade was also his idea.
However, numerous other sculptors and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in Park Güell, which also contains other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "bone house" by the local inhabitants because of its organic forms.
Others called it the "yawning house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique for the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination already seems a bit bizarre.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all building regulations of the time and was by no means deterred by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified by the result two years later when it was completed that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors were also offended by the fact that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, only fifteen days after the neighbourhood's request to do so, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for connecting spaces with each other.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger company could chat comfortably without having to forego a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudí's renovation also gave the house a rather unusual roof and two more floors.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the atriums.
The play of these two colours gives all floors of the house maximum light.
In doing so, he simply made use of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is opened to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was discovered that this was a fairly lucrative business, the visits were maintained, and they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the monument is not a cardboard handle, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, you should try to make friends with one of the inhabitants of the house and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed frame? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and grate make the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, height, state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which the mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Case in point?
In a weekend house that does not heat regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited because they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting tubules in the core and lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: It is therefore not excluded that mold forms under them.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the choice.
Anyone who has been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"I think all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep properly here anymore."
"For their battered shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of viscous foam (memory foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"Among other things, I recommend these to diabetics who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can hardly receive the 'information' from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why years ago I bought many ice hockey players, but also other customers, these mattresses with viscous foam (memory foam).
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of viscous foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally nestles against the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against bedsores (gangrene).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are about 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly bent arms," advises Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and also presents this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grates at different heights and this is by no means possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the mold layer and the fine padding.
"You must not feel the feathers with your hand or when sitting down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of grate.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and pad like grown together Siamese twins have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common practice today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is another reason why experts reject advertising slogans that promise mattresses a lifespan of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is advisable to use a mattress protector that can be easily peeled off and washed.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with a wrap-around zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often seems like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a grid?
Out with it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, you should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a surface.
For non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring strips (slats), latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), always pay off gratings with a larger number of slats, ie of 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar support and the possibility to regulate the slatted hardness.
Mattresses with a spring skeleton do not belong on adjustable slat frames, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press in the spring strips or even to angle them so that they allow the punctual sinking of the sleeper's shoulder.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
Also the ladies are thought of - they are granted these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or gratings with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion seems ideal, as the Scandinavians like it, for example.
In the lateral position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (hay-filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
The new magic word for mattresses is also "organic".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly being used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, castor oil and soybean oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic in mattresses means that their core consists of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here, too, a distinction is made between men and women.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract of birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb heat and cool the body, the covers for women have a "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortably warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and viscous foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to shell out 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT because they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to receive this advantage.
As you can see, saving on the mattress and the grate is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with quilted viscous foam Memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one is free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, as they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also generally increases sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief for the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently with the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been terrified by the case of the missing Anička and so they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Even at the price of an invasion of their privacy.
"We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there can be misuse of such devices, for example if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things when they don't want to be controlled."
"Initially, the mobile phones aroused great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate him."
"Today it's the mobile phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would seek them out as well, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she acknowledges that similar devices can be helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is integrated, which means that if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also be performed by intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller cell phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are currently being tested.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he only notices it after a certain time, which gives the police a head start," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards wristbands or pendants, the same technology is always used as for vehicle tracking.
In other words, the combination of the location function using the GPS system (just like the navigation system in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic But they only last two years.
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of fuses, with explosives to be detonated.
The year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of fuses to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the fuses from the joint-stock company STV Group, a. s. for a paltry 40 million crowns.
In its justification for purchasing this enormous amount of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume about 60 kilometers of fuses annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, whom MF DNES approached, this statement shows that the entire army would have to undergo extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning ladies.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not exempt.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of fuses.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
If, however, the old rule of experts still applies that two meters of fuse are sufficient for the training of every new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased demand of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so that shooting exercises are severely limited due to the lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I also can't think of why they buy so many fuses from us."
But that's ultimately their decision, they'll know what they need them for."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to accommodate as much as possible," says Jan Děcký, Sales Manager of STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fuses by saying that the army had stocked up on this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of fuses and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
At the end of its useful life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of fuse.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: The annual consumption of fuses by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet fraternal army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police only ever order such quantities of this ammunition as they can consume before the end of their useful life.
Already because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, one keeps open the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable fuses.
The Ministry of Defense already has huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians mentioned by MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces will face the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses that they have bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day, the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition come in handy.
The winning placement in the "Small Business of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's Small Business of the Year competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that Liberec lacked good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester university student at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all his profits in the house, which he then gradually converted into a guesthouse with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec.
Until recently, the most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
"A large part of this license sale for operating hotels was the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory has brought him greater notoriety, even popularity, in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that felt really good," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win right away, every visibility is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
"I still have regular business relationships with some of the people I met thanks to the competition."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also reflected a little on each of his employees.
And there he has about seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is universally recognized."
I really don't see this as just a personal success, no, it's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has just come to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Karel Žďárský, the owner of Farmet, received the award for first place in last year's Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
At that time, the jury praised the efforts with which he turned the small tool shop in Česká Skalice into a company that generates hundreds of millions in sales.
"I can say that this recognition has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against the competition," says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, abandoned his career in the company where he had been employed until then and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through its success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only did our customers become much more aware of the Farmet brand, but our foreign partners also began to attach greater importance to being able to work with a company that had achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
For Farmet, however, the past year was not only marked by victory euphoria.
The appraisal was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of it in 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at that time shook not so much the citizens but mainly the companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and limit the purchase of new equipment and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation either."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to cut production and even resort to layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
There was one thing the company was unwilling to compromise on – investment in research and development.
"With the grant, we built a research and training center, we encouraged our presentation at international fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll that does away with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the business competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been eliminated.
The dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" was the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
This is how more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the civil servant could have retrieved it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the Commercial Register when carrying out inspections of social security payers," said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for ČSSZ.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to take a close look at all the regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneur competition organized by the Czech. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity among the public.
If last year about three thousand people took part in the vote, this year there were already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder the company's activities.
"As far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, for example, we occupy a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was announced for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the editorial deadline of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet on the websites.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year's opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening in which personalities from political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were present at the highlight of the competition.
"Where the state throws sticks between the legs of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today still make it unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs to do business," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to get rid of nonsensical arrangements are having an effect.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or funfair with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office business trips of employees of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on the so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things come in threes:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen, which required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two bathroom scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement was eliminated.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair ventures.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, which is the announcer and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and would provide enough material for an independent article.
Although they are diametrically opposed in the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about handicapped people, personal problems or the health of one's own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic was the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of an endowment fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it took third place within this region.
In the Olomouc region, the winner was the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which, among other things, introduced a fluid working time reduced to an average of 35 hours per week without a proportionate reduction in wages.
At the award ceremony, the jury also acknowledged the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimize the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, cares about the health of its employees and has therefore purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all its notebooks, promotes home work among its employees and uses cartering services offered by a sheltered local workshop for company events.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes extra bonuses to its employees' pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions for meals, commuting, improving their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered for the category Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer by August 15 at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but they were not disqualified in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition currently taking place for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the crime of fraud in a public competition," Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsen prosecutor's office, told the newspaper "Právo", adding that she could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
How he was able to manipulate public competition can only be speculated about in view of the scarce official information.
In response to Právo's question, Lubomír Černá's spokesperson for the Land Fund stated that the police had indeed made arrests in the Pilsen branch of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to Ms Černá, the public competition had the correct name 'invitation to tender for claims for the transfer of land under the Land Law' and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the request, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the value of the land proclaimed."
"According to the claims offered, the order of potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information at his disposal as to who had registered in response to the request and, since he himself was a entitled person, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance payment.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had very good contacts with the Pilsen Land Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he gave up land in substitute restitutions for which location decisions had already been made for construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund, for example, intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, on the site where the construction of the access road to the Borské pole industrial park was planned.
Later, he exchanged them very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the town hall had to give in with a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January, households will not only have to reckon with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and sewage charges and for district heating, and in some places rents are also rising.
From January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more out of their wallets each month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also become more expensive.
The increase in electricity alone costs households several hundred crowns more every year.
Heavy electricity prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic systems, is to blame.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but exactly when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Larger towns in particular are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 crowns more per month for district heating from January, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1,000 crowns more per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened with 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rent regulation will cease to apply from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase will be prosecuted by the company.
Regulated rents, which are still paid today in almost 300,000 apartments, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whiskey, which was stolen from the father's house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need emergency treatment.
No exception are children who have to sleep their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the reception of the children's wards of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department at the Hořovice Central Bohemian Clinic.
"Whisky, if you manage to steal a bottle from your father's bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it does not smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"Most often it's about Fernet or Rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Occasionally, it was also about Slibowitz, who you take from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission.
In front of the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Motol hospital, where ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"One girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, when she was admitted for the first time with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in her blood and in combination with 'ecstasy'," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," says the chief physician.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when toasting with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, real dependence in the true sense of the word is not about children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all the associated phenomena and this is not the case with these children."
Those who repeatedly consume alcohol usually have a negative family-social background," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Mrs. Jurinová, about forty drunken children had been admitted to the local Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, if applicable, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink such a bottle of liquor at school, Mr. Pelikán believes that there are three seasonal amplitudes that can be relied on one hundred percent: Walpurgis Night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad report card or out of joy for the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I have already experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording," emphasizes Doctor Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to deal with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches of the morning after, which result from dehydration and lack of glucose, can be dispelled in the hospital with a fluidizing infusion with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes at least spoiling the patient's good mood by telling them the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time I used this as a means of education, when I calculated directly to the children during the rounds what their drunkenness cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party," added Doctor Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they have so far only been seen at maneuvers or air shows.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159s.
These are currently still preserved in Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, does not yet know when it will physically dispatch the planes from Vodochody.
The single-seat L-159 fighter aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term stored aircraft without further deposits and investments on the part of the ministry.
"The two-seat L-159T1s were replaced in their current condition and appearance," Pejšek told Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter jets, as the Ministry of Defense signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the conversion of four superfluous L-159s to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second it wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforcing the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer for L-159 aircraft and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how to implement the item," Pejšek said.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not put out to tender for the purchase, but approached EADS directly.
The defense department at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 aircraft, of which it uses only 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission referred the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European invitation to tender and certainly not by approaching a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising finding of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty," explained study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men were equally likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, however, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which form already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research found that testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was vaguely aware of this study, but he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "fully proven" so far.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
On the streets and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter service workers were in many places all night on the road.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents involving trucks and cars and the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague is also "stationary".
This was Novinky.CZ said by the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometre 91 a truck crashed, at kilometre 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
Drivers should exit immediately after Brno at kilometre 190 or drive via Brno and start at kilometre 182 at Kývalka.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
An accident also happened on the D11 and that right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself, there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, motorcades form in the Prosek district, and the street Štěrboholská is also completely congested.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team meets.
There are also problems with the railways and at the airfield.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train connections due to snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should definitely inform themselves about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are passable only with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely impassable, in the vicinity of Brno snow drifts form in places and in the surroundings of Blansko it is forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will have to be used to clear snow.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be passable again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is advised in the territory of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for nature conservation reasons may only be strewn with inert grit, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimeters of fresh snow, most in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slowly stopping snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
American troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, previously known only by its code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of only a few meters to the target.
The special projectiles of caliber 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing high-explosive explosives, practically function like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous rain of steel splinters from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he aims at the target and emits a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact sighting point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to pull the trigger.
"Let's say they measured 543 m."
"When you pull the trigger, the gun charges and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs to be relocated
The Fujitsu Group relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt's Niederrad district, in July next year.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the group should be accommodated there, which are currently distributed in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in the Astro Park were better suited to the way the employees worked.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance, especially for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), head of the Frankfurt Department of Economic Affairs, said that a "global player" had once again been won.
This is a "great commitment to the location".
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management about the intention.
"We naturally offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Mariánské Lázně Square.
Ultimately, economic reasons were decisive.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent location.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
Ten years ago, the house on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" (Little Vertical), which Fujitsu had previously used, were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town, along with the other buildings on Marienbad Square.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was built between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously partly used as parking lots and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzern describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association has its headquarters.
Amazon blocks servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly under pressure.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It is possible that political pressure is behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The disclosure platform Wikileaks is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted lists, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks ousted from Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," said the disclosure activists via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic cables in order to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
Wikileaks tweeted: "Great, our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given Wikileaks' previous releases of classified information," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be denied the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, egregious and reckless actions put our national security at risk and endanger lives around the globe," the non-partisan senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company — whether American or foreign — should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, an exchange of blows broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently leaked spying calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website."
The US government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
As a special representative, the deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed, informed the White house.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after Wikileaks disclosed the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government shares and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
From gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere, on german somewhat old-fashioned ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The gelataio uses a spatula to take the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter, spread it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't ignore the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice cream machines established the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest number of visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture onto the slippery ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something of her own after years in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget the icing on the cake of the national and generally southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to production seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice creams.
The lecturer is immediately bombarded with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to your own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only made from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, but then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses, and the customer bites on all the ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to sell you dozens of flavored additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the course participants are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano has them each make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit ice cream varieties are subjected to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - that's not necessarily better in terms of taste.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a calculation task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winegrowers use it to measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make arithmetic easier.
Making ice cream doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small breakdowns are inevitable.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his classmates with fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
"In any course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa is infiltrated by the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This accusation is now being formulated by the Testbiotech expert group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of EFSA's expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
This is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper had worked significantly on the EFSA test regulations for GM plants and was thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The EFSA regulations are worded identically to Ilsi's position papers and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has encountered a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking EFSA manager recently went to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without conditions or transition period - and thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authority and the industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians pay attention.
However, EFSA cannot identify any conflict of interest.
One uses all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it says in a statement.
The experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contacts with industry.
However, they would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In fact, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding trial in animals and that the reaction of GM plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified maize does in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?" asks Then accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this field, as in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
As a rule, studies critical of companies are not published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of the Stuttgart train station, his tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators had moved in and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When construction stopped, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he sawed one open, it smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the chunks, he does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades in old stones.
He bought all the ones that were incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden booth that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, then it is the most sensible thing if the stones are reused.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the cuboids, which weigh an average of 80 kilos, at a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but some also in the hope of being able to give it back during reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owners, landscapers, home builders.
They came from everywhere and dragged away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of offense have long since been transformed into "walls" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets into his SUV and takes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then became interested in computers and finally became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40,000 tons of stones.
He gathers his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest scrap dealer in the republic.
He brakes.
Artfully hewn sandstones lie in the snow.
"They once belonged to Dresden's Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And further.
"Beautiful travertine."
The cuboids once belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be hewn by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
"It would be a scandal to shred something like that."
He has not become rich, certainly not stone-rich.
But the stone merchant employs 14 people today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a horticulturist have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the recycler.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Talent battle for high potentials
There is a lot of crowds at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to talk shop together with VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen along the way.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies are now going into hand-to-hand combat and, like VW, are relying on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls, before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists of the achievements of their students, they try to spot the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is courting the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the Group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is supervising the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who could be considered as an employee."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
What is new is that the students are being courted so offensively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for the newly graduated students will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
Rather, they have to advertise themselves and courtship highly qualified workers in particular.
Graduates from engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineering gap will become even larger.
Roman Dykta hunts for talent for the auditing and consulting firm KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
Incidentally, participants can take a look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to participate, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the guns are getting bigger and bigger when battling and stabbing for the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to work.
"We are still in contact with all participants in a similar campaign last year."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to direct courting on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular also go hunting at career fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"At Intersolar, for example," reports Sitha Stübe, Head of Human Resources at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young talent.
There are currently 35 vacancies advertised on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to fill vacant positions right now."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact via the university professors.
SolarWorld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not announced at the solar specialist.
The company tries to advertise itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often can't offer that," says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other decisive factors.
In a study by the Great Place to Work Institute, SolarWorld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
HR manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also earn plus points for job seekers.
"I think applicants are particularly looking for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within one's own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, then they would advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances all by themselves.
"It's like playing with a gang," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban – and thus finally revoked its earlier plans.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast will also remain prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster, which claimed the lives of eleven workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been conclusively clarified.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions in claims.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is to present its findings in the course of December.
In October, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which had fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist reassures journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to his chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
There is no sign that brown plumes of crude oil float beneath the surface.
She used to collect buckets of shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggishly flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, vast amounts of crude oil poured into the vast wetland from a burst pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black liquorice poles, sadly found palm trees let their fronds hang.
Flocks of birds, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are searched in vain: As soon as the outboard engine is silent, an eerie calm spreads in the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni has been a battlefield that has been contested for decades: Here the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance organized in the 80s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland lie fallow, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames rise out of the water like bizarre sculptures: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the boreholes far too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the core.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil that penetrated into the sea off Alaska during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed.
While the Shell group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
In 2008, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company of setting significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual elsewhere in the world: the rate of defects in the lines alone was "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are splinter naked and smeared with oil up to their necks.
A fire flickers under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to pipes, some scattered arbitrarily on the site: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later kerosene and finally diesel drip out at the end of the line.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters a day: "That brings us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
The delta inhabitants take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euro cents per liter can still be undercut by the illegal stoves: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkerers" who tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million liters of crude oil are lost every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny part of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share is filled into tankers by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officers, and sell it off on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni, especially with Shell, has been so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group would be possible: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese will turn out to be better."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular oilman.
"The soldiers can come any minute."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who mainly come from the north of the country, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defect in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major safety problem.
Investigators have discovered in the investigation of an emergency landed machine a possible construction defect, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency landing Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian aviation safety authority has found in its investigations a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, it was said in a statement published this Thursday by the authority ATSB.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Affected are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of grounds in an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had come loose and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce blamed an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
Following the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide now have to be replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they would carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Overnight, snow fell almost all over the country.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights are cancelled.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is frosting Germany: With icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowed in the night to Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but could not cope with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects storm surges on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, the snow drifts on the motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the severe weather center Meteomedia, purple alert was therefore announced in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Sometimes 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars got stuck there during the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue workers with blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations are already reported.
According to a Fraport spokeswoman, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 camp beds available for them.
On many roads, there were already accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was hit on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had overturned with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
But the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore stir up even with light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: The twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplaces.
But now the financial group wants to get the cost of the renovation apparently out again – and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always look at whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties themselves and then rent them back," he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution will relinquish its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had taken over the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then extensively renovated them.
The energetic conversion devoured the information according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have now been renamed "Greentowers", at around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is currently still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands mourn dead miners
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have commemorated the buried miners who were pronounced dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft remains precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue workers could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the miners could be seen.
Pictures and personal belongings, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, flags flew at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come "from the depths of the earth" back to the surface, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
The first explosion on 19 November also buried miners of British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine in New Zealand's South Island.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the scorching temperatures inside the mine, police chief Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warriors!
Is splatter suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries anew with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, especially because our hero likes to use ruthless killing methods and tears the intestines out of his enemies' living bodies,  when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, doesn't say a word throughout the film, and the other characters can only be carried away to one or two sentences or a few agonizing death screams.
Otherwise, there is silence and indulge in the creepy beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
It's nice if a film has several target groups, it's only a pity if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema fans are likely to be put off by the squirting brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when Einauge sets off for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck in the doldrums and fog for an eternity before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
So it's no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema distributor in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a film.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly constricts his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incredible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, faithfully at One's Eyeside, retains something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means perdition, but perhaps only for the already corrupt.
"Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, upset and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is refusing to comment on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Deir as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the cuboid with help from North Korea, hidden in a valley that goes off the flow.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence service CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA performed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Using computer animation, she showed where which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which was a miniature copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was about to be commissioned, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, and the mysteries have become greater over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, it saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied succinctly this summer that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians hurriedly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and leveled the area thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack via a member state, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA is therefore unable to independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always asserted that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is adamantly silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently reiterated the official position.
Since June 2008, the investigation into the case has dragged on without result and "is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency," as a senior Western diplomat admits at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna – after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA monitors.
As the key to progress in reconnaissance, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" with the alleged reactor - and unlike this still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants are involved, nor what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these locations and found a complex of buildings near Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately adjacent to a military base - precisely on this ground, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was later to be separated, there are at best plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could contain valuable traces, was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the face of the earth, no one wants information about where the rubble has gone.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a repository for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks at the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has done little to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to protect any military secrets - the effort alone shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also brushed off this proposal.
While Western diplomats in Vienna had reassured a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter was not highly urgent, US Ambassador Glyn Davies, for example, has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months now, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option I am open to in the future," but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this path: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA's Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What if they don't find anything in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the screenplay herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Not much more is known about it - but that alone is enough for unrest.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, whereupon some days of filming planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women War Victims wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked hard to familiarize herself with the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all sides involved a voice.
However, it remains vague in terms of content.
So a second synopsis to the film circulates on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds very different from the variant "rape victim has a crush on torturer".
That Jolie's film actually begins before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: By illegally posting the script, like so many before, on the Internet.
Get away from here
On this evening it is finally running really well again for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much for that.
The fans cheer for joy with loud music, they stomp their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is shaking because players throw ping-pong balls into beer cups over a three-metre distance - and hit.
"Beer pong" is the name of the bizarre spectacle, you can win a prize of 500 euros plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Beer Pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really go together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, to distract himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
On his plan is not fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have a job there yet."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had her dream job as an event manager in no time, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: Like the Tanners, many families on the island look like.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, predict experts at the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts come true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that from which Ireland suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of prosperity that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is once again spreading.
The economic crisis is unsettling above all the young, well-educated Irish, for whom things have only been going uphill so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd during the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was abundant.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times, letters to the editor abound from young emigrants complaining: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but those who can, go away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one will turn off the lights, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future looming because the government is just window dressing and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellow students move from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the topic of working abroad.
"For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take their first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build something somewhere else.
Because there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction site in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are currently building a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his home anymore, because he does extra shifts to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never before."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through chilled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways parked large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent debt-financed.
"Those were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears at the moment.
"Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen – maybe that's how we feel Irish."
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how life goes elsewhere.
He already has a few years of work in London behind him and why shouldn't things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Don't have too many emotions," he says, taking a big sip of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a casual party, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democratic routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support for private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the findings of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts stand out in this year's September and October surveys.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has risen sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at an annual rate of about 6% since 2002, the number of people in favour of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year's sharp slump.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch democrats, lowering the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice. This is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% trust their government. Both figures are the same as last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to achieve democracy.
That this continued during the Great Depression may be due to the fact that Latin American countries experienced only a brief period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were supported by a stronger social safety net.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, Latin America's poverty rate rose only marginally in 2009 and has fallen 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong differences in sentiment from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progressive mindset.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more pronounced and violent crime has increased.
For only the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see chart 5).
About 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. But from 38% last year, the figures have fallen, reaching their lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic output is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents nationally stated that the private sector is indispensable for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of a private sector), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electoral setback
No one expected that the November 28 elections in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who rushed to the aid of the troubled country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been displaced by the January earthquake, roamed in search of choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some presumed frontrunners, demanded the annulment of the election results due to alleged fraud.
Throughout the country, there were partly violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "These irregularities, serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly beholden to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected run-off election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support from voters, is declared the winner of the run-off by the electoral authority, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low voter turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for voting had not yet been distributed.
The stakes are high.
Donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following her husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rating up 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help her win re-election next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are ambiguous.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue as they saw fit.
On paper, the Fernández government lost its majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further discord.
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronists lined up behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one lawmaker slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss it," the president said.
The 2010 budget now applies to next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money as she sees fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands by the unions - push the figure to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not reducing inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC), which then glossed over official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt through a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached a deal with security holders who had opposed the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the backers from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always refused a review by the IMF, as was customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" in compiling a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step in cleaning up INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term ends without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which for the most part has had enough of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy they received will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching closer ties to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
On 27th November more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and councillors in the five districts. This is seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbolic figure of relations with the mainland. His policies have permanently changed relations with mainland China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) has three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received almost 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, Taiwanese incidents occurred, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass parades and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to DPP leader Tsai Ing-wen, the attack affected the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment too much.
She was responding to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants political integration. But first things first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of moderate politicians has developed and the DPP is fighting for the votes of working people and youth.
Tsai found broad support as the DPP's presidential candidate, as did Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it too is capable of establishing close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's premature rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even called on the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to elect its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's scores are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially in favour of rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly named Newcomer of the Year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the Year.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual. But it complies with Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her buoyant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared to Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category comes closest to Spalding's nomination.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This darling of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rapacious New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," won the Contemporary Jazz category, which usually features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category. He competes against the Billy Childs ensemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award contain a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is headed by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, ranging from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu" was performed by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" nominated by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece especially for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his baton.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval by planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will be an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes on both sides fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," read one comment.
"It's another planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand."
"America is finished."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the site of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two options."
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"That makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'alien' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists discovered, the bacterium continues to grow in California's Mono Lake even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report at Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study looks at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can set biochemical processes in motion with the help of other elements, and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Milton Keynes Open University in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she hypothesized that microbes exposed to both could potentially replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic has a different effect than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more abundant.
According to Jamie S. Foster, associate professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far, there has been no working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than in the early geological era," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and National Health Administrations.
Other stolen show dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen outside a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis — disappeared Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were housed outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well," Whitmore said.
"They are in good condition."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not specify where the dogs were found, nor the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more," Whitmore explains.
"We are following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old - were unharmed, according to authorities.
But the corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside their room window.
They took three other dogs—a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier, and a Brittany—into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window open a crack wide so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's fee would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new beginning.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially approved the "preparing" plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so nothing stands in the way of MGM's relaunch under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will head the somewhat slimmed-down studio as managing directors.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually go into effect until JPMorgan Chase has closed a planned $500 million bond to fund MGM's new productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, leads the company. The financing should be in place by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to investment bank Moelis & Co to help the company's management, which was struggling with interest payments of $300 million per year, solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert best known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial worries and pay off the studio's more than 140 Gläuber took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
But the auction attracted few bidders and none wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by creditors.
It all started all over again this spring when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
If MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who were paid $375,000 per month to run the company, will receive a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. That year, the studio released only one film and created an annual schedule of seven or eight films scheduled to hit theaters in early 2012.
They are also planning two films based on "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of MGM's loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the final negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is about 10 classic skipping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, looking for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers — a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into effect. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider range on the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming onto the market, and many include rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children ages 3 and up) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs, that sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pressing, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplay such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the innovative hinged feet with wheel locking, it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids 3 and up), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a know-it-all with autocorrect function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it aren't as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids ages 3 to 12), which comes with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there's Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for kids 8 and older). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out. It's great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go by the offer in the toy stores alone, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children ages 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The newest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids 5 and older) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can withstand a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across a city square, checking on his nervous subordinates and giving orders with military authority and a hushed voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan—China's rugged guardians of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and propensity for violence—to impress viewers.
"Stand straight!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of their teenage years, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
"They look average to me," Mr. Tang remarks disdainfully.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with staring down: In 2009, 50 officers reportedly circled an improperly set up food truck and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change its image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the city's police patrols. They were specially chosen for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are intended to give the rough-hewn police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
And rightly so, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers can only enforce city laws through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely paints a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat an onlooker to death when he filmed them using his cell phone to crush a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officers.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows Chinese-trained officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan is scaring the government," lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough purge."
Skeptics find the current approach clearly inadequate.
When the distrik was looking for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious facial features" were sought.
They should be larger than average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too physically demanding for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first of all on their external appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district municipal government, does not agree with this description.
admitted, however, that in China, size requirements in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is synonymous with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we don't need lame or hunchbacks here," Mr. Zheng said.
"Their image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She does not find it sexist that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short hire, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply chasing traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you this so many times!" explains Miss Xu to a merchant who fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in her spare time.
"It's all routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the merchants like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, to which officials in China are often exposed.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, and 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from quiet Baonguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, contrary to regulations.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with grim faces and drove away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind. He turned over his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we are verbal."
"But sometimes physically," Mr. Li explains matter-of-factly.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of charges brought against him following his affair with a former election aide and his attempt to get her husband lobbying, the senator's lawyers said Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which made national headlines and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "delighted" with the verdict after the year-long investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they have been informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign has been dropped and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The verdict came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 suggested that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his election aides, win lucrative contracts to buy his silence on an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during one of Ensign's election campaigns.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over lobbying for her after Hampton was hired.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called turn-door lobby ban.
According to the published evidence, "it appears to be collusion and a violation of revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the Department appeared very cautious about taking political charges after a host of defeats that were followed with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for wrongdoing by the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously scared," said Melanie Sloan, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers that has brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day telling him that the department would not bring charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Justice Department and me. Suffice it to say: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to drop the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging that a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal elections law.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that long supported the senator, was one of the firms where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work thanks to Mr. Ensign's help.
A December 2008 e-mail shows that after the firm advanced Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "knocking" on the door of the Home Office about something.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after it hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about this affair first came out last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican ranking.
After many months of unnoticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
Announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigations, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and drop its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in serving the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appointment draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them typed away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent their reports on gruesome witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut, family will officially come to an official end when the jury verdicts on the jury's death sentence are handed down.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed motions with the court setting out grounds for an appeal that will keep the courts busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – created a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, prompt penetration of inflammatory details that the jury was unduly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could prompt the courts of appeal to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead defense attorney.
The chief justice, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court last week, succinctly dismissed the motions by decision when he said that new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who allegedly killed his wife, saying in its decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say appeals that look at Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the lines of communication out of the courtroom, which were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is good reason to be concerned about the influence of new media in trials followed by the general public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts may be intrigued by the idea that restricting prompt communication from the courtroom could make trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers are laying out in order to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the judges said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her cousins, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with disgust.
Defense lawyers say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution and that he unduly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of extensive coverage of the trial are perhaps the most interested.
In a ruling they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated news in Connecticut and was being debated by the candidates during the campaign for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the new media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has never been seen before in New Haven and perhaps nationwide."
Their focus on Twitter's coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that claiming that these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are reported more slowly is an anti-technology view that impoverishes coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appelation courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the basis of the reporting, and made clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can politeness connect what divides?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little politeness has erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough on the big issues that had to be dealt with during the lame duck session, the session at the end of a term of administration in which no decisions are made.
From what one hears, governing was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an acknowledgment of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of partisan scoring.
Wednesday's public meeting of the President's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the policy differences that persist among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one demands from the other sign of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while they themselves try to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after another party warfare.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election gave Washington a mild vote, at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die away again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the lame duck session agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one is advocating it.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying assistance to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, optimism has risen that agreement on these issues can be reached during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the "lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical – and this skepticism is shared by many – that politeness leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today until 2012 as a preliminary, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
However concerned Republican leaders may be that they are playing poker too high, they know they must try to deliver on their promises to cut government spending and repeal health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own estimation, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation, and they are struggling hard to even come close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the body's elected representatives, as there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise on financial issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of partisan clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama over the federal budget, taxes, and health care, followed later by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, both parties must pay careful attention to public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Bipartisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they appear to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this sense, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting large protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of the bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" – takes its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that it has been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous defamation lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian television station: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredible number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This is what surveys have shown.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are named, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The Moscow government's direct association with crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection) that extends across the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Inspectorate (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov comes first."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Finally, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it said, "stated that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while the fundraising is comprehensive, the protection itself will be very modest none; Even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy's memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparence International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the American embassy memo, which happened late at night after Moscow time, will certainly provoke disapproval within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School commemorates the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the butcher" because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-time supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodia tribunal sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time when it sentenced former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Alnlong Veng's Khmer Rouge veterans, hampering their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization that studies the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary fought the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok raised the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not relented, was arrested by government forces near the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the gruelling poverty of rural Cambodia, and many remembered the movement nostalgically.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, on trial.
The court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue other acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials of the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court charged more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means collecting the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand everything."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's high school history book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and filthy with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will lay a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that it will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to continue accumulating weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article at the security summit.
The U.S. government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements had been reached with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material — about £500, according to an official who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the key outcomes of Obama's April "47-Nations Nuclear Security Summit," which ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We keep highly enriched uranium -- hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus nevertheless moved closer to the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and, according to the officials, was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going toward Belarusian research into low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and orchestrated to build trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Undisclosed Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Embracing the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No Spanish government objections to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a cable from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It adds that former deputy prime minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of aiding and abetting human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "hit Zapatero on the sidelines" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega emphasized that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "caught off guard," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges."
For his part, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a March 2007 lunch attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and do what they see fit," he had instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to ease tension."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to the matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt capitalizing on a suggestion that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be construed as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the U.S. government," he points out.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "hardship" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the Internet.
Under this nickname, which she has used from an early age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand them, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his former wife never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love affair broke up and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address where I can send you the boy."
She complains: "If he doesn't like the fact that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
"He will be with the one he needs to be, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intention, considering their bad relationship.
In July there will be another mail.
As she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On 17.: Erinnerungen und Klagen.
"A huge kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the email. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, such crap."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
There is one of Víctor, her current partner: "He advances money to me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, calling herself "Muki, the prison releaser."
"Terror a la gallega (heading)".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn game warden, declares to have pangs of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe it all happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca to the provincial prison of Palma.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of events, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecution requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular gained 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already turning its attention to the parliamentary elections - early or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party obtains in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this figure was only 316,222 in the regional elections in 2006.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the diversion of the PSC's share of the vote and the retention of the PP's electorate - continues, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could retain its MP or gain one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can tip the scales to put an end to socialist domination in four provincial capitals and, with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor fall back on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's municipal council, where it should win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had governed together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police officers of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Tamil Eelam Liberation Movement (LTTE) and Lashkar e-Taiba (Let), the author of the 2008 attacks in Bombay that claimed 106 lives.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assert that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and "thus its ability to act".
The researchers believe that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The exposed cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units also participated in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that in the next few days there will be attacks similar to the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
From Bangkok, they had headed the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - stole passports from tourists in particular in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents had to be issued in the names of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigators stress that so far no links have been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Lashkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipients of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia through a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "commando" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have confiscated extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone tax agreement
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas with her conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those already put forward during the election campaign and can be summed up by the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial equalisation agreement that the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with the certainty conferred on her by the 18 deputies she won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. Because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. The talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia.
As for the leader of the PPC, she demands that in support of the inauguration "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial equalization between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to subject to a referendum, be put on the back burner.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to streamline the exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
On the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are dealing with the details of the negotiations for Mas taking office.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reiterates that the deaths are not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
Those in charge of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday in which they highlighted the damage caused to the facility by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible during his work.
The director of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to prosecute the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability oblige us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social reputation because it did not detect the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pays a large amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities due to their age and illnesses were handled by telephone.
The director of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that "lack of action could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no evidence in the litigation of negligent acts by any person other than the accused."
The man who had already been baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he had committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines is difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will reveal whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less gruesome death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach lye, as he confessed to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, the nurse's statements are not believed, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it made no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to ECB President Trichet's threat, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The risk premiums of the euro periphery countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be mistaken and that the euro has barely gained any points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to back down tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase sovereign debt, as it was ineffective, as well as the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity to be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue and provide a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be set back, and if we are stubbornly insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reiterated that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and markets collapsed as a result, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management company spent only 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in market perception, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the problem with the July stress tests, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary approval for his new budget next Tuesday. As it still lacks sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse in view of the summit of heads of state and government on 14th December. Political unity is needed there to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as well as in financial institutions, reduction of the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons to investors.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange gained 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain was quick and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are counting on strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to restructure.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar's wife: "Now not only being counts, but also appearances."
Only courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen contests the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not subside.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate group, will contest the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it "absolutely null and void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services seems unwilling to back down in his legal battle over control of El Enebro's organs.
He was driven out of the board of directors by five of his seven children. At the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which has already been entered in the commercial register as contested, they appointed themselves members of the Board of Directors.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderclap in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Calling the judge to convene the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the annulled assembly of 18 January recognized by means of legal subtlety, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights," as official spokesmen explain.
This reasoning is the basis for challenging the Assembly retrospectively in order to declare it "absolutely null and void".
The same protagonists, who remain discreetly silent, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the case to be decided by the judge at the hearing on the handling of the action for annulment, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his soaring career over the last few seasons, everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari at the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to diminish the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens put into Red Bull's hands and thus created a winning team has become legendary.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer program, known as PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department at Siemens, explains that by using this software in the Formula 1 factory, Red Bull can design and execute the changes and improvements noted during the races and tests "in a few hours, almost in real time".
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the racing teams, who could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull's team employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's race cars, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its race cars in a town 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The workforce consists of 580 people, including the two drivers, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the service of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant's head of technology, points out that five years ago it could be said that advances in R&D for race cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while pilots' contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computing, because they "are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty of its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network of twenty stores, each measuring 80 to 100 square metres, which the multinational intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-chairwoman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for opening the store is always the same. It relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop fittings (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system, stressing that the exclusive network of points of sale was intended to "optimise customer service and advice to small and micro enterprises when purchasing and afterwards, even packaging".
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and micro enterprises and private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' a million customers from its rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell executive board member Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a collapse in interest rate spreads, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a still existing field.
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you subtract the customers that the bank will lose. This is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its retail customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, reduce costs. The challenges facing the Bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all bank plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima roadmap set four years ago this year. This was initially designed for three years, but due to the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the bank's main target.
At a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a long reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would come out of the crisis only "slowly".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years – fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he expects the war over liabilities - which penalises interest margins - to subside, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to maintain liquidity are already being passed on to the price of loans to compensate for shrinking profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on loans."
"We haven't turned off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that banks are currently pursuing the strategy of "increasing fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's mission plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate businesses.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change in the coming year," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing enormously" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be circulated, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of savings bank mergers
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of savings bank mergers and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Association of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica Group cannot be regarded as a second round, but rather as adjustments."
"Most of it has been completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, which strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "has been completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process established in the past, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which means that we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there are a number of undissuaded opinions about the slowness of the process, which reveal dubiousness and absurdity", because "Banco de España warns us to conclude on time before the end of the year".
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world, adding that those who doubt this do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we "do not have to worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and Germany's red line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for provoking the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of her public relations work.
On the contrary, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which collides with the preservation of the traditional traditions of the majority of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, people in Germany are beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this sounds more like science fiction at the moment - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishing countries that violate the targets; possibly, the cessation of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the drifting apart between what Germany felt was necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal was sent by the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was strongly criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public opinion and published opinion were absolutely against bailing out Greece.
After all, Merkel comes out again in the last days of October with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be rescued while obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it advanced the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, was accepted. In the coming months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which should make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, forced to default and, in this case, the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must pursue a hard growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a question of reducing the national deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will become more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood it that way, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday's meeting with big business and yesterday's announcement of new measures) indicates that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of putting her own house in order has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything will change.
Among the possibilities considered, it cannot be ruled out that we would have to leave the euro area, which is crammed with less serious countries.
In that case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and rule evasion
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) from the match on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will comply with the prescribed sanction in the next league match against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen over the case stems from the fact that a Real Madrid football club team (which pretends nobility and honour in its anthem and on other occasions punished its players for similar incidents) played the leading role, and the dramatisation by Mourinho, who has added one more episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention of the rules. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its purpose.
In this matter, the damage caused to sportsmanship should be investigated.
The sportsmanship defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of clean play is to prevent the offending players from taking undue advantage from the opposing team. That didn't happen either.
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand by cheating or circumvention of the rules, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and happily accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derived from the intentional fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither put in a less favorable position nor were advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that one's own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, as the team could also be eliminated at some point. In addition, with this approach, players receive a sanction and go to the second card cycle, in which they are eliminated due to accumulation of cards with one card less than in the first cycle.
So it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices do not go against sportsmanship, which includes strategic decisions to maximise the benefits of the rules.
In this case, players didn't want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule evasion), they rather wanted to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the line between inventiveness and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive to catch customers for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid for by employees themselves are spreading. You don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, which supply oxygen to Barcelona's catering and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they are triggering a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the masses: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week of December 13th, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many employees pay for it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, the lowest prices are being demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Restaurants Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think twice before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but they pay close attention to prices," he points out.
Business will go well with those "who offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are the most in demand.
A survey in various centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros are booming. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
For another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible in order to maintain last year's prices with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 restaurants, is not losing optimism after revenues have been flourishing again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business are expected, albeit concentrated on a few days.
Group sources point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more as a price hit. One gets the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and want more details in return, such as cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that group meals are on the upswing again.
On the part of the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that reservations are quite "lively" overall, although customers "get the maximum out of it".
However, the fun of partying has not decreased, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program causes great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Wikileaks revelations confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the US state department, revealed by Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern about Washington's nuclear program.
On the sidelines of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that nuclear security cooperation between the two countries is not being strengthened, but on the contrary "diminishing," and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their components are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - gives Washington sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists the following risks in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersal of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen as excessive not only by the US, but also by Russia, and as a reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire devout personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to reclassify people involved in nuclear or missile programs," Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentary revealed by Julian Assange's website is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning and the accelerated pace at which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communications with Pakistan as "frustrating" declared: "Often there is no transparency; we do not receive answers to offers of help or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian state intelligence official, confirmed that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons faster than any other country."
Ambassador Patterson, during a visit by the Supreme Army Commander, General Ashfaq Kayani, asks Washington to "clarify" to the person responsible that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior in charge of the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning to pursue and locate Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "find and prosecute" Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, it dates from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
That is the way things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization, many member countries consider the red warning to be a carte blanche for arrest – which must be carried out by the national police – especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be staying.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who gestures published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer questions from Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied to leave Sweden and received permission from the prosecutor, who is compared to the fabled Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution," the letter charges.
While the world searches for him - and his mother protests her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is in an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location. During the conversation, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Rusell Travers, with preventing new revelations of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House of Representatives' National Security Committee starting in January, has called on the state department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to retract his statement that Assange must be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is too lenient punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod Allies
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret ballot on his continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the ERC, which is directionless after the loss of 11 deputies and half of the vote.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying with a wink to win over the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For starters, it announced yesterday that ERC's more than 200 regional council members could secretly comment on his remaining in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the cathodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would not feel vindicated with half the votes plus one, and he added, without specifying percentages, that a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Allies demand more from the president than just to make his office available to the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme body of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
In return, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the strategic reorientation document that the leadership will put to the vote on 18 .dem Council.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he should promise to bring the congress forward to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The ERC leader believes that "polyphony" harms stability and seeks once and for all to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by acting conseller Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange against different goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the executive committee so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, i.e. the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the principle of assembly as a way of working.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, which fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the trembling meeting of 2008, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of general assembly at a congress that was supposed to deal with reforming the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle the internal calm of recent years was not advisable to tackle this matter.
Now, with critical sectors lying in wait, the time may have come to reopen this matter and close it forever.

In the San Francisco Acuautla settlement of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with bullet shots from firearms in her neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and chains with corresponding images were discovered on the woman's skin.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three bullet holes and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with duct tape and a notice were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, which read: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two handcuffed bodies with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the justice center of the settlement of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and tied up in black plastic bags, next to it was a message. The second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
China's representative said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to eliminate 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China's climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy law that includes targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, state authorities have worked with those of the central government and municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also said that a number of multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Effective Use Programme, which was launched over the past five years and received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private sources.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another to mitigate and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, the government's scientific advisor on climate change in the country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy effectiveness has increased by twenty percent in the last five years, and another is expected by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panic party leader had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barriento's expulsion was lawful and that the former leader of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission and demand what the right granted to him.
In an interview that took place before Gabino Cué Monteagudo's appeal as governor of the state, he explained that Espino's expulsion was a decision made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision by the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, when his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and served its purpose," he said.
The panicked leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairperson Acción Nacional needed for the next three years. Therefore, he handed over the relay "to the one whom the Council would determine."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to appoint the office of party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last elections on July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it was not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa carry the flag and are observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are placed in her and I am sure that Gabino is up to the task."
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his dissipation during his four-year government, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them should they finally get out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government can make expressions such as those he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no ban on the mouth and even less censorship.
Obama advocates for the law in favor of undocumented students on Twitter
"If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and push for the passage of this law," tweeted the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today backed the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and push for this bill to pass," Obama tweeted.
His text message contains a cyberlink to a larger document urging the public to contact their senators as the vote on the bill is imminent.
"With your voice waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The news spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any bill unless the expansion of Bush-era tax breaks and government funding were expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about the Republicans' blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timeline could be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act bill, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under sixteen years old, had lived in that country for the past five years, and were enrolled in higher education or the army.
But the law's proponents need sixty votes to pass the initiative, so they need the votes of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of advocates of this project are influencing the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants stood up for the narrative
"I understand the sex in language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "gets us into trouble," the Argentine writer sat sweetly at the audience, composed mainly of young people gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz subsequently characterized as a great story. Luisa narrates in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to find out what a "wound" is and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but clues for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she "only learned about the wound that it was really open and did not exist". But she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its pitfalls are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful tale, which he called 'Praise of Invention', in which the finger in the wound, although not mentioned, is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back well-travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a U-turn and told of America, the great novel, which from the beginning did not lack its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame."
However, he points out that "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best", and there reality and lies converge, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls this the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment," she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and commitment that build up between the author and the reader like a "chemical reaction."
The evening ended with the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the wounds of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also boil down to dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no, and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuance often means putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer,  He noticed dividing the world into black and white and invited us to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano can look back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the clash between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different styles dictated by their respective coaches also face each other, and their contrasting encounter is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano can look back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held up well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has become the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and, amazingly, he has played successive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take another setback, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but on the penalty he advanced 3-1 and got two opportunities to take his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be haunted by misfortune again and free himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I indulge in, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when asked about the lost finals.
He still remembers the last final strongly, he assures that he has learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we on the line are prepared, the players too, because last time we were already prepared for it with two penalties.  and I think that's a lesson, until the game is over, there's no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-outs does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get to the penalty shoot-out, you want to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate gave us a bad game,  sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to hold the title in our hands, that left us something for this final, and we hope that this time it will not come to that."
It is in Romanso's power to no longer be just the second champion and to taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves to the consulate at the visa application service centres before their interview; Costs become waiting times are thus shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, visa application procedures at the United States Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants have to present themselves to the visa application service centres (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their interview at the consulate.
ASC staff will record the applicant's biometric data, which will be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for dealers and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not need to have an interview at the consulate, they just have to present themselves at the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is collected at the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the interview at the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found at the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have implications for the search for living things in space.
The United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts. This is a science that studies the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervising find for the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation among experts in other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments previously thought to be uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all conceivable life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances increase that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, different from the one we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its find tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon) by asking whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organic law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and already an opposition bloc was installed, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the opening session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the organic law because it would exclude them.
This reform, they repeated, would introduce a 'two-party system,' because now it would be two people, the same number as parties controlling Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms, the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political marginal position.
He said they would talk to PAN and PRI representatives in the coming days to change the pattern. They proceeded from their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"So far I (the opposition coalition) come, that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system."
"For starters, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues so that they become more," explained the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and PRI, pointed out that the congress had now turned into a 'booty' for two.
"Before, it was just one party, now they split it up in pairs."
Patrón Montalvo requested that the deputies be respected and assigned their seats at the negotiating tables.
"Five MEPs, who will probably be nine MEPs, must not be left out because of top decisions. The five, who are currently seen as being split into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform."
200,000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year amounts to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Council's transparency page, this cheque with the number 9258447 issued for an amount of 200,144.56 pesos was issued last November 16 with the purpose of "settlement of open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already indicated that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. It is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, consequently, the number of cheques still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from them, they just paid the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last one of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law when a company is questioned by ASE to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on 25 July the examination of the cheques issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that earlier, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places urgently need to be improved
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the burglary of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Merchants' Association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions there have been calls to cultivate the destination and to transform the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had had a negative impact, as tourists came to stroll and sow the clutter, after which they would turn their backs on nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a business one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise, they wouldn't be carrying out the construction work slowly and haphazardly in this way."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take its responsibility and avoid something like this happening again. How is it supposed to do that? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because it is not only because it is a tourist area that it needs to be maintained, we inhabitants also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. There must be a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and the tourist attractions constantly in good shape," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these precautions and these types of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán, because they are not used properly and create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that needed to be spruced up along with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive for tourism and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business industry of Mazatlán demands a dignified parliament, free of agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from EMP. That makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do clean work, to be committed to society and the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the Entrepreneurs' Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between parties, because it is customary for them to reach agreements that represent their own interests, turning them into carnival extras of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they do trustworthy work and, above all, stand up for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, says that one of the great challenges facing the 40 elected representatives is to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the state budget in order to promote it.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the second fewest resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislatures, must be updated.
Holy King is wanted
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are longing for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes on Epiphany, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes they crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no steady job.
"Sometimes hard times are called for because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell tangerines and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the brats to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'monster car' for some time and Cayetana suggests clothes for one-year-olds for his eight-month-old brother Jesús.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I would love this monster,' but I replied, 'Let's wait and see, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten-year-old Isaías is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can take part in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network, around ten house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in the places that are said to have served mainly for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used for production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men believed to be the main masterminds of the drug ring are from Sherbrooke.
The arrested people are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, its possession for sale purposes, conspiracy and servicing crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation that took place for more than a year.
"The information obtained from the public sector has enabled us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel specified.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department took part in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be tracked
The Conservative bill, which the government says will address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be scrapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this Charter."
"I stand with a party that has put shackles to your feet," Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberals, told the assembled deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person coming from a seagoing vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates Canada's constitution of law and freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it went against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does," M. Duceppe said.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's NDP immigration issue has dismissed critics who say her party is not steadfast enough in the face of clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against stowaways, and that's what we're trying to get through through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and holds children captive for at least a year," Chow said.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Secretary Kenney replied.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative told QMI that the government would call a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately explain himself to his voters.
The new unity does not meet with unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public committee of inquiry into the subject.
Robert Dutil, Secretary of Public Safety, claims that this idea was not yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
Still, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on October 29 last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement as a "rabbit conjured out of a hat" and "a solution made at the end of a table" in terms of public safety.
Minister Dutil, for his part, had addressed those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future entity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he contented himself with affirming.
"People are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, president of CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to set up a committee of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA. College for the training of senior civil servants).
To break this impasse, he proposes that Quebec give the Audit Office a special mandate to investigate corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also argues that Quebec could give audit control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow them to require people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the penal code to be more attuned to this type of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is ambiguous.
For his part, Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, was currently working on certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people were arrested, although the penal code had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has poured into some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
One street has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation poured over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimetres of rain showers had fallen here.
Since to this precipitation must be added the snowmelt that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, it is feared that several watercourses will overflow.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued warnings about the flood alert on the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an alternative bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
For its part, the Quebec National Flood Center issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise of several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially rebuked
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before Canada's Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians, as well as his abusive speech on radio.
The CCNR argues that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements contain "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustifiably negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such uncouth speech that is inappropriate to daytime broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide, which included the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violated the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning comments made during the programmes broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint lodged by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the programme "Dupont le midi" in question would have addressed a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not censured against his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in a media-effective debate that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained that he had not donated to Haiti Aid, because it was not known with certainty whether the needy would really receive the donations.
The Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative portrayal of Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the presenter explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the spread of crude language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond his obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, was supposed to communicate its decisions once during prime time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact kung-fu), kickboxing and Thai boxing, is now climbing the tatami and boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I look for combat everywhere, because for those who don't like ground combat as presented by mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the security guard and UPS employee had given bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals from World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championships held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"At the moment I'm preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"Those fighters from each category who had placed in the top four at the last World Championship had been invited."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China, in which punches and kicks as well as floor throwing are permitted.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter that has emerged from this type of martial art is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal withheld only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most prestigious in China," explained the likeable pound guy.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed with project planning firms to award $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a byproduct of Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over to the private sector its responsibility to hand over this important hydroelectric project to the tune of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, recourse to consortia of companies is a serious ethical problem which creates the risk of exclusion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of rigged play and weakens the competition."
"This means that instead of rigged games, instead of secret games, you are now conducting them in an open form," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to him to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract had been a rigged game.
"I remain true to my line," she railed, reiterating that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and that it "lacked toughness."
She said it was "the minimum" for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium's model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of the scale of its work.
The construction process is underway and should be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition being able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, the consortium's model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A quick scan of the Quebec Business Register reveals more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of permanent duration.
In this way, Dessau, for example, works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, goes back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the "Énergie gérance" consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 70s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that turned up its nose at the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
"If you advertise and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this market and tell yourself: they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte affirmed.
This contract, granted to the "Énergie gérance" consortium, is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts have been approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract with Énergie gérance.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that "financed" it, before specifying that they were rather their executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but outright skeptical.
Quebec consumers have little confidence in the key players of sustainable growth, but neither do they have confidence in the labelled brands or eco-labels that are supposed to guide their choice.
It is a pity, despite the fact that it is bathed in a high-profile universe teeming with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has to deplore a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that is a brake on its commitment, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they pushed the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as much as they do green corporate advertising, according to the sophisticated measuring instrument devised by the responsible consumer center at the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
Following the same pattern, the politicians' discourse on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption, however, seems important to stimulate this segment of consumption, which is currently enlivened by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the eagerness of 46% of consumers.
After the higher price of the products, this is the second brake identified by the barometer.
Moreover, one-third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to the barometer, 61% of them had also preferred purchases from retailers in their neighbourhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the eco-conscious consumption index had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its footprint in the environment by caring about animal welfare.
But social and environmental awareness still seems to stop at their cars, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport or preferred carpooling in 2010 to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of respondents to this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they demanded.
The government has agreed to get involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond of less than initially hoped for, which could bring about a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to the sources that can be gleaned from the state rumor mill.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the request has since been revised downwards again in total.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of owners of the cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have to provide financial aid for real estate projects there that he had not given to other cinemas.
In contrast, several other market participants in the segment sued for substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema boss Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years with great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele engaged.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are heading for a privately financed campaign, from which they hope to raise a sum of $ 700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not dismissed the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignores what he and his group think of the downwardly revised proposals that have been made to them.
Mystery of complex Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic leaderships disseminated by WikiLeaks reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians vis-à-vis the Americans; but with the same blow they reveal the latter's sense of superiority over Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government push through its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly circulated yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations ceased to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"An almost inherent inferiority complex that Canadians may be much more likely to cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to pass the buck to the United States in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more so, a party leader to maintain such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the election."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be found in the January 22, 2009, message sent by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade resulting from a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus program," Breese said.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to adjourn the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent parliament from being toppled by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties in this way would affect the quality of the proposed stimulus programme.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast on CBC by the United States.
The ambassador is disturbed by programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations conducted by CIA musclemen.
Yet another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was prepared to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file again."
Finally, let's note that tempers are heating up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old adviser who is very close to Stephen Harper, had declared via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan to renew lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (CFCs) equivalent to almost one-third of the additional reductions needed to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to earth due to lighting would be avoided if the incandescent bulbs, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, another 5 Gt would have to be deducted from this balance in order to stabilize the climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this energy requirement is reduced by a factor of two.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, which gives an idea of the savings potential of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide a collection point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would generate as a result of this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars annually in the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion to build.
Côte d'Ivoire eagerly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of Côte d'Ivoire's presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and announce the preliminary results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
"It asks all parties and institutions of Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had missed the deadline, which was set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were many calls from around the world for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the annulment by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of Côte d'Ivoire's presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN's manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo's complaints are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo's opponents are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically close associate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies insist that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday's presidential election was seen as the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided in two for years.
The United Nations had warned on Wednesday the politicians of the Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible in case of possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round of voting on 31st October with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (ILO), the unemployment rate in France in the metropolis is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working-age population in the metropolis and 9.7% including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
On closer inspection, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find work; This includes whether they were operational every two weeks or not, or whether or not they were looking for work.
The situation of young people on the labour market continued to deteriorate, with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the ILO.
Seniors, for their part, recorded a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 people over 50, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only those aged 25-49 had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues in this method, announcing on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste management company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), was investigated and sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into the public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of company assets, embezzlement of common goods, receiving stolen goods, complicity in corruption, illegal bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the public prosecutor's office will ask him, instead of spreading fantasies."
"It's easy to accuse him of a number of criminal charges, it's another matter to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first PS (Parti socialiste) man in the department, had made it a point to send the judge, through his lawyers, a memoradum to justify his case before his hearing.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
With regard to the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have known, according to Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Metropolitan Public Service, was also charged with embezzlement and complicity on Wednesday, but then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The chief prosecutor took into account not depriving him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were indicted and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to deputy chief prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants in the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one for the title of "evasion and misappropriation of common property by a public service officer" and the other for "complicity in the misappropriation of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with "receiving stolen goods and embezzlement of company assets".
Among the people confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public fraud involving Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of having contributed to laundering money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste management sector, was conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Sources close to the investigation show that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the award and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also sources waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediation function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage," kept the French public on tent, putting diplomacy on alert and accentuating the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give them advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of wanderers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the American judiciary for trafficking in material for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they cast a harsh light on the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to make them believe the idea that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram issued in Paris on August 12, 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way hostage-taking is handled."
François Richier, Elysée strategic adviser, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to repatriate their own nationals, who were being forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulate loud and clear and without ceasing" the words "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silence solves nothing", over the discussion attempts over in an inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which should take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians could "arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but remains held in Iran.
Information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from custody following the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing Iran's illegal networks of acquiring material destined for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of another meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François assures Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision by the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings managed by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make people believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential mediating role" through statements and "escape attempts" organized by the media.
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, noting that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "gratitude" to Mr. Assad based, asks the Paris embassy.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall for this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 that at the time "was perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to her: "of course we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Cinderella" that will ban young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials indicated.
A bill calling on online gaming operators to ban young people under the age of 16 from accessing these games after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of education and family ministries said.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the ministerial commissioner in charge of the draft law at the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games are then accessible again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturing companies have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for accessing these games to young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also make free programmes available to those who wish to do so, which will make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
In a fierce on suspicion of corruption, FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the scramble for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; The International Football Federation hopes to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets the level of economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations by bringing about the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances of its own country, cradle of football, which was allowed to host the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC had given this breeding ground again on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that takes three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to anger FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who had lobbied intensively with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move made by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to restore England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not lacking in trump cards with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the British, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport), has become a major outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, to denounce the committee's blunt insinuation of the English press's accusations of "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote".
"You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them," Putin railed.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that helped organise the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA's long-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes Asia's chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar pulling out all the stops by hosting futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion into new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights acknowledged by European countries (due to the time difference), FIFA's sensitive nerve.
Second mandate: obviousness
De Gaulle had really trimmed.
Mitterrand had made it believe that he was puzzled.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not sit well on the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters pretended that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing in it themselves.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy solemnly assured that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that he would hint at the prospect of "two mandates" in front of the UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in the Elysée had therefore spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you still have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I don't think about the phase after that."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more of a candidate than the day before; But no less.
If they provoke comments, it is for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that exhorts many members of the PS to declare war earlier than expected.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express poll).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," reacted immediately and cautiously the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he found a defeat possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned himself to obviousness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year was intended to provide an opportunity to show ways to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the imposition of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to certainly not afford to forfeit the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving Europe's public debt.
She did not dare say whether she thought the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its programme of government bond purchases.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his plans the day before in Brussels at his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but rather contented himself with pointing out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would "continue" and that at the meeting on Thursday we "will see:  how the decisions turn out".
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's bond purchases doubled last week to around €1.35 billion.
And according to leaks by some traders, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of €67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among dealers about the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable change of course.
If the borrowing operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB will still have to deal with the unrestricted cash reserves in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already preparing for this measure to be extended by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in any significant way."
"Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," suspects Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that stimulates the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs approach the creators of the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states," a key bondholder testified yesterday.
After all, if interest rates soar, governments would be prevented even more from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government takes cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the decline in key interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional leaders Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at any rate, the gap in German interest rates had reached a record 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed "grave concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the concomitant, dwindling tax receipts, which put the state in danger of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italy is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget under consideration by the Senate expects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates that the budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, because Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, ed.), is expected to make less progress towards stabilisation than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political discontinuity remains.
On 14th December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organised as early as the end of March.
It is therefore an unfavourable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans consider strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had emphasized it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans clearly stick together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although completely relative, the deduction in the interest rates of European government bonds recorded yesterday was grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
However, there can be no talk of a normalization start yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt note, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly heavily on banking systems," said economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions with a view to reinforcing the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 counterparts are progressing well.
And this also with a view to the Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the eurozone in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU stability funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asian tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first paper issues by the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative told Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in funds mobilized by the IMF's additional, direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures but are expected to have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are following a different path from that taken by Greece and Ireland.
Both must avoid at all costs having to seek international assistance before they have set up their own budget correctives and decided on essential structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to dig into its own pockets again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, the most prominent player in the European sovereign debt market, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means exists: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being closely examined in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions come to a head.
Snow and black ice: 24 departments on orange alert
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the impending risk of snow and black ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows lightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover of 2 to 5 cm, in places also of 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm, are expected in the Paris region.
The regions concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic disruptions and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using one's own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were planned for heavy goods traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "urges motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris' Roissy airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, one recalls the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then enable the SGP to lend part of the financial sum on the markets at twice its level.
Today, the first projections have finally been made.
The supplementary budget of 2010, reviewed this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on infrastructure and higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the resulting product and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that yield?
A mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
The 4 billion are a long way off.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital endowment raised by the State and gradually paid to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the explanatory statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e.), you can cover the project for three years and then draw from the 4 billion," it explains.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that in 2013 it will begin to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the promised 4 billion of which will be sought for a long time to come, runs the risk of provoking a rather turbulent parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and industrious spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (of any other nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits yield nothing more than what you have been reading for months in any journal (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's frighteningly cartooned profile has long provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches.
The rule that secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi sent to the State Department by the American Embassy in Rome was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why was there such a fuss about the revelations of these dossiers?
On the one hand, these say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representative tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims, but rather the "executioners" in distress.
But let's address the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, all power could be concentrated like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of its subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you consider what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control stop being one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can learn the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets survive?
True, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrecy, since it exposes the public sphere; but to expose in the style of WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to deprive her of all power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but it did Clinton and Obama any wrong.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a formidable power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer put any reserved information online - this would be tantamount to a notice stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state traveled on an airplane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships intended only for certain ears be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction sounds like science fiction and novelistic at the moment, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, busily moving secretly along uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages nowhere else than in mere memory, and moreover the little written information they have received.  in the heel hidden.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that nowadays technology is progressing like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph with a (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to explore a film volume by volume by rewinding from back to front and revealing all the secrets of montage, while the (numerical) CDs today allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains take three hours from Rome to Milan, while it takes three and a half hours by plane, including transfers.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France glosses over its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the fast-start or premature financing promised by developing countries.
And already the crude French whitewashes are exposed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed action report by its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued for its intrinsic value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which puts it on the right track to pay respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional deployment was brought in without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark they consider best.
The European Commission, for example, has chosen the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained, and will be added 150 million over three years as part of the "Fast-Start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the ODA level.
In return, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for previous year's spending or at global ODA level.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease) - France claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses their own calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find €1 borrowed equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission control based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as the equivalent of one donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan should be counted as a commitment to the donor country (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking out 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to see for itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans on a large scale.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) fulfill their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands it as a comparable stake.
Nice hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates with a double fraud in its fast-start financing: partly with an evolution of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros in the process.
The manipulation of the Treasury (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter on premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Be that as it may, it is essential to learn the lesson of this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could take forward the discussions on the issue of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently discussed issue): it cannot escape the question of "offsetting" or the way in which its loans are recorded.
France could change its position to be as progressive on issues as it is on other issues.
So the hope is pinned on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's near-start and its vision of "offsetting" and the use of loans would, by its very nature, raise the international basis of trust needed for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 takes 81 different chemical substances a day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that its results "do not reflect a statistically significant value given the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", had bought between July and September the food usually consumed within four meals by a child of about ten years of age plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals—including official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit portions, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water per day—were studied, as well as sweets by laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine confounding factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded, it is very clear from this survey that the reality in which the user may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptors is worrying," notes the association.
At breakfast, butter and tea with milk alone contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three that have been safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the endocrine system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the minced steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum were peppered with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 identified chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not uncontaminated.
The ultimate risk of this "cocktail of pollutants" to the consumer "is likely to be underestimated," according to the study.
For its part, the Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
