Last month, there were major protests in Poland when the country signed ACTA, which led to the Polish government deciding not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the ACTA accession process.
The animal welfare organisations Animal Liberation and Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again calling for surveillance cameras to be installed in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA New South Wales Chief Inspector David O'Shannessy told ABC that monitoring and inspections of slaughterhouses should be the order of the day in Australia.
Video surveillance would certainly send a clear message to people who work with animals that their welfare is most important."
The US Geological Survey's international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic Meteorological Service has also detected no earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The main earthquake activity that led to the phase transition had taken place on 10 March on the northeast side of the summit crater of the volcano.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity have been reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds created confusion as to whether an eruption had occurred.
"The "Luno" had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when she was in distress and the strong winds and waves pushed her against the breakwaters."
The twelve crew members were rescued by helicopter and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long vessel was en route to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and authorities had originally feared that a cargo might leak.
The proposed amendment was already approved by both chambers in 2011.
There was a change in this legislative period, when the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives and then passed in a similar form by the Senate on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex registered partnerships, could potentially open the door to registered partnerships in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be re-examined by the next elected legislator in either 2015 or 2016 to remain in process.
Among Vautier's achievements outside of filmmaking was a hunger strike in 1973 against what he regarded as political censorship.
French law has been amended. His activism began during World War II when he was 15 years old and joined the French resistance.
He documented himself in a book from 1998.
In the 1960s he returned to newly independent Algeria to teach directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was given as intrahepatic bile duct cancer.
He died on Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only a former Olympic champion and world champion, but also the chairman of the training commission of the All Japan Judo Federation until his death.
At least 100 people had attended the celebration to celebrate the first wedding anniversary of a couple whose wedding took place last year.
A formal anniversary event is planned for a later date, officials said.
The couple got married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught at Modern Education and King's Glory and is said to have had 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents found crude and allegedly swear words in class.
The modern education system accused him of having large advertisements put on buses without permission and of lying when he said he was the presiding English tutor.
He had already been accused of copyright infringement, but had not been sued.
One former student said that he "used colloquial language in class, taught flirting techniques in comments, and was simply a buddy of the students."
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy, although officially it remained a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economic power has increased ninety-fold.
China exported more cars than Germany for the first time last year, overtaking the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China's gross domestic product could surpass that of the United States within two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic.
During the storm, about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) are measured.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict Danielle will escalate into a hurricane by Wednesday.
Since the storm is still far from invading the country, it is still difficult to estimate the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, quickly became known while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined in 1945 and remained until 1958.
During his time in the team, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
No one else has ever made more appearances or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was voted the best player in the history of Partizan in 1995.
The celebrations began with a special show by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
This was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a Janissary band and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then spinning dervishes appeared.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"Finally, the Turkish dance ensemble Fire of Anatolia performed "Troy"."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died after being involved in an accident at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warm-up lap, Lenz crashed off his motorcycle and was then run over by his racing colleague Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately treated by the medical staff at the circuit and taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Regarding the global financial situation, Zapatero went on to say that "the financial system is a part of the economy, a vital part.
"We have a year-long financial crisis that has had its most intense time in the past two months and I think now the financial markets are starting to recover."
Naked News announced last week that it was significantly expanding its international mandate for foreign language reporting with three new programs.
The global organization, which already reports in English and Japanese, begins broadcasting programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the Internet and mobile devices.
"Luckily, nothing happened to me, but I saw gruesome scenes as people tried to smash windows to get out.
People banged on the glass with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the panes eventually broke and then they started climbing through the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Through the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are fused (or fused) to form heavier elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists are working to develop a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is an extremely difficult task, so it will take many years before actually usable fusion reactors are built.
Because of the surface tension, the steel needle floats on the water.
Surface tension arises because the water molecules at the water surface attract each other more strongly than they are attracted by the air molecules above.
The water molecules form an invisible layer on the surface of the water that allows objects such as the needle to float on the water.
The blade on a modern skate has a double edge with a concave indentation in between. The two edges allow a better grip on the ice, even when tilted.
Because the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice also curves when the blade tilts from one side to the other.
As a result, the skater turns. If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they need to get rid of the extra energy they received from the Light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a "photon."
"Scientists call this process 'stimulated emission of radiation,' because the atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing a photon of light to escape, and light is a type of radiation."
The next image shows how the atoms emit photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than in the image.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the bulb eventually burns out and the bulb stops working.
The bulb must then be replaced. It is necessary to be careful when changing the bulb.
First, the switch of the luminaire must be switched off or the cable connection interrupted.
The reason for this is that the current flowing into the bracket for the metal part of the bulb can give you a strong power surge if you touch the inside of the mount or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partially in the bracket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood flows away from the heart in vessels called arteries and comes back to the heart in vessels called veins. The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
The dentition of a triceratops was able to crush not only leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that Triceratops ate cycads. This is a plant species that was common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like small palm trees with a crown of pointed, sharp leaves.
A Triceratops may have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants were very poisonous and therefore probably no dinosaur would have eaten them, although today the sloth and other animals, such as parrots (descended from the dinosaurs), can eat poisonous leaves and fruits.
How would Io's gravity affect me? If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So, of course, gravity pulls less on you.
Unlike Earth, the sun does not have a crust to stand on. The entire sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas gets thinner the farther you get from the center of the sun.
"The outer region we see when we look into the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'ball of light.'"
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus, just like the moon, has phases.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or moon) facing the sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus support Copernicus' theory that the planets orbit the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelag.
In 991, however, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than any other since Guthrum's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to regain his country from Danish rule.
After initial military setbacks, Æthelred was able to agree on conditions with Olaf. The latter returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with varying success.
Hangeul is the only deliberately invented alphabet that is used by many people today. The alphabet was invented in 1444, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and is one of the most revered.
Originally, he called the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the right sounds for teaching people."
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit. One of them is about the immigration of the Aryans from the West to India, who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit receded for hierarchical reasons.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that acted as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the Battle of France ended, Germany prepared for the invasion of the British Isles.
Germany gave the attack the code name "Operation Sea Lion". Most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were stationed near the likely invasion routes, as the admirals feared that they might be sunk in a German air raid.
Let's start with an explanation of the Italian plans. Italy was first and foremost the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although it had built four new ships just before the start of the war.
Italy's main destinations were African countries. To conquer these lands, they needed a launch site for the troops so that the troops could sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To do this, they had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from that, Italy's battleships should have no further role.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to go underwater and stay there for an extended period of time.
U-boats were used in the First and Second World Wars. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range of fire.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly moved on the sea surface, but as radar evolved and became more and more accurate, the submarines were forced to dive to avoid being seen.
The word U-boat was also used in the version "U-Boat" in English, which specifically meant German U-boats. The Germans were very good at navigating and controlling their submarines.
Because of their success with U-boats, the Germans were not trusted to own many of them after the war.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as "King Tut" or "The Boy King", is today one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in antiquity and was not included on the oldest king lists.
However, the discovery of his burial chamber in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many tombs of ancient times were robbed, his tomb remained almost untouched.
Most of the items with which Tutankhamun was buried are well preserved, as are thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the spoke wheel, Assyrian chariots became lighter, faster and better able to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could pierce the armor of enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced cavalry.
A cavalry is a force that fights on horseback. Since the saddle had not yet been invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought from the bare back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the best-known figure of this culture is the legendary blind poet Homer, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey".
Sophocles and Aristophanes remain popular playwrights, and their plays are among the greatest works of world literature.
Another well-known Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is best known for his famous theorem about the aspect ratios of right-angled triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether very closely related dialects are counted or not.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers. Up to 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary but a different script; in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under great cultural influence from Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people and thus developed the Estonian written language.
It was based on the German alphabet and one letter, namely "Õ/õ", was added.
Over time, many words borrowed from German merged. That was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the military after finishing school.
However, Charles then studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history, at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating 2-2 (a degree without special distinction).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a university degree.
The European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) comprises 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey, with a length of more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and a width of 800 kilometers (500 miles), resembles a rectangle in shape.
The territory of Turkey, including the lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey's area makes it the 37th largest country in the world and is about the size of the European part of France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides – the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but has only been independent since 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.
Although Luxembourg had always tried to remain a neutral country, it was occupied by Germany in both the First and Second World Wars.
Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union in 1957.
The Drukyel Dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of Paro District (in the village of Phondey).
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is said to have built the fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory against Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire caused only a few remnants of the Drukyel dzong to survive, including the image of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
After the fire, the fort was preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was squeezed between two powerful neighbors – Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia in the last years of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed and most workers work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of working Venezuelans work in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and one-fifth in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil. Although only one percent of the workforce is employed in the oil industry, the country is a net exporter here.
Early in the nation's independence, the expertise of the Singapore Botanic Garden helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid crossbreed, was named the country's national flower in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate to the southern plains and cross the Mara River from the northern hills because of the rains.
And then back north through west, with another crossing of the Mara River after the rains in April.
The Serengeti area includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Reserve and Maswe Wildlife Park in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Park in Kenya.
Learning how to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to challenge your assumptions about media production and learn to think in non-linear ways.
Interactive design requires that the components of a project connect with each other, but that they also make sense as separate entities.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focusing and the number of lens elements required for a focal length range are much greater than fixed focal length lenses.
This problem is becoming less and less significant as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
As a result, zoom lenses were able to produce images of a quality comparable to that of fixed focal length lenses.
Another disadvantage of telephoto lenses is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
That's why cheap zoom lenses are hard to use in low-light situations without flash.
One of the most common problems in converting a movie to DVD format is overstunning.
Most televisions are made to please the general public.
That's why everything you see on TV is cut off at the top, bottom and sides.
This is to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called overscanning.
Unfortunately, the edges will most likely also be cut off when making a DVD, and if the subtitles are too close to the bottom of the video, they will not be displayed completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and conjures up images of tournaments, banquets and Arthurian chivalry.
Even standing among thousand-year-old ruins, it's easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battles long gone, almost hear the hooves on the cobblestones, and smell the growing fear in the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
As was typical of the time, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a targeted attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build it, the country was fairly peaceful and defence was only necessary against small bands of roaming marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which European nations strove to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to try to prevent one nation from becoming powerful. Therefore, national governments changed alliances to maintain the balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose main problem was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as the European powers could no longer use the pretext to fight religious wars. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last war labeled as a religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in an act of arson by Herostratus.
According to the story, his motivation was fame at any cost. The angry Ephesians declared that Herostratus' name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, which is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, asked to pay for a new construction of the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible and that you can still hit all the notes correctly. Also, try not to make unnecessarily large movements with your fingers.
So you tire as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to strike the keys with a lot of force to achieve extra volume, as is the case with the piano.
To increase the volume on the accordion, use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of community, identity, or conscious mindfulness related to an ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer strives for a direct experience, intuition or insight into the divine reality/deity or deities.
Adherents pursue certain lifestyles or practices designed to promote such experiences.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religious belief and worship in that it emphasizes the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness. This is especially true for those forms with a peaceful, insightful, blissful or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in the Punjab from a split from Hinduism.
Sikhs regard their faith as a religion independent of Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which means "way of the guru" in Punjabi. The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has assumed a meaning that is at the core of the Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). He was succeeded by another nine gurus.
In June 1956, however, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers protested food shortages and wage cuts, developed into a general protest against communism.
Although Krushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Vladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that included most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the Indus basin, from which its name is derived.
Although some scholars argue that the civilization should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, as it also existed in the basins of the now dried up Sarasvati River, while others refer to it as the Harappan civilization – after Harappa, the first of its sites, excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire helped in the development of medical advances.
Doctors were recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical force for use after battles.
The Roman surgeons knew several sedatives, including morphine from poppy seeds and scopolamine from the seeds of nightshade plants.
They mastered amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as pressure bandages and arterial clamps to curb blood flow.
For several centuries, the Roman Empire enabled great advances in medicine and shaped much of our knowledge today.
Pureland Origami is origami with the restriction that it may only be folded once. More complex folds such as reverse folding are not allowed and all folds have simple positions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who are inexperienced in folding or have limited motor skills.
Children develop racial awareness and stereotypes quite early on, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with an ethnic minority who are said not to do well in school tend to do poorly in school once they become aware of the stereotype associated with their ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have generated a lot of interest, especially in the education sector.
There are positive aspects of these sites, including the ability to easily set up a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos, and more.
This page can be easily accessed just by providing a web address. This makes it easy for students who may have trouble using the keyboard or spelling to remember and type them.
It can be customized to be easy to read, and also with as much or as little color as desired.
Attention deficit disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose classically descriptive symptom trio includes impulsivity, distractibility, and hyperactivity or excess energy."
"It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disability; it "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe as many as 2 million American children."
Children with ADHD have trouble focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things they enjoy, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoon series, or writing sentences without punctuation.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because they engage in "risky behavior, get into fights and challenge authority figures" to stimulate their brains because their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADHD affects relationships with peers because other children can't understand why they behave the way they do, why they spell that way, or why their maturity level is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed as described above, the baseline rate of knowledge acquisition also changed.
The approach to information gathering was different. The pressure was no longer in individual memory. Rather, the ability to remember texts became more important.
At its core, the Renaissance caused a significant change in the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, carry loads, or swing through trees.
The chimpanzee's hand and foot are of similar size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to load weight during ankle gait.
In humans, the hand is shorter than the foot, with the phalanges being straighter.
Fossilized hand bones, whose age is two to three million years, show this change in the specialization of the hand from means of transport to gripping tool.
Some people believe that the experience of many artificially created lucid dreams can often be very exhausting.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that lucid dreams lead to longer time intervals between REM phases.
With fewer REM phases per night, the condition where you experience real sleep and your body recovers becomes so rare that it becomes a problem.
This is just as tiring as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how many times per night your brain tries to dream lucidly.
Things didn't go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussar Regiment had captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
During a raid in the east of Bardia, the British seized the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshall Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and presumed successor to Mussolini, was accidentally killed by shelling his own troops while landing in Tobruk.
Modern fencing is practiced on many levels. From university students to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is primarily performed as a duel, in which one fencer fights with another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to get balls into holes.
During an ordinary round, eighteen holes are played, with players usually starting on the first hole of the course and ending on the eighteenth.
The player who needs the fewest strokes or swings with the racket to complete the course wins.
The match will be played on a lawn. The grass around the hole is mowed shorter and called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is the case when people go to a place that is very different from their normal everyday life for relaxation and pleasure.
Beaches, amusement parks and campsites are among the places most visited by leisure tourists.
If the goal of visiting a particular place is to learn its history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different attractions of a country or they can simply choose to focus on just one region.
The colonists had also called for reinforcements when they observed this activity.
Among the troops that strengthened the forward defensive positions were the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments of 200 men under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (who later both became generals).
Stark's men lined up along the fence at the north end of the colonists' position.
When the low tide created a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence northwards with a short stone wall that ended at a small beach at the edge of the water.
Gridley or Stark placed a pole about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one should fire before the regular soldiers had walked past it.
The American plan relied on carrying out coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder carried out a diversionary attack on the British garrison at Bordentown to block any further troops.
General James Ewing would lead 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, capture the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevent all enemy troops from escaping.
The main assault force of 2,400 men was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
By switching from quarter-mile to half-mile racing, pace is far less important and endurance is an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class 800 m runner running under two minutes must be fast, but in any case endurance must be trained.
Some cross-country running in winter combined with upper body training in the gym is the best preparation for the running season.
Good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance, but it significantly improves the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective drinking habits, and understanding the various aspects of taking supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of exercise.
Middle distance running is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment you need for this.
The products can be purchased on demand, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may think they prefer a product, even if it doesn't offer any real benefits.
The atom can be regarded as one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to a simplified Bohr model, consists of a central nucleus orbited by electrons, similar to how the Sun is orbited by planets – see Figure 1.1.
The atomic nucleus consists of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electric charge.
To check out the opera, you'll first need to get an overview of the setting to ensure your safety.
You need to pay attention to the position of the victim when approaching him, as well as any automatic warning signs.
If you hurt yourself while trying to help, you will only make things worse.
The study found that depression, anxiety, and disaster thinking in lumbago patients had an impact on the link between pain and activity restriction.
Only the effects of catastrophization, but not depression and anxiety, were a prerequisite for regular weekly structured sessions of physical activity.
Those who participated in regular activities needed more support in terms of negative pain perception when it came to distinguishing chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical exercise.
Vision, i.e. the ability to see, depends on sensory organs of the visual system or the eyes.
Eyes can be constructed in many ways, the complexity of which differs with the requirements of the life form.
The different constructions have different capabilities, are receptive to different wavelengths and have different visual acuity. In addition, they require different ways of processing what is recorded into a meaningful impression, and the number of eyes associated with the respective type of construction, which is necessary for optimal functioning, is different.
A population is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a specific geographical area.
If all individuals in a population are similar in terms of a particular phenotypic trait, then they are called monomorphic.
If the individuals exhibit different variations of a particular trait, then they are polymorphic.
Ant colonies also march and nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, migratory ants march at night and rest during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food has declined. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests, which are changed daily.
Each of these nomadic parades or marches lasts about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word 'cella', which means 'small space', and it was first coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are considered so fundamental and crucial in the study of life that they are often referred to as the building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow moving unhindered.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body to protect it from a potential threat.
Tornadoes hit a rather small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything in their path.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear boards from buildings and hurl cars through the air. The strongest 2 percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds that reach speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 MPH).
Humans have been producing and using magnifying lenses for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were built in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us and it is in the nature of cooperation that there is always more to gain from selfish behavior as long as the majority benefits.
It is hoped that most people realize that their long-term best option is to cooperate with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some people worry about what's out there. Some believe that aliens or other life forms could exist on other planets.
But if this ever happens, it will take a very long time until then. The stars are so widely scattered that even between "neighboring stars" there are trillions of kilometers.
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will stand on the top of an alien world wondering who their ancestors were?
Animals consist of numerous cells. They eat things and digest them inside. Most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (even if not all animals have one; Jellyfish, for example, do not have one).
Animals can be found everywhere on earth. They burrow through the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small space.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of smaller squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in cork under a microscope.
They looked like rooms. He was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and connections can pass from one state to another and not change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example. The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is gaseous, liquid or solid.
Although its physical state may change, the chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and influences everything we do, yet is difficult to understand.
Time has been explored for thousands of years by religious, philosophical and scientific thinkers.
We experience time as a sequence of events that run from the future through the present into the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.
One can mark the passage of time itself by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens regularly over and over again.
Computers are nowadays used to manipulate images and videos.
Sophisticated animations can be constructed on the computer and are increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded with the help of sophisticated computers to process sounds and mix them together.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was long thought that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maoris, who hunted giant birds called moa.
The theory then led to the idea that the Maoris migrated from Polynesia with a large fleet, taking away the Moriori from New Zealand and thus establishing an agriculture-based society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture there.
There was another tribe in the Chatham Islands. These were Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some skirmishes and in the end the Moriori were destroyed.
Individuals who had been involved for several decades helped us value our strengths and passions, while difficulties and even failures were honestly evaluated.
By listening to individuals sharing their personal, family, and organizational stories, we gained valuable insights into the past and some personalities who influenced the organization's culture, for better or worse.
While understanding one's own history does not require an understanding of culture, it at least helps people get a sense of where they stand in the organization's history.
As they evaluate the successes and notice the failures, individuals and all participants as a whole internalize the values, mission and driving forces of the organization more strongly.
In this case, the memory of previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes helped people to be open to change and a new direction of the parish.
Success stories like these reduced the fear of change while creating a positive attitude towards coming changes.
Convergent thought patterns are problem-solving methods that bring together different ideas or areas to find a solution.
In this way of thinking, the focus is on speed, logic and accuracy, also on identifying facts, reapplying existing techniques, gathering information.
The most important factor of this attitude is this: there is only one right answer. One thinks of only two possible answers, right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this mindset think logically, can memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
People are by far the most gifted way of reading other people's minds.
This means that we are able to correctly assess what other people perceive, intend to do, think, know or want.
In addition to these skills, it is crucial to understand the intentions of others. It allows us to eliminate possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you'd probably assume they're trying to steal a stranger's car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it had been his own car that he tried to break into.
The MR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (KMR), which was discovered in the thirties by Felix Bloch (at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as an aid to medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted that was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.
"In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first full-body MRI scanner, which he called the Invincible."
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and reaction to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and to control the pace of the teaching content.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints and the possibility to work at flexible times. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at any time.
Students can also ask questions to lecturers at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.
The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from the absolute. There is not only one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge offered.
Our current experience with the many television programmes dealing with do-it-yourself approaches, information sharing and learning underscores this observation.
So many of us catch ourselves watching a TV show that informs us about a process or experience, even though we will never participate in it or apply that knowledge.
We will never overtake a car, build a well in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor's house.
Thanks to underwater fibre optic cable connections to Europe and broadband satellites, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if you're staying in an inn or private apartment) probably have Wi-Fi or a PC connected to the internet. In addition, all settlements have an internet café or a place with publicly accessible Wi-Fi.
"As noted earlier, while the word 'Eskimo' is still acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many Arctic peoples outside the United States, particularly in Canada."
You may hear this word among the indigenous people of Greenland, but foreigners should avoid it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit) in Greenland.
Crime and resentment towards foreigners in general are virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in the cities there are no "problem areas".
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that the unprepared might encounter.
If you're visiting Greenland during a cold season (considering that the further north you travel, the colder it gets), it's imperative to bring clothing that is warm enough.
The very long summer days can lead to insufficient sleep and associated health problems.
Also watch out for the Nordic mosquitoes during the summer. Even if they do not transmit diseases, they are very annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is tied to being a world-class tourist attraction, it is still diversified.
The largest fields of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Its frequent depiction in music, movies, literature, and pop culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known around the world.
San Francisco has built an extensive tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the country's best places for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit includes a plane ride to Orlando International Airport, then a bus ride to a Disney hotel on the premises, then a week-long stay there without leaving the Disney site, and then the journey home.
"There are countless variations possible, but this is what most people mean when they talk about a 'trip to Disney World.'"
Many tickets sold online through auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are already partially used multi-day Parkhopper tickets.
This is very often the case, but is forbidden by Disney: The tickets are not transferable.
Camping below the rim in the Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit.
Licenses are limited to protect the canyon and are available from the first of the month, four months before the start month.
Thus, on January 1, a permit for the hinterland is available for any start date in May.
The space for the most popular areas, such as Bright Angel Campground next to Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by those requests that come in on the first day reservations are possible for them.
There are a limited number of permits reserved for occasional requests, first come, first-served.
Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the beauty of the region and get to places off the beaten track.
This can be done with careful planning in a normal car. However, all-wheel drive is strongly recommended, as many places can only be reached with all-wheel drive and a high wheelbase.
When planning, keep in mind that while southern Africa is stable, neighboring countries are not.
Requirements and costs for a visa are different with each country and depend on the country you are from.
Each country also has specific laws that dictate which items must be in the car for emergencies.
Victoria Falls is a town in the western part of Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The town is right next to the falls and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tourists, numerous options for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (November to March) the amount of water will be higher and the falls will be more dramatic.
You can expect to get wet when you cross the bridge or use the winding paths that run past the falls.
On the other hand, precisely because of the high volume of water, your view of the actual waterfall is obscured – by all the water!
Tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the valley. The tomb of the young king was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter in almost intact condition.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is hardly worth a visit, as it is much smaller and has few decorations.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage inflicted on the mummy during the removal attempts from the coffin will be disappointed, as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but were brought to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time should spend it elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. Perched on a hill, this temple was built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The somber atmosphere of the temple and the view over Tonle Sap Lake are worth climbing the hill.
A visit to the attraction can be easily combined with a boat trip on the lake.
The Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple. Therefore, don't forget to take your passport with you when you travel to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel's capital and largest city, but most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as Israel's capital.
The ancient city on the hills of Judea has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is considered sacred in the three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Given the religious significance of the city and especially because of the many sights within the Old City, Jerusalem is one of Israel's main tourist destinations.
Jerusalem offers many historical, archaeological and cultural sites along with dynamic and bustling shopping malls, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must be declared legal by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to ensure a regulated migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who hold a U.S. Green Card should visit an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of your trip. A return or onward ticket is required to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups. If you are traveling alone or just with a friend, then you should team up with others and try to start a group of four to six people to get a cheaper fare for the individual.
But you shouldn't worry about that, because tourists are often grouped together so that the vehicles get full.
This is apparently more of a trick to make people believe that they have to pay more.
High above the northern edge of Machu Picchu towers this steep mountain, which is often the backdrop of many photos of the ruins.
From the bottom it looks a bit daunting and it's a steep and difficult climb, but most reasonably fit individuals should be able to tackle it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the trail is provided with stone steps, and in the steeper sections steel cables form a supporting railing.
However, expect to be out of breath and be careful in the steeper sections, especially if it is wet, as it can quickly become dangerous there.
Near the summit is a tiny cave to cross, which is quite low and very narrow.
The best way to see the sights and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands is by boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships operate in the waters around the Galapagos Islands – ranging in size from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place well in advance (as boats are usually full during high season).
Make sure you book through an agent specializing in the Galapagos Islands who is knowledgeable about a wide range of vessels.
So you can be sure that the ship best suits your special wishes and/or restrictions.
Before the Spaniards reached Chile in the 16th century, the north of the country was under Inca rule, while the center and south of the country were inhabited by the native Araucanians (Mapuche).
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent Native American groups that were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until after Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, which left Spain without a functioning central government for several years), the final victory could not be achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a country in the Caribbean that includes the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is also home to the oldest European city in the Americas, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was originally inhabited by the Taíno and Caribs. The Caribs spoke Arawak and arrived there about 10,000 years BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of the European explorers, the Taino population had experienced a significant decline in population due to the Spanish conquistadors.
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed around 100,000 Taínos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. This complex was built as an atrium for a 17th-century convent, of which the Templo de San Diego is the only building that remains.
Now it serves as a central square where numerous events take place during the day and night.
There are numerous restaurants in the vicinity of the garden, where in the afternoons and evenings often free concerts are held in the central pavilion.
Callejon del Beso (Kiss Alley). Two balconies, which are only 69 cm apart, are the site of an old love story.
For some change, a few children will tell you about the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend getaway with kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.

CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of $30 or $10 for day passes. See their Corcovado page for details.
The Cook Islands are an island nation freely associated with New Zealand, and they are located in Polynesia in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometers of ocean surface.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as "Hawaii Down Under".
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without all the big tourist hotels and other buildings.
The Cook Islands have no cities, but consist of 15 different islands. The most important are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries, offering luxury guesthouses has now become a kind of art form.
At the higher end of the scale, of course, B&Bs compete for two main points: sleeping places and breakfast.
Consequently, in the best of these accommodations you can find the most opulent bedding, possibly a handmade duvet or an antique bedstead.
At breakfast there can be seasonal delicacies of the region or the special dish of the host.
The setting can be a historic old building with antique equipment, a beautifully landscaped area and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and embarking on a long journey has an intrinsic attraction due to its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you're probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Setting up a tent on private property or in a city of any size can quickly lead to unwanted reactions.
In short, using your own car is a great option for a road trip, but rather not for camping.
Camping with a car is a possibility, as long as you own a spacious minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon that has folding seats.
The heritage of some hotels dates back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, the time before the Second World War, the 19th or early 20th century.
In these hotels, the rich and famous of their time used to stay and enjoy good food and nightlife.
The antique furnishings, the absence of modern comforts and a certain elegance also make up its character.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes host heads of state and other dignitaries who are visiting.
Very wealthy travelers might opt for air travel around the world, alternating with visits to many of these hotels.
A so-called Hospitality Exchange Network is the organization that brings travelers together with locals in the cities they visit.
Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional checks.
A list of available accommodations is now either printed out or made available online. It sometimes includes recommendations and reports from other travelers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 because computer programmer Casey Fenton had found a cheap flight for a trip to Iceland, but no place to stay.
He sent emails to students at the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels cater primarily to young people – a typical guest is in his twenties – but you'll often find older travellers there as well.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow them to stay in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the Winter Olympics in 2022, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the indoor ice events.
Other ski events take place at Taizicheng Ski Resort in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival between late November and mid-May, which varies depending on each temple's annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the temple anniversary, the birthday of the supreme deity, or other important events related to the temple.
The temple festivals in Kerala with regular processions of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities are very interesting to watch,
A World's Fair (often called World Expo or simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries exhibit artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions to showcase global concerns or the culture and history of each country.
International horticultural exhibitions are special events where flower shows, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants are presented.
Although theoretically they can take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), in practice this is different.
These events usually last three to six months and are held in locations covering at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The normal 35 mm film (negatives measuring 36 x 24 mm) is the most common.
It can usually be refilled quite easily when you run out of it, and it has a resolution that is roughly equivalent to that of current digital SLR cameras.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more precisely, a 56 x 56 mm negative.
This results in a resolution almost four times higher than a 35 mm negative (3136 mm² compared to 864).
Wildlife is one of the most difficult subjects for a photographer. You need luck as well as patience, experience and good equipment for this type of photography.
Wildlife photography is often taken for granted, but as with other photography, a picture is worth a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires long telephoto lenses, although other lenses are required for subjects such as a flock of birds or a small creature.
Many exotic animals are difficult to spot and some parks have regulations for taking photos for commercial purposes.
Wildlife can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot, or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers.
Written words are also often easier to understand than spoken words. This is especially true for addresses, where clear pronunciation is often difficult.
Many entire nations are fluent in English, and in even more countries you can expect limited English skills, especially among younger people.
Imagine one person from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and one from Sydney sitting together eating at a Toronto restaurant.
They delight in stories told to each other from their hometowns, presented in their distinct accents and local jargons.
Buying food at the supermarket is usually the cheapest way to get full. Without cooking facilities, however, the selection is limited to ready-made dishes.
Supermarkets receive an increasing variety of ready meals. Some even offer microwaves and other methods of warming up the food.
In some countries or store types, there is at least one restaurant on site, which is often more casual and affordable.
Make copies of your policy and your insurer's contact details and carry them with you.
For consultations/authorizations and applications, they must provide the insurer's email address and international telephone numbers.
Keep another copy in your baggage and online (email to yourself with attachment or stored in the "cloud").
If you're travelling with a laptop or tablet, make a copy in memory or on your hard drive (which is available without internet).
Also give copies of the insurance/contact details to fellow travelers and relatives or friends back home who are willing to help.
Moose are not inherently aggressive, but defend themselves when they perceive a threat.
People who do not see the moose as a possible threat can get too close to it and put themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently and it is very important to know your limits.
Potential long-term health problems from excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger is increased by the consumption of illegally produced alcohol.
Illicit spirits can contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can lead to blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in other countries, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider getting an eye exam in your home country, especially if it's covered by insurance, and then redeem the prescription in another country.
High-quality brand frames available in such territories can have two problems – some may be fakes, the genuine, imported ones may be more expensive than in their own country.
Coffee is one of the world's most traded commodities and you can probably find many different varieties in your home region.
Nevertheless, there are many different ways to drink coffee around the world that you should experience.
Canyoning (also called canyoning) is about climbing into the bottom of a canyon that is either dry or full of water.
Elements of canyoning are swimming, climbing and jumping – but it has relatively low demands on training and physical condition for beginners (for example, compared to rock climbing, scuba diving and alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in nature, often on hiking trails.
Day hikes range from less than a mile to longer distances that can be covered in a single day.
A day hike on an easy route doesn't require much preparation and anyone reasonably fit can enjoy it.
Families with young children may need more preparation, but a day outdoors is easily doable even with babies and preschoolers.
There are almost 200 running tour organizations worldwide. Most of them work independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of sightrunning providers on four continents.
With roots in Barcelona's Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen's Running Copenhagen, it quickly grew through Running Tours Prague in Prague and others.
There are many things you need to consider before and during a trip.
Don't expect things to be exactly the same as "home" when traveling. Manners, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, standards, language, and so on will be different to some extent than where you live.
This is something to keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even dislike of local practices.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel consultant is usually a good choice for trips beyond the traveler's previous experience of nature, culture, language, or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to handle most regular bookings, many agents specialize in specific travel types, price ranges, or destinations.
It may make more sense to use a travel advisor who frequently books trips similar to yours.
Take a look at the trips that the travel agent advertises on the website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world cost-effectively out of necessity, because of your lifestyle, or as a challenge, there are a few ways to do it.
They basically fall into two categories: either you work while you travel, or you try to cut down on your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to reduce expenses to near zero, see Traveling on a Minimal Budget.
The advice assumes that travelers do not steal, trespass, engage in black market activities, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own benefit.
An immigration check point is usually the first stop when you get off a plane, ship or other vehicle.
On some cross-border trains, checks are carried out on the moving train and you should have a valid ID with you when boarding one of these trains.
On night trains, the passes can be collected by the conductor so that your sleep is not interrupted.
Registration is another necessity in the visa procedure. In some countries, you must report your presence and residential address to the local authorities.
This means, for example, filling out a form with the local police or presenting yourself to the immigration authorities.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels take care of the registration (don't forget to ask for it).
If necessary, only travellers who do not stay in tourist accommodation must register. However, this makes the law much less clear, so you should inform yourself before travelling.
Architecture deals with the planning and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a cleverly positioned window can prove beautiful.
Architecture largely overlaps with other disciplines, including urban planning, construction, decorative arts, interior design, and landscaping.
Considering how remote many of the pueblos are, you won't find any nightlife worth mentioning unless you travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and some of them invite big-name entertainers (mainly the big casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Caution: The small-town pubs in this area are not always suitable destinations for guests from outside.
On the one hand, northern New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcohol. In the vicinity of small-town bars, the concentration of drunk drivers is particularly high.
Unwanted murals or graffiti are known as graffiti.
Although far from being a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with teenagers destroying public and private property with spray paint.
"Nowadays, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events and 'legal' walls. In this context, graffiti paintings more often resemble works of art than illegible doodles. "
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it comes back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang.
Most boomerangs available in Australia don't actually return. Beginners should try not to throw in windy weather.
A hāngi dish is cooked in a hot hole in the ground.
The pit is heated with hot stones from a fire or in some places by geothermal heat, where the ground is naturally hot in places.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditional fried dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail owns two classes of commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also known as first class) and Metro (referred to as third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but slightly more expensive – although still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro cars. The MetroPlus cars are always located at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.
Carrying for others – Never lose sight of your luggage, especially when crossing international borders.
You could be used as a drug messenger without knowing it, which will bring you a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line, as drug sniffer dogs could be used at any time without notice.
In some countries, even for first-time offences, there are extremely draconian penalties; these may include prison sentences of more than 10 years or the death penalty.
Unattended bags are a target for thieves and can also attract the attention of authorities who fear bomb threats.
At home, you are most likely already immune to local germs because you are constantly exposed to them.
However, in other parts of the world where the bacteriological fauna is new to you, you are much more likely to encounter problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Hence the scourges of Delhi Belly, the Pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and her many friends.
Like breathing problems in cold climates, intestinal problems are quite common in hot climates. In most cases, they are very annoying, but rather harmless.
If you're traveling to a developing country – or a new part of the world – for the first time, don't underestimate how strong the culture shock can be.
Many stable, capable travelers have been overwhelmed by the otherness of travel in developing countries, where the many small cultural differences can quickly add up.
Especially in the first few days, consider taking advantage of Western-style hotels, food, and services to facilitate acclimatization.
Do not sleep on a mattress or mat on the floor in areas where you don't know the local wildlife.
If you're camping outdoors, consider bringing a folding bed or hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, etc.
Fill your home with a delicious coffee in the morning and some relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
If you're vacationing at home, you'll have time to have a good time and invest a few extra minutes to brew something special.
If you want a little more adventure, take the chance to make smoothies juicier or blend:
You might find a simple drink to prepare for breakfast when you're back in your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don't visit frequently.
For those who have little knowledge of medical jargon: The terms infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus, or other parasite.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are near an infected person.
Many governments require incoming visitors or departing residents in their countries to be vaccinated against a range of diseases.
These requirements often depend on which countries a holidaymaker has already visited or which he wants to visit.
One of Charlotte's, North Carolina's strengths is that it has a wealth of high-quality offerings for families.
Residents from other areas often cite family-friendliness as the main reason for their move, and visitors with children feel very comfortable in the city.
Over the past 20 years, the choice of kid-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are not usually used by families in Charlotte, although they can be useful in certain circumstances.
There is an additional charge for more than 2 passengers, which may make this choice more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, which surrounds the South Pole, is the coldest place on earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place in summer (Nov–Feb) and are mostly limited to the peninsula, islands and Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in the summer in about four dozen bases, mainly in these areas; a small number stay over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a lonely plateau covered with 2–3 km of ice.
Occasional specialized air tours lead inland, mountaineering or to the pole, where there is a large research station.
The South Pole Traverse (also called Highway) is a 1600 km long road from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
The road surface is levelled snow. Columns are filled with snow and marked with flags. The road can only be navigated by special tractors that pull sledges with fuel and supplies behind them.
These are not very manoeuvrable, so the road around the Transantarctic Mountains has to make a wide arc to reach the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, sidewalks (sidewalks) and especially steps.
You need at least shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are inadequate.
The profile should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough even at low temperatures.
Some boots have cleats and for slippery conditions there is additional equipment with cleats for the heels or heels and sole, which are suitable for most shoes and boots.
Heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or paths to improve grip.
Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess amount comes down as avalanches.
The problem is that snow sticks. Therefore, a trigger is needed for the snow to come down. Some falling snow can be the triggering event for the rest.
Sometimes the original trigger is the sun, which warms the snow, sometimes it is further snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human being.
A tornado is a swirling column of very low pressure air that sucks in and causes the surrounding air to rise.
They produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air and swirl them around.
They start as funnels that descend from storm clouds and become "tornadoes" when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN (virtual private network) providers are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofilters.
They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: they redirect all Internet traffic, not just http.
Typically, they offer higher bandwidths and better performance quality. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
"The media outlets regularly lie about the intent behind it, claiming that it serves to 'prevent piracy.'"
Rather, the region code has no effect at all on piracy. The bit-by-bit copy of a CD runs smoothly on all devices running the original.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; It's all about profit.
Since the calls are routed over the Internet, you do not have to use a telephone company located at your place of residence or travel.
It is also not necessary for you to receive a local number from the municipality where you live. You can get an internet connection via satellite in the wilderness of Chicken in Alaska and dial a number that pretends to be in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you have to buy a global number separately that you can be called to via the public telephone network. Where the number comes from makes a difference to the people who call you.
Real-time text translation apps – apps capable of automatically translating entire sections of a text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate foreign-language texts on signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smartphone at these objects.
Translation engines have dramatically improved your performance and now often provide more or less correct translations (and less often gibberish). Nevertheless, caution is advised, as they may still get everything wrong.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the data of the desired language.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone is probably the easiest and most practical way to find your way outside your home country.
This can save money because you don't have to buy new maps for a navigation device or a standalone navigation device, or rent one from a car rental company.
Your performance might be limited or unavailable if you don't have a data connection with your phone or if it's out of range.
Each corner store is filled with a bewildering selection of prepaid phone cards that can be used for pay phones or regular phones.
While you can call anywhere with most cards, some only serve to provide advantageous rates for certain groups of countries.
These services are often accessible via a free phone number, which can be called from most phones without charges.
The rules for normal photography also apply to video recordings, perhaps even more so.
If it is not allowed to photograph something, then you should not even think about taking a video of it.
If you use a drone, you should check well in advance what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in their area.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly with the airline without prior search and price comparison.
Sometimes the same flight can have extremely different prices on different booking sites. Therefore, it pays to compare search results before booking and also look on the airline's website itself.
Even if you do not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, entering as an international student usually requires a longer stay than if you only enter as an ordinary tourist.
In general, a long-term stay in a foreign country requires the prior application for a visa.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a written offer from the institution where you want to study and proof that you have the means to stay afloat for at least your first year of study.
Find out about the individual requirements at the institution as well as at the immigration office of the country in which you want to study.
Unless you are a diplomat, when working abroad, you will generally need to file your income tax return in your country of residence.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries and tax rates and classes vary greatly from one country to another.
In some federally organized countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied at both the federal and local levels. Therefore, tax rates and groups may differ from region to region.
While there is usually no immigration control upon arrival in your home country or this is just a formality, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can and can't introduce, and state anything beyond the legal limits.
The easiest way to get started with travel literature is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website.
Once you get used to formatting and editing online, you may be able to create your own website later.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to make a difference, but it's not just about giving.
Living in a foreign country and volunteering is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, see things from a different perspective, and even learn new skills.
It can also be a good way to increase your budget to make a longer stay possible, as many volunteer services include board and lodging and some pay a small fee.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used today. Special permission may be required for use. Obtaining these is not always easy.
The White Sea-Baltic waterway connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so that a journey from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible.
Rest assured that everything will be pretty clear once you reach the docks. You will meet other boat hitchhikers who will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, you will offer your help, walk around the docks, approach people cleaning their yachts, make contact with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone knows you and you will get tips on which boat someone is looking for.
You should carefully choose your frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
Even though you might think that you should instinctively take the airline you fly with the most, you should note that the benefits offered are often different. Frequent flyer points could be awarded more generously with another airline on the same connection.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their flight connections to Africa and offer connections to numerous major African cities at low prices compared to European airlines.
As of 2014, Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check out how your total travel costs to Africa compare to the cost of a trip around the world.
Don't forget the extra costs for additional visas, departure fees, means of transport on land, etc. for all the places outside of Africa.
If you want to completely circumnavigate the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is very limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not offer any of these connections).
However, Star Alliance covers everything outside the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight isn't the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and South American West Coast. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis.
With Armenian support, a new republic was established. However, it does not officially recognize any established country – not even Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal Belt (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district that encompasses Amsterdam's city centre.
The entire neighborhood has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and its property values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, terraces have been carefully built into the rugged, sloping terrain, up to the cliffs that lie directly above the sea.
Part of its charm is that there are no visible commercial buildings. The villages are connected by paths, trains and boats and no cars come in from outside.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are slightly different from the variants spoken in France, but are similar enough to be understood by both sides.
In particular, the method of counting in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some minor peculiarities that differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words also differs slightly.
Nevertheless, it can be assumed that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have learned standard French at school and understand you, even if you use the normal French counting system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that signals a "hello."
"However, in Malaysia, or at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means 'come here', similar to curving the index finger towards the body, a gesture used in some Western countries and should only be used for this purpose."
Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may misinterpret a goodbye wave with the palm facing the waving person (rather than the person being waved) as a gesture of coming back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise find it difficult to communicate.
They differ from the so-called lingua francae, natural or organic languages, which for various reasons become prevalent as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can experience mirages that give the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler tracks the mirage, wasting valuable energy and his remaining water.
Even in the hottest deserts, it can get extremely cold at night. Without warm clothing, hypothermia is a real danger.
Especially in summer, they have to beware of mosquitoes if they want to migrate through the rainforest.
Even if you're driving through the subtropical rainforest, a few seconds with the doors open when boarding is enough to take mosquitoes into the car.
Avian flu, or rather avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
There are fewer than a thousand documented cases in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
Most cases involved people working with poultry, but there is also some risk for birdwatchers.
Steep fjords and valleys that unexpectedly merge into a high, more or less flat plateau are typical of Norway.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde", which means a wide, open, treeless space, a boundless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder it is usually called "hei", meaning a treeless moorland, often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain. This creates cracks and crevices that can be hidden by snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks can close.
At the edge of glaciers, huge blocks break off, fall down, and possibly jump or roll farther away from the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and magic in winter. Numerous mountain stations have lots of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer death rates with a slight discount on last-minute travel to a funeral.
Among the airlines that offer these are Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the USA or Canada, and Westjet.
In any case, you must book by telephone through the airline.
