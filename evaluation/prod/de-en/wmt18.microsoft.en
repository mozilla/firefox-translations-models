Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A lunatic asylum, where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where digging is now being done for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Allotment gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich brings exciting stories to light.
It is annoying when maps are not up-to-date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road knows this.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but therefore very revealing.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey in Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the War of the Second Coalition with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the Treaty of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison past/present is most impressive using the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
Around 1856, the houses of Untersendling were concentrated along today's Plinganserstraße, which was not named until 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered parcels from the so-called "original recording", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but allotment gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the venue of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people with delusions were once locked up.
In 1858/59 the Munich district lunatic asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded there.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and stopped, for example, the chaining of the so-called lunatics.
In addition, he forbade the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who dealt with the institution for an exhibition.
Initially, there was room for 280 patients, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, even this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district insane asylum in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munich's Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
To the west is the football pitch of TSV München Ost, to the east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's home "Casa Don Bosco" was built - architecturally based on the original building of the lunatic asylum, which had been destroyed in bombing raids during the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as "Haupt Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city center in December 1944.
One big one has remained to this day - at Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where the preparatory work and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn trunk line will take place on 5 April 2017.
With the slider, the old map of Munich can be compared with the aerial photo of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of People of Color has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled to go into effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, given that a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here,"  says the group's opinion.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of the color of their skin, they are beaten up or killed," Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven't heard before."
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling across the state and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bail money or letting relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, which rank the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Electric fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach electric fence project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, where he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, cares for 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, "Black Forest milk" is the marketing channel for the milk of his cows without alternative, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as "fundamentally important".
I cannot operate profitably on such steep surfaces.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much has to be worked with the brushcutter.
"We are struggling with the conditions and the topography here," Schwendemann emphasized.
In 2003, he took over his parents' business and manages it without chemical pesticides and fertilisers, even though he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At costs of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be delayed for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to take their business further," the mayor emphasized.
Farmers are often criticised for the support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in via the electric fence subsidy.
The open area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500, half was funded by Leader, a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left farmers with EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it does not work".
For Peter Weiss it was also clear: "The best food is produced here".
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Management Directive (LPR) enables state funding for pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding scheme designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable by tractors (slope gradient over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence, is currently running.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump's White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate them as much as any other, hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.
But he attacked its significance, and especially the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller insulted Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your afflicted masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."
There has never been a time when the "miserable waste" was better visible on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's US.
This conflict over the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus—and her friends, who worked to place her words at the grassroots level after her death—knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The poem's association with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing had long wanted to change it back.
The great screamer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather was an early neoconservative bringing the American flame to the deranged world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And, of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not intended to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the Great Britain team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll keep it going until we figure it out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m course, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the team as team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought to the table was great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" to have 16 Scots in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup to date was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads on this path and set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me," she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'll get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand heating up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the criticism, sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we will be led like sheep to slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's associates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with "So what?"
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it is important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the management of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his constituents and playfully debuting his hairless head on his site after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's side — which is a public forum labeled official and employees paid with public tax dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people wielding the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in the comments section of The Post.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are more likely to be disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for berating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers lashed out at his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that struck down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement, and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led to the finals at Archerfield Links next door last year before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see it achieving its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job in determining this location.
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken off the programme the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the Helensburgh man.
"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played solid golf.
I'm happy with how it went so far."
With the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to secondhand smoke.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is reasonably in time", according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is a lot hidden underground that is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato — locally called "nota" — directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and devoured.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It's a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote through a public hand-raising before occupying forces.
An existing movement calling for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is barren. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs that have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and light skirt.
"We used to only have leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything," according to a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities committed the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture — rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report — and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of casualties because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the native Papuans - the mommy-mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address inequalities and rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts – including Paniai – on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You said.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offence at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating birdsong - by Papua's me Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali's Kego Koto district, saw the impending danger and called for calm, urging the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians has only one name, told TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papuan police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta 'filtered' until the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through," he said.
Then Wiranto backed down when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papuan Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papuan rights by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never reappear.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and leafy greens.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potato at a time.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system in place, and there is a free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuas, see their vote for Jokowi as a "debt" that he must repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried in a compound just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says, bowing his head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire broke through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the skyscraper in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire and cooled the building around 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT).
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from cladding, exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believed the system of insulation and cladding panels at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal to play Davis Cup singles on only two winning sets, which is revolutionary for this sport, was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but therefore highly appreciated five-set classics remain in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, narrowly missing ITF president David Haggerty's target.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
They will continue to work on improving the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final at a neutral location had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: In the future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round the following year.
In order to reduce costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training grounds, etc. will be eased and the players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items on the plane, a survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had belatedly discovered that they had traveled mistakenly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many did it intentionally.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband — knowingly or unknowingly — through security were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that TSA policies are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders
Electric jack-of-all-trades Elon Musk likes to brag about the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has concealed the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed another, less glamorous number for the first time when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass-market Model 3.
Musk had often advertised in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will refund the 1000 euros (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
There are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it should be - all models together - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never tested in practice production lines at maximum capacity without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't stop dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt pulls out over delaying Obama era rules to cut emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government environmental agencies than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to blocking or delaying regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his about-face on ozone standards simply strengthened the EPA's willingness to work with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be sued by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously."
Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt will at some point use his "power of delay and any other legally available powers" to ensure that the regulations are "based on sound policy and the best information available."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal — following our lawsuits — is a major gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is formed when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's troubling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump administration's ideological crusade of currying favor with polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade will be held on the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 pm.
Because of its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius-Anlage is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Deeds: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the hill with the parish church of Tumlingen including the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately farm on the Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
So there were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, in addition to the lower village and the upper village, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built, equipped and staffed a church with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this own church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke up at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Hilarius Cemetery in Tumlingen also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuskirche demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf, which still exists today, has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnern" succeed Dieter Dockhorn in maintaining the Hilarius complex.
As organizers, the Friends and Sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16, in the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.
This will be designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Village leader Hartmut Romann gives the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 pm.
Doors open at 3:30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade, a drink will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers emphasize the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to the preservation of the homeland, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines examined
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the district administrator.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was carried out unlawfully.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time there was only a wind power concentration zone in Viersen on the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagus" of the landscape.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette due to an amendment to the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim wehrt sich".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law."
The circle acknowledges receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received since last week in the district of Viersen," said a spokesman.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are unlikely to lead to the proceedings being stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association "Boisheim defends itself" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines, each 200 meters high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen has an indirect stake, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirements of around 11,400 households should be covered - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all Viersen households.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 o'clock on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car as part of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an escort the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and retailers plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping possibilities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the city center for a shopping spree.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city has in store apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center should invite you to "midnight shopping".
The campaign is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
According to Christian König, commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend are in preparation.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The trade association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the "Attractive city centre" project.
This includes new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest including Sunday shopping, discussions with all tradespeople and innkeepers to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be tapped or recovered.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - up to landlords, the companies of the whole city and associations.
It is important to overcome the lethargy with a network, which has spread in part, König had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating for the first time in Germany's third "Heimat-Shoppen" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The campaign under the auspices of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his buying behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire brigade, an injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initially missing person was later also recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico over payment of border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were released by the Washington Post.
On Jan. 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena, Trump called on Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. He reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the US and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a deal for the U.S. to take on refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "lousy," and "stupid," and that insisting on the deal brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "fool" after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Repeat Racist Lynching as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long drag on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates hovered in fear.
"We want this n ---- Roger!" the man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams broke the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, this horrific scene, played out on July 22, is just a re-enactment.
But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience lets out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples—Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey—were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a stain of dirt on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A coroner lays a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for lynching has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote in the summer primary campaign for the first time.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight — allegedly over a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who were not only involved in the murders, removing evidence and covering up the identities of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is going to happen to you.'
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene directed the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would have you believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors—a dozen whites and the rest blacks—crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm yelling at Hester and harassing him, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, --- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he' back then."
"Yes," quipped one of the other black actors.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'"
And that's exactly where the energy in the room shifts, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning eulogy "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks at every other word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song fade away, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat at their heads, register the fake blood and silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy murmurs, as if to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his teammates and then breaks down crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance had left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... to come from people who look like yourself and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning next year's performance.
"The re-enactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we've endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it."
"Twilight of the Gods" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental oeuvre, director Frank Castorf also focuses on a colourfully frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the remnants of the Wall and kebab shop in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Parked in front of it is an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his "Ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and gives the riot clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, who is surrounded by the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with loud applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows modestly and forms his hands into a Merkel diamond, are celebrated stormily.
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was eagerly awaited.
While in 2013 he had to endure a blaring whistling concert, five years later there was great jubilation, in which the occasional "boo" calls were drowned.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been pleased about this.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "Ring" in a certain way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also an understanding of his point of view had grown.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked at the school in the open full day.
What is your experience with this?
Menge: It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late-appointed volunteer.
How come?
Quantity: I graduated from high school.
And then, let's say, successfully dropped out of a civil engineering degree.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing.
Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on site, in the focal point perhaps.
And was it so?
Quantity: I collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dually, probably do a social worker training at the youth welfare office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from old people's homes to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, this was exactly the right thing that appealed to me.
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from studying civil engineering?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head, each of whom has a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of contact?
Menge: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's life.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome pressures facing the company.
The job cuts, which CEO John Fallon announced mostly for late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of his previous restructuring, which has already seen 4,000 job losses.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting program a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after gaining 1 percent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month — more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosive device carried by people."
The statement states that all injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombardment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant assault since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation by Obama's administration, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions. This came a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to move forward with the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015," saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's intention to delay ozone regulations — which would measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards — by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump says is designed to boost economic growth.
However, the effort has triggered a backlash from Democrats and conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Local council wants common room
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior citizens' residence.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take some time until the area previously owned by the parish is owned by the municipality, there is no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be carried out by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common room.
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to accommodate the municipality.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have in mind to provide such a common room not only as a meeting place for the residents of senior-friendly living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitting café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was already pre-decided last autumn by providing funds for the current budget, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common room would be eligible for funding with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw clubs between his legs in this respect, the proposed resolution provides for the statement that both gable roof - which is based on the surrounding buildings - and monopitch roof - which reduces the eaves height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Wilfried Sohmer is not the only one who thinks that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: He passes the committee unanimously.
It's not so easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which one does not really make progress, but now leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I have a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind this a hidden subsidy to wealthy people or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a subsidy, but get a real, in case of doubt marketable value, is the counter-speech.
Staiger's motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly finds three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist is thrown onto road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police announced, had been the 82-year-old Langenfelder at 12.20 pm with his bicycle on the bike path of the road Schwarzer Weg coming from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A female driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old woman from Hilden.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital by ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich have to do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first competitive game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winners.
The personnel concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 / ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winners Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Munich Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six friendly matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we are not in the best physical shape," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It hasn't been good lately."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official competitive game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel between the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the Harz Mountains
In the Harz Mountains, Germany's first "Star Trail" is to be created.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many Harz visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
Eligible would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the Star Trail will be expanded step by step.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, even though it is much further away.
It also conveys in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy are clearly visible to the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetenweg - in the university city.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet trail with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto, which has been degraded to a dwarf planet at the end - are set up exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planet trail is a good four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to stage the most thrilling boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory over former Four Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Showtime Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect scale."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up [to 140 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that tall.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later openly expressing himself to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter" and he might take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia, saying that he thinks the three-way champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus is to show punching power, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Four injured after tyre burst
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were injured, some seriously.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle around 4:30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, probably after a tire burst.
The car slid to the right into the embankment, where it rolled over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident, some seriously.
During the first aid of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be directed past the scene of the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Triple chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 draw at the season opener against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Aue brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result as well, had it not been for the two goals conceded in the 2-2 draw against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," said the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick do not want to catch the fortunes anymore.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better with the three-man chain than with the four-man chain, even after the experience in preparation.
"I don't know yet how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players in the back three in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite, however, is that we harmonize even better and that we do not afford so many playback errors in the structure."
Of course, Hoffmann also travels to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw, I don't know.
The performance could be okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we are with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"I judge the start of the season only after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel, and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they would not have a difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in their bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they currently stand," says the Fortuna central defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a slight favorite on Sunday in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the ambition to finish in the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record with only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They are supposed to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under the age of 18."
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "suggest the person being screened was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that he would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's about 10 percent."
Right on schedule
Work on the three bridges on Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very well on time, things are going great," says Reinhold Leicht, site manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Freiburg Regional Council.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach, which were in need of renovation.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is getting old.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 meters long, respectively.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20-meter-wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
The pedestrian path will then run along this.
The special thing about it is that these are prefabricated parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach required special sensitivity.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by flyers.
In addition, fish and crabs first had to be fished out.
For the bridges between the building yard and the collection pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700,000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the state.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest over German potato salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Linke) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully flies the flag on this day, because the AfD invites to the "big election campaign kick-off" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell, according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD members, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colourful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that presents itself.
And Christa Karoli, chairwoman of Forum Eine Welt and one of the main organisers, is really pleased: "It's great how many people came together here".
There is music and lots of food, including a "quintessentially German potato salad, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence especially at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to hold such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a rejection there because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So now the roundabout, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
With a view to the event on the Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
And it does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall, waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but even there is shortly after 21 o'clock cleaning up announced.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
There will be a re-hearing with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 pm in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is principal trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is principal trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both share the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free playing mix to form a fascinating work of art.
This core piece of the program was premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart says openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
Probably the most famous relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress told Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?"
After their breakup, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and sincerely believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
According to "Bang Showbiz", she particularly suffered from this during her school days, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I looked like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'"
Especially to the public, she does not like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public."
West Virginia Governor Announces He Is Changing Parties
. West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would switch parties.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... Today, as a West Virginia resident, I'm not going to tell you, I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play a different game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's change of party is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is top-to-bottom without leadership and unable to deliver a positive, unifying message," RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
The global head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all the athletes who had gold and silver medals snatched away in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very frank response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it's been a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia has yet to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still free, he told reporters in London after speaking at the IAAF Council.
Funeral for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar in northern Hesse, around 1,000 people remembered the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two pilots who died as "experts in their field".
"We bow before this supreme sacrifice, which they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she declared.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old staff captain from northern Hesse were killed on Wednesday a week ago in Mali, West Africa.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to St. Peter's Cathedral in Fritzlar on Thursday, accompanied by a Bundeswehr wake.
At noon, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral service began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a screen.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and operationally experienced.
The staff captain had helped to build up the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated by only two states," she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik does not want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement continued.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
However, he had no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe to the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
He retired in 2016 and also relinquished the title "Prince Consort".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
Where the final resting place of the 83-Year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
On the Thames he worked in the French embassy.
While his future wife always received the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën over Volvo, tennis over football.
Even for the Gauloises, whom I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation in this country of being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
Those were two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants quick new elections
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favor of a quick new election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil spoke out on Friday for the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them.
This would give the CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decides to dissolve itself as quickly as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further course of action.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament withdraws its confidence in the prime minister and elects a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally sound manner," said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed calmly when they have been examined in a legally reasonable manner."
Thümler called Twesten's step "a bit strange".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the renegade MP to return her parliamentary mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she received via the Green state list, with immediate effect," said state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Anja Piel, leader of the Greens, said: "We deeply regret Elke Twesten's decision."
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the defection of Lower Saxony's Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behavior of the former Green deputies in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of Red-Green," wrote the federal head of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the state parliament.
Twesten's exit costs Red-Green a majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician put "in her wounded vanity and frustration her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty game of intrigue and tries to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his deputies to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force ahead of the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Interview with the Minister of Agriculture - How do we protect ourselves from poisoned eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers questions in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my House immediately intervened and has been in close contact with the authorities of the Länder since it became known that Germany was affected.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Just like the manufacturers, retailers must ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg, they are not marketable.
However, uncontaminated eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it is not the companies' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they must expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or is there also a lack of conclusive responsibility?
After all, it was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor's offices in cases in which criminal offences may be committed are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete clarification.
Is regular alarmism about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated product has put manufacturers, retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be worked on consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs, will not interfere with Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the governing body that oversees European play has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules put in place by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen up the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – was to become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell out of favor from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can spread the amount for invoicing over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be shown in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions, along with Manchester City-owned Abu Dhabi.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million – and it was ordered that team members for the 2014/15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit its financial regulator by inflating their revenues through companies linked to a club's owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG's payments to Neymar could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation told Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once a country has a club, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: The airline is putting the order out to tender again.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokeswoman.
Every year, flight attendants distribute around 17 million small red-and-white chocolate bars weighing 14 grams to passengers before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Nordwestschweiz" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is always the advertising effect: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are treated to treats from Confiserie Sprüngli, passengers snack on Lindt chocolate in Business Class and chocolate from Chocolat Frey in Economy Class.
Swiss also distributes chocolate from Chocolat Frey on short-haul routes, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Olympic discus champion Robert Harting reaches World Championship final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Championship elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia goes niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic for the glory days of the characters of the '80s, for the '90s grunge era (when thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for itself — that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it's both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it included an original story for a talking can of vegetables voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody is more scattered, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the digressions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's moustache from "Singles," whose former Big Man on Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," the final scene of which will show the gang attending the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, evokes a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its east-versus-west wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous voice actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of 'find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama — involving a murderer wearing a Reagan mask — that it often plays like one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a shorter length, could deliver its agitprop satire better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make anything fodder for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officers secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
In simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.
The two will therefore probably be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor's offices in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil criminal investigation department had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations focused primarily on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is also likely to go to the gang's account.
Weise complains about large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This sometimes leads to serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "sometimes serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register includes ten million people with foreign citizenship, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "from people who have long since ceased to be alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."
"Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such incorrect assignments led "to a distorted debate about how to deal with those obliged to leave the country," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy if they have entered from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU country they reach first.
If a migrant travels on to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As justification, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy had given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic policy spokeswoman of the Left Party in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with reception conditions that violate human rights and endanger the well-being of the child."
Second-best result achieved
The blood donation service has already made a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available to other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his meanwhile 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipal council.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even altruistically," emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, head of the district emergency services of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is broken down into its components.
For example, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, we achieved the second-best result with 114 donors," said the GRC district readiness leader.
Apparently, the change to the Theaterhaus a few years ago had led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were each awarded for 50 blood donations.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger recorded half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times 500 milliliters of their lifeblood.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it maintains interest rates on family incomes amid mounting pressures.
Policymakers at the bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressures on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be necessary over the next few years to curb Brexit-fueled inflation, and she said borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this scheme - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are in line with the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of a rate hike and second-quarter GDP rose to 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases, as the tightening gets worse before improving.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the collapse in income over the next few years, but she added that wages will recover "significantly" by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August, following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's last ruling on interest rates, calls for a rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and it would pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun relative to its 2% target was "wholly" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look noisily for deals and end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and take out new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a battle in High Court against funding of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the Health Service via an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, with more clinics to follow in October before it will be rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is just enough medication in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and those with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify eligible participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of how it is targeted, uptaken and implemented at scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overhaul the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of sustained progress in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now must be to ensure that the trial is carried out quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people living with HIV."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This trial brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out across the country as soon as possible to protect individuals who are infected with HIV and that it will help us get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this flat in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first viewing, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with an intricate layout – you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom – Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To that end, she commissioned Notting Hill-based Erfan Azadi's architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the specification.
"The steel mill is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend down.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but about laying the steel so that it was the right height for the function at the top or bottom."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two full-height rooms on top of each other – with plenty of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space, and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you're going to sell the floor space — or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and do a calculation based on soil size."
Here they managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that through good design and increased square footage, an apartment can transform from something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave them.
Brothers fight over a $500 million real estate empire
Four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. He has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court record states that this means Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a pain point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - which Colin, Paul claims, has excluded him from.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the top priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and deli from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a young kid (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "became bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied via text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in hopes of keeping the chief on a more steady course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day on the job, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information falling into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information should flow about him — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he got good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades — and now that he's in the White House, his television commercials are still going strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from jobs that needed to be convinced," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes steady praise."
Ok.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't know — that Trump's tweets would have been even more explosive without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico, preoccupied with this story, reported in May on the advisers' penchant for providing dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is fixated on finding out where they came from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered concrete evidence, or that he has made false allegations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted felons are naturally not known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives hide at holiday destinations, Europol said.
They have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
The website www.eumostwanted has been around since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online wanted could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of information after the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a moat and return to the 'millionaire's series'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again at loggerheads with some determined travellers who have negotiated a ditch dug by the community to reclaim a field outside their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull street called the "Millionaires Row."
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters with them after being thrown out only in May, but were not deterred by a trench dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have pressed the council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can't even stop it."
One resident, who asked not to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travellers only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorised warehouse in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case."
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the visitor's tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing number of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the municipal council at the time.
But above all, Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke even then of serious interested parties in the house.
He was proved right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star-plus hotel again under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Their names are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, rubble containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do between now and March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully citizen-oriented", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities.
They do not want to position themselves on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to position itself broadly, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
When asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself exactly.
Just under a million euros, he calculates.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought into shape, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will be created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US special investigator appoints grand jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel had begun work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper interpreted the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took a closer look at Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump had personally moved to the center and was investigating the allegation of whether the President may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main role of grand juries is to review available evidence in potential crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
In most cases, they are called in when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel may also be called in by the public prosecutor's office to summon people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also present at the meeting.
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that the appointment shows that Mueller will not be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be called in at the end to decide whether to bring charges.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total fabrication," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he was unaware of the appointment of a grand jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that expedite the work of the special counsel in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president would not be investigated.
There was no reason to believe that anything had changed, the statement said.
Mueller had been used but only after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, allegations against Trump had become loud, he had wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special counsel of Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the urging of the president.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday that would make it harder to fire the special counsel.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has broken away from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and is 5800 square kilometers in size, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
It does not pose a danger to humans.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-off of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken off colossus was previously part of the Larsen C Ice Shelf.
Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it does now.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels, as they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI, the Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the furthest retreat since records began," he confirmed.
It is controversial among scientists whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the collapse of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have disintegrated in recent decades.
This long corner of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants in-house tariff for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU is calling for resignation from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district council waved through 41 new administrative positions.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have completed their first day at work.
The apprenticeships at the district are obviously very popular.
Around 620 applications were received for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the district still lacks personnel to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 vacancies in the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as members of the general administration are sought.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the district council together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should "develop a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a veritable "competition between public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
So it's high time to act so that more positions don't remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU parliamentary group, goes with his party even beyond the joint motion.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district council when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cap and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities to be examined that would make it possible to leave the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should strive for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities belonging to the district," says Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the collective bargaining regulations for the public service actually provide.
The salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money are only possible if you change to a higher level, which is based on years of work.
But the tasks of the district have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, District Administrator Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy sharpens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they abide by new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German charity Jugend Rettet because its crew had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been operating for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can assess all the allegations that are currently being made only after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew takes rubber dinghy migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board to supervise their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "substantial changes or obstructions" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to St. Michael's Chapel above Deidesheim.
This was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saltworks and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint after viewpoint lined up, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also visited.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - athletically and culturally.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of fighting their way across the stadium lawn in sweaty weather?
The fact is: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
It all started in 2015 with VfL Wolfsburg, followed later by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that a number of clubs will climb onto this bandwagon".
Next weekend, the world football association FIFA is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, so that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-athletes under contract, you could be present online far more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What is it exactly?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought out on a competitive level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea certainly takes some getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction ability are required.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacks the structures of classic sport.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players travel internationally, it's like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were generated in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little.
However, e-sports is "not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further ahead.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a teaching subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, first-division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"Compared to other European countries, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB chairman Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia and transfiguring the old times is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays as it always was."
Goodbye poison eggs - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil should be taken on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of lyrics urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent homicide of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands and eyes downwards when she was convicted.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regretted."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, which said that "there is not a day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"Not having that single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention from Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case has divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lame
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern believes that the Confederations Cup winner will have a great season - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different in his seat in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw that immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But since there was of course no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Neuer to be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he put the bandage assigned to him on his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confederations Cup winner afterwards, after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli.
But Kimmich could also interpret the sign from the coach in this way.
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as captain in the C-Elf consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come back from vacation, but him.
You prefer to distribute sweets to those you trust a lot, whom you want to keep happy.
So whoever has been chosen to take up the inheritance of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old raced across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And in general, Kimmich seemed in this starting line-up like the one who can take the helm best.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unrehearsed troops.
He had an eye for the big picture, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal by covering up his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches with the hell out of it to build on the achievements of the Asia trip (worked only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not attracting negative attention in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
At least that worked out quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently.
The well-known Napoli storm often had a hard time, and Süle also tried a few times successfully in the build-up.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we had hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance on his debut.
Game shift, change of tempo: "I was also brought in for this style".
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new signings was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two, but certainly six or seven interviews in the catacombs.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "I have already noticed what is going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn't have to teach the newcomers that anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer reported shortly before the game via Twitter and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is quasi club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and cheers with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern Dusel.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Business praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the state and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time rebuke the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, all of which Lemke has blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: closing the gap on Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning approval procedure, by 2021, the building right should stand.
A role in the plans of the state also plays the western bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) is striving for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been sinking for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master craftsman bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A bonus of 1000 euros is planned for the passed master craftsman's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master craftsman training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
In the case of the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the state lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing plans to hire at the State Office for Mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, deputy chairman of the CDU parliamentary group, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the state is investing more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept from the state on how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The broadband expansion in the country to date is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies rated the network supply in an IHK survey with only a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stalled internet connections and drops.
Former Economics Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green faction left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she vacated the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities — including Munich, where BMW is based — to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which allowed the use of so-called defeat devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but drive back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in engine development at Audi was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This is the message the raft sent on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that visitors to the Isar also participate, a raft will sail through Munich tomorrow, Saturday, with a special message.
If you are drawn to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information banner.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The prelude to a public relations campaign to appeal to visitors to the Isar.
With the motto "True love is..." is intended to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection.
Already last summer the raft sailed over the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's bulbous noses and laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, the bulbous noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at the age of 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laughter, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born in Buenos Aires on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In the first years as an artist, he made a living as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table in the early morning, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, soft toys and watches, his funny figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For the past six years, he has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a centipede as an antagonist.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to hit the big screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird to me," Mordillo says.
The screenplay is not written by him.
That's why he relies more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits leafhoppers, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts not only for holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened ones.
So we have fewer essential oil parts."
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Shopkeepers, guilds, traders, vagabonds or a Landsknechtslager should be experienced on these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for covering the recent chaos in Sinaloa State caused by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, to the office, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column – no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as corpses pile up across the country, more and more journalists are on the scene: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle journalists' cases, it has opened only two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers are rarely brought to justice by journalists.
In Riodoce's case, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kingpins that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to form Riodoce and sold $50 in holdings.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for its bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by a publication where they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after founding Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award for his courage in prosecuting the Mexican drug story wherever it took him.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to go on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid one.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths... Why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs while staying alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – nor do they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for safety training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were contracted by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountains, where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels for most of the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column to be the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim build.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's assassination, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue working, it's a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking frightens him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when suddenly all their phones began to buzz.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb, they published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers who were on guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out on the street to report."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to dodge their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the initial findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa the dinosaur."
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that its scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said it had something of a "troubled past".
The report in the journal Current Biology called it "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of soil.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink your eyes just a little, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."
Researchers have found that although this herbivore, despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking shell, it was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better with its environment and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor about its body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of animals alive today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the obfuscation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading — think deer, zebra, or armadillos — are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Critical Period must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it's completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but it also preserves in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint your eyes a little, you could almost believe he's asleep."
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it's the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore washed through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that support the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on its sole'.
In the thunderstorm: Mass pile-up on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass pile-up.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured late Thursday afternoon in a mass pile-up.
According to initial information from the police, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm at around 17.00.
Initially, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large contingent of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, an approximately ten-kilometer-long backwater formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstructions on the opposite lane - by numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade noted the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with severe penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It had come to a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: Unsuspectingly, you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up rudely or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions will soon be over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing conductorless ticket inspection.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and validate the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
"If the offer is well received, we expand it.
It is then expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is what Deutsche Bahn calls ticket validation without a conductor.
In order to use them, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do.
You also have to have bought it via the Deutsche Bahn app, DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
For the test customers, a button for electronic validation will then appear.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train conductor arrives at seat Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already validated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to personalise their travel time on the train," says Michael Peterson, Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Anyone who often travels by train knows that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents you need to validate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that you have to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between conductor and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or open space and delays in checking one's own ticket and takes the conductor the time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and he is still lying on the street," it said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was about to tweet live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign that read, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unlocked his rifle and shouted, "I will... Animals kill everyone."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and can call typical."
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters starting on September 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and the black state."
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled of what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free, to liberate ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black woman-child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice by keeping her away."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police department that became a camp area as activists waited for Officer Darren Wilson to be indicted.
There, Ferrell and her daughter bonded with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism totally changed after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food equity and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all happened."
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often whites — in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience — to show that the movement is "not a messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said — she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in humanizing black people."
Moreover, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders who shaped the movie "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," Ferrell said, "and so we're constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up that energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was on the front line, because there's so much at stake in living at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but the racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21/2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
The topic leaves hardly anyone cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "No one needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents are counting on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which will also benefit the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed dry.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - towards Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the farmers' market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women again and again very much.
We have also discovered the butcher's shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
This is also the case in other cities.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent.
But this is probably not exactly low for the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It's a pity, specialist shops are almost non-existent and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmer's market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or will the ghost of Bit-Galerie manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg beforehand?"
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the insane number of - in my opinion - pointless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no more room for a farmer's market hall.
If the farmer's market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear."
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year prison sentence after making classified diplomatic reports public via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was commuted by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created of what someone might look like with this genomic data, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data—the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations—but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by prison, so much so that there was only one photo — a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly uncomfortable in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig — with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had just returned from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That's when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to take a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became disparate pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic strip "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would change Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy encounter.
There's also something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition now, as Donald Trump wages a war against government whistleblowers and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When asked about the strange timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novella.
She shows Manning emerging from the disciplinary arenas of the United States, such as King-Kong, with a speakerphone in her hand.
"If they sideline your speech, then they have won," they say.
"So never shut up."
"It came straight out of a letter she wrote me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibit in person yet — as anticipated in the comic book — but if she does, she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacra huddled together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5" 2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for homicide
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County Court records.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on leave and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with that investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and ready to assist U.S. investigative authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urges suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip stating that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will finalize the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) remaining criteria for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap for compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for reinstating RUSADA, which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping controls in Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for the time being
This was announced by the corporate groups.
It was a pure precautionary measure, it could continue to be assumed from no health impairment, it was said in the message.
From now on, only eggs that have been proven to have tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice remedies may be delivered to Aldi.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The startups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her employees' happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources startups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target special groups and demographic groups, provide anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees, and in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained better insight into what her employees think and feel in her three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores – so you can drill down to see why.
Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture lest you become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial tech website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rise in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepute.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employees can use to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, it can face costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time for "social media to come into its own" for companies to realize that they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent raised $10 million in February funding from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing body of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they do before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued, and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and feel that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well. Companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it's no wonder you'll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's managers don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too heavily on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of that?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication enabled her to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always gaining new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's approaching 11 p.m. when a crowd of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and are showing their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to lighten the burden on players, and it has actually extended its days — at least until Friday's finals.
That's why UCLA's first three practice sessions should begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players' already packed schedules.
The trade-off away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp nearly a week after last season and conducted hands-on practice during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of formal pre-season preparations for their kick-off against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA's rule change, even if it adds another point to players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep struggling, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is over, which won't be an easy task, given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been pelted with footballs that cleared a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms become available during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then get ready to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security guards in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential hoaxes and send them to fact-checkers who may display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful posts, as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement on German that a test of the new fact-checking would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages, said on a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the small Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in Kent's Bewl River Valley and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted this way to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because back then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were also there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so battered with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overrated my welcome a little"), this all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, perusing the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the hyena heads mounted on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree that two families fought over.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380 in this book called 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle's history – such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that wasn't made until years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite Scotney family: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I think of them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent for courting heiresses."
After the end of his assignment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too beautiful for us.
Isn't it?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel.
"We think that (of course!) not really," they write on their website launched yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we, as citizens of Bad Honnef, are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point."
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is spending a mid-five-digit amount on its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (YAS) in Ankara discusses retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So also this week.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the official residence of the Prime Minister.
Under the chairmanship of the head of government, the five deputy prime ministers and the ministers of defence, interior, justice and foreign affairs also took part in the discussions.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is tightening the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been dismissed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been tried in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan described the coup attempt as a "gift from God" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the major clean-up of the army and security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired another 7395 civil servants by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be regarded as the actual masters of the country.
Three times they staged a coup, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing ahead with an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the coup attempt for fear of persecution warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance after the purges about the operational readiness of the Turkish army.
Command structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the green card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It calls for reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter regulations for obtaining temporary work permit visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be debated in both chambers of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by the U.S. will change the way green cards are issued to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to rehabilitate route for Rennsteigshuttle
Again and again in recent months, the future of the Rennsteig shuttle had been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction is to be carried out on the dilapidated route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the route is to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and rehabilitating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the state is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at around 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the state will take over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the state in the future, is currently being finally coordinated, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operator are already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
Thus, the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular train connection between the stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The track is also very dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Professor Emeritus of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking its rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we're going to see them a lot more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm to the touch – with conscious human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" their robot according to their beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color, to the shape of the nipples, to the type or color of its fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots possess the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness, and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as suited to your personality as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be in the mood!"
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots—not least because they replace real human relationships—but the submissive feminine traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step toward Frigid Farrah, worry you the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxia?" the website states.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Most men, of course, won't keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what seeps out of the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times we live in.
And many people aren't weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the intertwined bodies and the gouged eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
They can't part with their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or backstory, nothing suggesting independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the parlance of 2017: maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense.
It has become a Trump-era truism that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided families in miniature.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of relatives voting for Trump.
We all supposedly make an effort to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is Trump's power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with whom she had struggled for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
Around the dinner table, this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the creepy possibility that one day his antics won't repel us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness by his standards.
I find myself infested with an active nostalgia these days for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman — the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) — both of which actually seem very lenient to you compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee just needs to be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parks Department's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders in fear - extremely dark and the jingling music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count – but a large roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can walk on it and everyone has a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it full marks, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could swipe my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the review with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood with an apologetic grin, while I tired of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he mistook his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius' six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released for holidays and secondary schools.
In the future, three of the dismissal students will go to grammar school, four to secondary school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public on Tuesday evening in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released into freedom.
In addition, the lively crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hatch by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was dashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, grades three and four showed a chicken dance in the rehearsal by Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young roosters, who wore top hats.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader to feel accepted into his new school.
This was followed by words of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly steps in when lessons are bottlenecked, and the parent representatives.
The chick time is now over, said class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end, all students sang a song about summer time and holiday time.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted by television.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping, imposing significant fines on anyone found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new promotion mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before that only apply to vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to any person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the framework of it.
How long are the conversions likely to take overall?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily when it comes to the environment."
How long should the update take?
The changeover itself could take as little as three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers do who do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably, foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears this.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there have been no losses in value for older diesels so far.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the award winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees this year.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told the New York Times, "This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights — even deprive them of funds — and that weighs on me."
Estefan, 59, stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks, and Sting.
We make the city worth living in
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city architect, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been the city architect for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for familiarization.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have corresponding degrees.
Because the city wants to keep this function in any case.
If she were no longer able to fill it out, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for consultation.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living in," he says of the building authority and his employees.
But varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: The redesign of the former Hukla site and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
It's fun to work here."
In terms of design, there is great scope for a city architect.
With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, many things can be responded to quite flexibly.
"You can achieve a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is a listed building, it is important to "keep an eye on what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city architect.
In any case, the city architect bears a great deal of responsibility.
He is the client, "in the end, everything here runs over my table".
He can count on long-standing employees for support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (structural engineering) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, anyone who wants to succeed Roland Wacker should have completed a degree in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and construction planning law.
The city building authority is responsible for building and civil engineering, urban land use planning, land acquisition matters, administration of municipal properties, municipal depot with building yard and city nursery as well as lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway line closed
According to police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a prank," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the minutes of delay and the costs for the rail replacement service, penalties of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "substantial" sum is to be assumed, said the spokesman.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be led without hindrances.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that proteins' essential amino acid tryptophan helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan — one of the building blocks of proteins — to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environments when the same system works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice — the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked an gut microbiome and they didn't develop these types of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid — without the bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
A "genius" has signed at Manchester United in Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signing began with a 2-1 win at Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid kicks off on Tuesday, and impressed in the role of keeper as the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, managing just 45 minutes, allowing Mourinho to admit he needed to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new signings, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority signings.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort."
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and stretched over the USA in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously done such advertising.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind is turning: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no disruptive fires from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz has led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even begin to be described with headwind.
They were low blows.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions between the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply can not govern reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition CDU and FDP.
The Greens' federal managing director Michael Kellner has called on the renegade Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to give back her mandate.
The defection to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately give back her mandate," said the federal managing director and election campaign manager of the Greens, the editorial network Germany (RND).
"None of this must be true," sighs an SPD election campaigner as the new bad news reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without his own government majority after Green MP Elke Twesten joined the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
And so it became - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to stagger, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy blew the party down.
The comrades laboriously picked themselves up again in the weeks that followed.
Then, when they had just found new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with it came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state leader, lost his aura that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW emissions affair and his role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticized for some time.
Lousy poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried more and more in recent weeks to set accents in the federal government.
The former mayor of Hanover's efforts to expand his power in Berlin did not go unnoticed by comrades in Martin Schulz's entourage.
They let him go, because they hoped that Weil would stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is basically not to blame for the internal party dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly doesn't.
For the time being, therefore, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and especially at the renegade parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs. Twesten was not elected because of her person as a direct candidate, but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens in parliament, so the Lower Saxony MP further.
The logical consequence would be for her to relinquish her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: The people have made Stephan Weil prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, told the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy falsifies the election result," Oppermann continued.
He demanded that the background be clarified.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments by the CDU in Lower Saxony.
Funding for town centre III
If you want to renovate your aging house, you will soon be able to get support from the state.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations so far are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development and not just to open up new building areas.
On April 4, the Regional Council of Karlsruhe received the information that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 comes from the Land and the remainder from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a redevelopment area created?
According to Schindler, it will be investigated where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in rehabilitating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then shift again.
On Wednesday evening, STEG was represented by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", within the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on a property-by-property basis, i.e. per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be defined as a statute.
The approval period for the funding runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.
By September of this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, during which those involved in the redevelopment area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
If possible, the statutes should be adopted in November or December so that the renovations can begin next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess the urban development deficiencies and to decide when to renovate and to what extent.
A remediation note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann herself would come back to Empfingen and get an idea of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals with the structural condition and the renovation intentions, among other things.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment sheet", information on the size, layout and occupants of a living space can be provided.
The blue "company return" is only to be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted, Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of subsidies works on a "first-come, first-served basis" - first come, first served.
You can't "reserve" subsidies for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty" to those present.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a wave of his hand
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a wave of his hand.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all at an extra cost of £300 per lock.
The married father of one now has technology installed both at home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month is costing taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military data provided to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House Military Office required the helicopter's presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote to his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're closed," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave impetus to health care reform underway in the Senate, and he touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of stories complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the 'Made In America' show — which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House Assistant Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to drop the US president in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted toward the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers didn't take the burden on any of the other props unveiled at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include labor costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I expect hundreds, if not thousands, of people to depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It wasn't clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing a tricky task
Leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga competes at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete tomorrow from 11 o'clock in Kiel at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite a still flawless record after five games, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained his sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good."
Above all, imports from the far north ensure class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV.
"Their Danes and Finns can even point to appearances in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"As always, it will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
Maxime Janvier could make his debut for Blue-White.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The so far undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against Club an der Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In its haste to pass the law," Congress had packed in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Since then, investors in the domestic OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been correspondingly worried.
The threatening backdrop is enormous.
Nevertheless, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has a choice of twelve weapons.
"Die Presse" has looked at which ones the company could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take center stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and featured the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the kindergarten lunch again itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city's day-care centres, the clock is being turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal day care centres (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues to take place outside the home: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past kindergarten year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the kindergarten," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies to 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m."
46 part-time employees will be on kitchen duty from 1 September: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, serve the food, clear away, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the number of hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now an integral part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the kindergarten management to implement pedagogical concepts."
Because that's what it's all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known force in the daycare center, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the kindergarten rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in the cost comparison between self-management and outsourcing, according to the press office.
And this despite the fact that 46 part-time employees are being hired.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections. Three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will peacefully transfer power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.
Hike for the TV anniversary
On the occasion of its 110th anniversary, TV Kaiseringen invites you to a short hike followed by coffee and cake.
The hike starts on Sunday, July 9, at 1 pm in Frohnstetten at the water reservoir in Amerikastraße.
From there it goes to the airfield, to the Natter and over the Waldhof back to the water reservoir.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, allegedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was with friends on Kolpingstraße, around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerned about investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to check with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to know" when their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's store manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie's to "raise concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward".
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are unable to gain clarity from the General Site Manager on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued engagement of employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some issues were discussed openly.
We discussed with employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our businesses – and this applies to all our businesses and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise Tollcross's heritage as a manufacturing facility and should our operations at the site change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?
La Liga's website may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not relent in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record robbery three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for £89m.
After leaving, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to look after him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, there will be consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of property number 30 and thus caused property damage of over 200 euros to the fairing of the vehicle.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car approached him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-Year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was with his VW against 19.55 clock on the B 215 coming from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese on the way.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came towards him in his lane, so that he had to swerve to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle responsible to contact the commissariat in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases exonerates Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is the opinion of author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency that he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the cathedral music director Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their misjudgement of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized that "double standards" were applied to the reporting of violence by the Domspatzen.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "shameful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; What is striking, however, is the "degree of media manipulation," according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider this normal," Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "People like to go to church and that's a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beatings were a completely normal pedagogical tool to deal with naughty children like me."
She thinks it is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoirs "Mein Bruder der Papst" (My Brother the Pope) with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to defend Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because none of this had anything to do with him," he says, assessing the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by Ulrich Weber, a lawyer commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the clarification?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of assaults "with high plausibility", 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused.
The final report on Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "In summary, it can be stated that forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence."
In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen exonerates Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of violence against wards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became violent when a Domspatz did not bring a top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you assess this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the whole 440-page report from cover to cover, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly absolved of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
At best, he can be accused of having learned about it too late or of not having taken initial hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students also give Georg Ratzinger an excellent report, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to outbursts of anger.
Years ago, he himself admitted that he not only slammed chairs and threw his keychain on the floor, but also handed out slaps and pulled overly cheeky boys by the hair or ears, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his credit, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you also know such chastisement methods?
Of course, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I, too, experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and excessive violence in pre-school, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI. that many media pounced on him.
Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is that the report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In connection with the report, the media reported a great deal about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused in the final report of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly not.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral music director.
Not even the parents were informed.
"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," said one affected person on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem in solving sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One interviewed student put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I hold it ... Also really absurd to assume that he of all people ... Boys have opened more insistently or clearly or even earlier, than towards their parents, boarding school directors, counsellors, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that affected students and/or their environment confided in him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be acquitted of any complicity.
Thus, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or reported him.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate one's good name with these vile crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "violent excesses" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former cathedral music director Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report of "looking away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let's say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly from it, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But cathedral music director Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
So at most the accusation remains of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was told about the conditions at preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (according to the witness), and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them "that corporal punishment continues to be practiced in preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press publications, he recommended urgent intervention.
Of course, this was at a time when legal clarity existed, when corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as all of us probably know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked the other way.
This is simply not true.
It was not until 1980 that corporal punishment in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.
What do you think?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitfall of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has always been heinous, nor to what was committed in preschool in terms of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
This is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with.
But at the same time I have to defend Georg Ratzinger, because none of this had anything to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling by the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was banned, he strictly adhered to it.
What image of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in his conversations with you for the book "Mein Bruder der Papst"?
Was the topic of corporal punishment also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But even this must be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution from the Regensburger Domspatzen, which until then had been rather nationally known, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and sweets alone you do not make great singers out of unruly boys and face every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger as during the discussions about your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, kind, deeply religious and good-hearted person, of whom one cannot imagine that he could harm even a fly.
I regularly see how many former Domspatzen still keep in regular contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who still do not forgive him for once being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect, whom they still look up to today and whom they almost adore.
And please, once again very clearly: All he is accused of are educational methods that were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to scapegoat a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, exonerates him.
Now decency would demand that a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without whom no one outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally be left in peace.
