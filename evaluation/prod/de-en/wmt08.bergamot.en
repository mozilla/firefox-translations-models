Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are assumed only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian Central Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the central government. At their discretion, the cut in interest rates would encourage rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment to boost the formation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is seeking to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least slightly at the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in a daily fandle: inflation must be "agreed" in order to exclude action later.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
MATIF wheat prices increased by 88 percent, and soybeans prices also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a considerable inflation in 2007 for edible oil and dairy products.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but they are expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expected to achieve a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate estimated at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to lower interest rates twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After a long period of stagnating, the number of Fidesz sympathizers grew considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, approval has reached an unprecedented low point of 13 percent.
With the opponents loyal to the party, the difference is clearly due to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are offset by one fifth (20 percent) of approval for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry-level hurdle: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters grew by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate - never before has the proportion of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "pronounced bad", so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it to be "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population is expecting a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth comes from an improvement.
A Gallup poll conducted in December found that 71% of respondents - a historical high - assessed the Prime Minister's work as "rather poorly right".
Thirteen percent of those surveyed have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proponents for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of those who think that one can get a grip on discontent with the Prime Minister even without changes of government.
After the unrest last October, 35% had voted to remain in government and head of government, this percentage now amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) see the solution only in new elections.
When asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent said that they would participate "with certainty" and would "probably" another 20% vote.
For comparison, the parliamentary elections would take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "certainly" to the polls, another 15% consider their participation to be "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% would vote against hospital day money.
Laying to the group of referendums "certainly" participants would be the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees even 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trading area once again this year maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trading triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "vonopped" last December, the inflation rate was not drastic in percentage compared to the already high, former level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they had paid for well at the end of the year well under HUF 9,000 for is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HHUF limit by at least HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices for turkey filets, nuts and poppy poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were consistent with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but in Auchan there were 1kg of bread wakes for 139 forints.
There was no competitive price drop in the product at less than 200 forints.
Also surprising was the price of a two litre Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 Forints, so the drink including deposit only cost HUF 257.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison also most expensive, and Cora most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year amounted to 21%.
The average price increase was 1,440.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,26,00 forint, although the VAT increase was noticeable in the prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that trade had been severe: Apparently, the department stores were not quite able to decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were indicative.
(If the trader poorly plans the velocity of a product, he may fall for significant profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to the meh value tax, the inflation of the "Napi" shopping cart last year was so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630,00 forints more than last year, and even with the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, and the price of daily consumables in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: For some staple foods, the Statistical Office noted more than 30 percent inflation over a period of 12 months.
For example, in addition to flour, eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product, which has already been expensive in the previous year, has increased by little more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to shift the drastic price increase to the multinationals.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; there are constant reports of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores are no longer looking at the prices.
Large quantities are purchased from everything, durable food goes into pallets over the table tables.
On Wednesday morning, there were endless snakes in all three department stores at the cash desk, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, the country reports a lower customer frequency, so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
This year more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals, which were due to an improper handling of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in hospitals, overloading of beds, overloading of personnel - all factors which are not exactly beneficial to containment of infections, so the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, an MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The bacterium, resistant to antibiotics, was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The injured of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not yet been performed because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until 10. In December this year, 1,094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, including Karolina Böröcz, head doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
So so many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogens were certainly registered in hospitals, but the number of unreported cases is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their noses without it cause a disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin inflammation or wounds) usually react well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the funds are too highly dosed or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant are formed from the well-responding bacteria, which spread quickly under corresponding conditions in hospitals.
Especially in patients with a weakened or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical head of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is not special, such incidents belong to the daily health routine.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi was looked at - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks in their care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
When they are sent to the hospital, patients are examined for MRSA, but an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by MRSA would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for containing the formation or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection is mainly found in hospitals and old people's homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and immediately isolate MRSA infected persons.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not so often practised.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the state health insurance company.
Most cases therefore only come to light if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, says the medical director of the Epidemiology Center.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the remedy can form, but this directive is not always adhered to by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological sampling is even rare among patients in outpatient or in basic care.
The disinfectants are saved
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transferred by one patient to another by nursing staff.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks, is of great importance, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the local hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds are narrowly lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz continues to point out, there are unfortunately even savings in disinfectants in disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that encourage the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are complied with, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
MRSA infections get under control caused the health insurance company enormous costs, therefore they are combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
According to initial signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made it one of its priorities for the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals.
Death leader police chief was not drunk
In the case of the police chief of the XXII. District caused car accidents with fatal outcomes now is available for the official report.
The now retired police chief of the XXII. District, which killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press secretary of the Budapest High Prosecutor's Office on Friday, after the official report was submitted to the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed any alcohol before he sat down at the tax.
The former police chief turned his own car into XXII. District to Kossuth Lajos Street and has passed over a 55-year-old man, who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street on the zebra crossing, night rank.)
The pedestrian has succumbed to his injuries after he was transferred to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then removed his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has opened its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday on Friday, worth EUR 400 million. The money is to be invested in education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which are being implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The EUR 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier, and the current agreement is about using the EUR 200 million in love.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also expected to be spent on the budget financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will later be decided in the expansion of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contractual partners have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will primarily flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The subway line 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of the metro financing with the EU, the original treaty and possible modifications would be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion projects in Hungary.
The loan interest is provided by EURIBOR, the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, without commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian property market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is attentive to the Balkan state rarely mentioned.
What where, and who buys the EU's still cheapest market, but which is getting more expensive and rather?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought-after plaster for property purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, at the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the Renner are amongst the most popular, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior sooner or later attracts investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extremely favourable area of Russian is also attracting more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - trade and office space offers the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfers' paradises, and thus to attract tourists in the other two seasons in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and the ski resorts are mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down either buy revitalized properties by 500-100,000 euros, or run-down houses by 55,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are very important, but the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are also crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group makes up business people who invest with the aim of promoting medium to long-term value.
Real estate in the capital, however, is constantly becoming more expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, property prices are lowest in Bulgaria, but there has been a price increase of 21 percent per year in the past five years.
The high price of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are discussing the Bali roadmap, which sets out the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol has expired.
A heated debate between developed and developing countries is currently underway.
The US has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would it be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialised countries are prepared to support developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund, which is subject to the Kyoto Protocol, is to be managed by a 16-member Council, presumably due to the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as can be read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 levels), regardless of whether or not the "retail agreement after 2012" was successfully achieved. The Union would even be willing to advocate a 30% reduction, if it requests other large industrialised countries in the world, or Developing countries are also willing to meet their obligations responsibly and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was to reduce only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU, with its then 15 member states, had already committed itself to a minus of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a target that the country will fulfil, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The deployment is high in Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only come into force after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed, international emission reduction system, the importance of which is also the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize, has highlighted in its latest report.
This would delay the reduction in emissions, and the increase in the Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which would mean extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army promotes on YouTube
Units of the British army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube: special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been loading videos about operations against the Taliban on the net, reports the BBC, reports.
The images, mounted with miniature cameras attached to helmets, are checked at the air base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such images, their "channel" was viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defence headquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Department of State (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Comments in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual goals of the foreign missions.
Such kind of published propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertisements, according to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, since they confirm the validity of the military measures adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored shots, also make it into the net - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses at the most are talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, numerous videos shot in use have already been uploaded to the platform of the atlas of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British have only recently discovered this "type of teem".
The Americans, however, are promoting the slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier in the context of a more or less life-throwing simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogat in the ministries
Labour Minister MÃ3nika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she organises a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate live music, others conjure Christmas spirit with raffle or offense atficial hearts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The biggest Christmas party of a ministry will be held this year in the defence department, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of orphans", children are given a gift from fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are served by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (FY/O) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport over the strands.
The 4.32 million forint-like Christmas party of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the festivities is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a raffle raffle.
The National Agency for Development (FNFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint-like Christmas party on Wednesday at the House of the National Council of Justice (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The room rent was 1 million forints, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a member of the NFÜ department is also invited to another Christmas party organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the comedy theatre was rented for the celebration ("VÃ3gszÃ3nház").
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we did not reach the competent.
Why the suit?
The OIT building was not only open to NFÜ guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which was held instead of a Christmas party on 7th. December the Lucia Ball held there.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On request from [origo] they said: There was no ball gown or suit obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and self-government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is organising the celebration for the employees at their own homes for around 400,000 forints.
Labour Minister MÃ3nika Lamperth does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party, but to the conference at the end of the year.
They are expected to have about 180 guests who - according to the press department - are only hosted with coffee and Pogatsche, so the celebration expects 350,000 forints.
Self-Government Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply toast to the ministry's auditorium with his colleagues.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) hosts a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were paid at 2,500 forints per head - around this money there is a buffet reception followed by a subsequent impetus.
Since the beginning of János Veres' tenure, the PM employees have celebrated this way every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the minister's official speech, but also because the celebration for the afternoon was scheduled.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on 20. January to record a New Year's Eve, the Christmas party of the ministry will be cancelled this time.
One hundred guests are asked to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort, the editions are sixteen at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are organised every year, traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and come out with a continuous feast.
As the responding press offices report to [origo] request, there will be no Christmas party either at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not be given any information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to celebrate, which is held in the Museum of Decorative Arts.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation are forming their coordinating committee for the indefinite duration of the strike beginning on Mondays on Friday.
A major protest meeting will be held on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the closing of labour begins.
It is expected to have strike-related, considerable traffic disabilities, since rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport enterprises (BKV) are also on strike until 1 pm.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a major protest meeting will be held, and from Monday, all organizations that have joined the strike will settle down the work for an indefinite period, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees meet to discuss the way forward.
Based on the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted on the Health Insurance Act in the later evening hours, or at midnight.
The strikes that begin on Monday will have to be expected to have considerable traffic disabilities: the railway workers will settle their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies will be shut down.
At the same time, there will be a direction in many places motorway barriers.
Numerous trade unions and civil organisations have followed the call for strikes - the list of participants is continuously updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, others are planning a temporary work stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement on sufficient performance could be reached between the Hungarian Railways MÃ3V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers VDSZSZSZ, although more and more people are travelling by train over the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will be on strike at the BKV from the start of the plant until 1 p.m., at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and thermal energy are putting down work for four hours, and the teachers' union, the Democratic teachers' union respectively, respectively, to 2 and 2 respectively. 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide alternating at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in Health and Social Care Workers, an under-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of the Trade Unions, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government is removing the draft reform of health insurance and presenting a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will become due next year.
Claim three is that the eligible professional groups will be given access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offering concerning the secondary lines, which is subject to the Ministry of Transport, and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for Better Hungary", have raised Hungary's and region's risk in several respects.
The institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things: In the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents the "stifficultment of existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term."
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which presumably aims at the provocation of such an dispute, said the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by those in political centers: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the contrast of Roma Hungary."
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make it impossible for sensible dialogue, favour clubs, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research instance also means that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad has a considerable harm, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the upswing, so that since the summer of 2007 several organisations calling themselves "national self-defence association" have been founded.
"These groups have in common that they define themselves as a civilian organisation, while they openly brag to prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defense (disaster protection, national defence, order cutting), based on the unsuitability of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: all this happened according to the method that attempts to camouflage various political aspirations based on the political and disenchantment of the population, as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association therefore do not merely serve to circumvent legal hurdles that could appear in the course of the registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighboring states, some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirming its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the founding of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has immediately taken the incidents as an opportunity to found the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation is "national protection".
In their opinion, there has been a real "gypsy terror" felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state remained idly and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflict is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to found their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threats by organizing their own protection, according to the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Every year, risk analysis reports are published and if risk-changing tendencies are identified, public opinion is informed, as is the case through the publication of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are precisely regulated by law, so that the practice of re-impiling the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year has earned us less such days.
In the EU and America, too, something else is understood as "celebration".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and non-working days.
Work-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate New Year's Day: both the last day of the old one, and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone can rest with the New Year's Eve celebrations.
Throughout the year we have fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th anniversary of the city. March, which recalls the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd October, the commemoration of the 1956 Revolution.
On the 20th August will be the founding of the state, on the 1. May celebrated the work, on 1 and 2nd November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "work day shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be completed, has been determined for many years by the Minister of Labour in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, to public employees and civil servants alike.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays, are excluded.
This year, the working regulations are only somewhat confused by the holidays at the end of the year: From 24. Life in this country remains literally standing in December, since most take time compensation for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the specially lifted holiday.
Next year, more mid-week holidays will be held in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-evaluations during the working days than this year.
The calendar is first "turned on your head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday 26th April will be a working day for Friday, 2. May can be a rest day.
The second re-unsale hangs with the holiday on 23. October together: On Saturday, the 18th October will be the Friday, 24. October must be processed in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely sign of the holidays, after from the 24th Everybody is lying down and stopping even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent snacks to annoy work colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: They bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether one gets used to these small inconveniences, or one better takes up the challenge and tries to consciously way these unmistakable situations, which are otherwise annoying.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone has called the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it good by perhaps calling with the marketing department and confessing repentantly that you have forgotten to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is dismissed with an apology.
Before being involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can give your colleagues truly unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
What does not belong to oneself?
There is hardly anything annoying than looking for a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it is not there.
Yesterday the stitching was still on the desk - this morning it was gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen about being discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without something, one should not borrow from colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-its from the office in their pockets, because it could hit you for yourself: no one left if you need it urgently.
Praise about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a gossip that has already been enshrined.
Who does what with whom?
Where and why?
If possible, the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tie to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent like a grave instead of hosting those who are not present, even if others are knowing about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick without reason?
If you call in the office to express yourself ill, citing to agonizing headaches, because you feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one: your own work, unpostponable completions, projects with fixed appointments, colleagues have to do themselves instead of one.
So the colleagues don't play along badly!
If you already know the day before that you will not make it to the office the next day, or that something could come up, so that you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with absence.
sum, giggling, phone
One is currently engrossed in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of the colleagues?
Unwantedly heard a telephone conversation that you better shouldn't have heard?
One should not annoy colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), trampling, continuous swear or nories.
All this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deepened in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not ready on time, you have forgotten an important letter or to send important messages, you should not look for the fault of one's forgetfulness in others!
If possible, one should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best way to admit your mistakes is to apologize if others were also affected!
The question of how to make up the mistake, or make up for the what has been neglected, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and flooding: Comfortable for the home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Even then you should not dress so casually if the workplace actually allowed it!
Only not becoming too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to such an extent that you dress in the office accordingly - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
All want to make a calm - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not pampered us with qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene, are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitar violence is "in" again, the local electropop proves that there are news under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, playing music even in the band Yonderboi, before he began to go his own way - perhaps because a thost house does not tolerate two pipers.
But he only made his breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, but only when one approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, became known to the wider audience only when the magazine "wan2" ranked its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and, together with Yonderboi, named the trend setter almost the only marketable in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but none of them were interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album now released entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but in addition to the ethereal character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the zeitgeist and the trends - the influences of rock'n'roll, stand out.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", was introduced at the premiere at the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the mr2 PetÃ3fi, who has recently been selling pop music from early to late, has successively placed the earworm with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything was fine so (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "straight music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can only be produced for sales, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also be created from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to record also works independently of this principle, languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, especially to the west of us.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They are pursuing the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many your music listens to?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, the music does not come into being to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but they only exist in the intangible changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, I noticed one thing: If you want to please everyone, you are not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built up his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go your way, apart from trying to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves more as a team player who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi's were inevitable, since several of us come out of his band and took another path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 PetÃ3fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience consciously staged?
B. Zs.: We didn't have any plans to write a hit, which should then be used as a driving force for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as a finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why they were the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting the choir together from gifted soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-member choir was written - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, EnikÃ3 Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same, or did the girls help shape it?
B. Zs.: There has been the number in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs something.
The sequence of chords formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody that same night, later they learned the girls.
It all came up practically right away and frighteningly spontaneously.
I can remember, I was quite electronic back then, but the "Divas" was needed.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: But both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood in the back of the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: Because of purely technical problems, the fact that they were stood behind it.
However, we did not want to send them any solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where we are on the way, we just allow these certain wings to lift up the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was written.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: There was nothing at all in the musical creative work, there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or on "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything joined together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and even now that I have "loslass" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless fraudsters
His former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local KomerÃ3nÃ3 banka.
It came by almost five billion euros because of it.
It seems rather that Ker was only a big player who wanted to do it the same as his colleagues, certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all large banks, he recognized the crisis on the American mortgage market in time.
"He is more mentally weak," he was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
However, as Kerviels says, which the French media published, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a person who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros with his dealings at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his testimony.
In the summer, he had managed to earn half a billion euros, especially in the American crisis.
He had already spotted the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was already the first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, how they were given to low-income customers or those who had previously had removal problems, would get into trouble.
However, this crisis should not have any influence on the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe that and was right.
At the end of the year, he had scaled up his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
"Already when I earned the first half a billion, I didn't know how to explain this," Ker admits a lot and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything to himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that he would not be found out.
He even managed to deceive his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Did he fear?
Hardly.
"I thought that she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, immediately after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Already during my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
With Allianz shares, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the share's share's losses in London's bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the policeman.
But the bosses supposedly knew of everything, or guessed it.
"As long as I earned money, they closed their eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
He lost one billion euros on a single day.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to balance that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the Bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him upon the shame?
He suspiciously went through a holiday.
"I only took four days last year.
A broker who does not take a vacation is one who does not want you to look at him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to come to €14 billion (about 365 billion crowns) in the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Companies and Innovation" programme.
The most money, about 150 billion, will go into the expansion of traffic.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Companies and Innovation" programme is designed to serve entrepreneurs and companies to generate funds for innovative enterprises.
The companies are intended to gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
With the previous money acquisition of EU funds, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful among the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan Court upholds twenty years in prison for ex-presidents
An appeals court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán on Thursday, to which he was convicted of financial fraud in the amount of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the AP news agency, it is currently unclear whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will fall behind bars.
According to the chairman of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officials whether Alemán is being sent to his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court found out four years ago that Alemán had regularly postponed government money to foreign companies accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of these money eventually ended up in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is by
Yes, it's done.
The state budget has been approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has drafted and was adopted without the opposition support from the majority of the coalition.
The one for the current year was still approved with the support of the SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (by this party) had presented it, and the SSD could not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-naught, yet most significant law in peace.
This is paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past S&D governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure mandatory by law, not only about pensions, but also social spending, which adopted the "settlement" coalition of SSD and KS-M (Communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is deficit-friendly budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and sad under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, in order to open up further sources of investment, except in revenues from taxes, duties and bank loans, often gave bonds without consideration, through which they were in debt to their towns.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying off these debts by massively selling shares in the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state at the train of privatization.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we only stick to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth that the SSD boasts without ceasing.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments caused even more to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have operated much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a huge defilement, which is predominantly attributable to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are the least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there are no need for wet-friendly social programs, which have unfortunately been inflated on a gigantic scale in recent years, entirely unnecessarily.
Even if it has been possible to delete some of the nonsensical populist spending adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the retirement age and pension reform will not come to a postponement of the retirement age and a pension reform, practically any policy in that country will end, and no matter who is in power, no matter what he does.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then, from ruling politicians become officials, who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenues into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would be unnecessary if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years, which was only possible.
If we do not really want it to become pure administrative officials out of ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but it is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take taxes and fees, quiet in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow a gradual implementation of a balanced budget.

Banks want to overcome crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the UK, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than 100 billion dollars will be transferred to the currency markets by means of auctions.
At these auctions, the banks are auctioning interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money from each other.
For example, the American Fed is sending 40 billion dollars to auction, and another 24 makes it loosen for the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time after the attacks of September 11, that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is to eliminate the greatest difficulties faced by the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can confer," wrote in a report for his clients Bernard Baumohl from the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars due to unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can fully do when deciding to take this action," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their clients.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly having an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so, after they were not able to do so. To lower LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used for lenders between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada, and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Reuters agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are implausible
Global climate changes are supposedly hurting developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the ending UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "Ein blauer, no green planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were implausible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompany and reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is just a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his topic was very important to him, and that he was therefore involved in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet my views on caricatures."
Now interested parties could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to understand and assess technical essays, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes were therefore normal, that there was no consensus among scientists for global warming, that the consequences of the current changes were not too great and serious and thus posed no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptablely complex.
Moreover, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers to be unacceptably imposing it on other unproven views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeats that he was not opposed to "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and return."
Two months ago, Klaus had already discussed the same topic at the Hayek Institute in Vienna.
600,000 people did not manage to exchange their driving licence
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when it is possible to apply for an exchange so that the authorities manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the roads without valid driving authorization after the New Year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive around their driving licence who no longer want to drive.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of fucking slip, the offices of the capital are showered with applications, and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The city administration handles around 2000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague approx. 140000 Drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The exhibition of a new driving license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to request the issuance with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not make the prescribed exchange by the end of the year and start without a valid driving licence threaten a fine from January.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a reminder when the police are allowed to be admonished.
In the event of a violation, the penalty can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the community can also be imposed a penalty that does not drive at all.
It was said that he could face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry called on the offices to exercise mildness and to impose a fine of 1000 crowns at most.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand-crown penalty.
The driving license is a document in which everyone can decide whether he wanted to own it or not.
It is not an identity card that everyone, and indeed a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
It is enough to take him to the competent municipal office or send it there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become void.
However, drivers are also gradually having to exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driving licenses from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Kosak, who are accused of having made common cause with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 and 10 years respectively.
In a final judgment, this was decided by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Ams for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years, respectively.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only appeal is possible with the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but the first sentence is before him.
However, in other trials, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned to anything more.
In January, a district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for participation in robberies, the Higher Regional Court now tried the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused disputed the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych, provided, information from police sources, covered various robberies and helped members of the gang to evade prosecution.
The gang left the gang to portray 30 percent of the loot.
The charges are about crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also for preliminary expanse of office and unauthorized possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser riflescope and a submachine gun.
According to the prosecution, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through its robberies.
Except for almost 20 men in this trial, Berdych and a number of others found them legally guilty for further robberies.
Other men from Berdych's area have to answer in another trial, and further cases have not yet come to the court.
The main hearing so far have escaped TomáÃ3 PÃ3ta and MaroÃ3 Ã...ulej, who are in Irish detention and who are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children swapped - Invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million crowns from the hospital in TÃoebÃ1⁄2 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers each two million each, and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondcej Dostál, therefore does not agree with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high," Dostál said after today's negotiation.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the report, which had the opposite side, which had the opposite side.
We will determine whether it has any significance at all.
However, we insist that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of seasons for everyone together," Dostál stressed.
The amount was to be between 100000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloov wanted a million crowns for each month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, an expert report provided for compensation negotiations, which the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him.
According to professionals from the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms of varying strength and depth.
The men earned the stress situation better, even if they were faced with accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, on the other hand, cope with the aftermath of the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is now going on, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola swapped on 9. December last year nurses of the Department of Delivery in TÃ3ebÃ3.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Ã...ermák in PÃ3ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor BroÃ3 and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloov.
At the end of October, the district captain of the Vysoina (Böhmic Moravian Height) gave each family 100,000 crowns as a substitute for expenses caused to them by the mistake of the hospital in TÃ3ebÃ3, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally can they apply for assistance from the sponsor.
The courts have so far suffered relatively low damages, the amounts have been determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally million.
Polvka came around his kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polvka lost the dispute over the "Kingdom of Wallachia" brand.
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team of TomáÃ3 HarabiÃ3 in cooperation with the actor for many years of work.
Today, Polvka did not participate in the hearing.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is unlikely to come to an end and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. HarabiÃ3 and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek PolÃ3vka parasitically," said PolÃ3vka's lawyer after the trial.
Everyone introduced themselves to these actor and comedy at the words "Saleakh Kingdom".
The same opinion is also Harabi.
"We have had almost ten years of work.
Raising money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the reason is a dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project is successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to gain parasitically on our work," he continued.
Lucratives business
According to the court, Polevka used the term "Sale-Aking King" for the first time in one of his television programmes.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat.
But that did not hang together at the time with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi's thought of spending Wax passports.
From an originally fun campaign, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, followed by HarabiÃ3 the founding of the company "Saleakhic Kingdom".
In 1997, Polvka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also argued today that HarabiÃo used only the mere idea that PolÃ1⁄2vka had made public in the "Manege" programme for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polvka has certainly helped the project of the Wallachian Kingdom," said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the HarabiÃ3 project and his team were dedicated to him intensively.
The cooperation of the parties today lasted until the year 2000, when HarabiÃ3 organised the official coronation for PolÃ3vka in VsetÃ3n.
Since then, however, the disputes began to accumulate between Polvka and Harabi, which culminated in the detachment "King Boleslav I elected up to St. Nicholas Day".
The leadership role was then held as Queen Mother at the suggestion of HarabiÃ3s Jarmila Ã...uláková.
In 2002, PolÃ3vka filed the lawsuit against Harabi and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabia for the throne and half a princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
He did not want to reveal details and an appointment.
"We don't want to rush.
It should be something like the king's moving in Wallachia.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polvka can also register," added Harabi.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Preliminary portions dwindling
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of gear shifting, steering and processing could be described as rather below average.
After all now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a little further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain about the too low headroom in the back seats, for example.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even bimeter men will suffer.
Fast on
I only go through the interior briefly so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have objections only because of the miserable central tunnel.
I would welcome a little more design, where the car will otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the days are over where we may have complained about too short seats or headrests.
The page support has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combination, the already mentioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the loading space.
I have to describe it (also because of the hinged back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with retaining straps, which are an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But we talk about the loading volume.
According to the table, it is 428 litres in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we notice that the Peugeot is left by a clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller.
But to emphasize the Positiva, I still have to mention the very flat loading space or the very low loading edge after folding around the back seats.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kW.
And honestly, this is how a 1600 Kubeak engine should look, which drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Ã...koda, who sometimes seems as if his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
However, we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious innner and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still possible.
With our engine it costs from 410 900 crowns, which is quite a lot.
The Premium equipment of the test car comes again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric windows rear and...
The car costs a total of plain 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar amount.
So the only decision remains which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils at schools does not succeed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which causes fears among the locals about the further development of the local education system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even note cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe at schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Streitereien, harassment and further winches among pupils have transferred to the relationships between their parents.
The situation has already developed to the point where the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended herself by insulting her with racist abuse.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us, and then exposed his buttocks," a mother of Slovak student described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks are reported, who came here searching for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will satisfy yourself if you choose only the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported them to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 20th century. century.
One of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, let it be installed, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (especially during prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were amongst others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, skyscrapers grew, over the wide boulevards were driving cars, which were among the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last year dog.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in CojÃ3mar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the 1950s are still driving around in Havana, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
If Havana, especially its oldest part, have been strongly run down, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights as it is here.
Other places are being cleaned up, for example Trinidad.
In view of tourism bringing much-needed money, there was the green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have emerged not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguin and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a clootte, which is unique in the world and attracts railway lovers in particular.
The sugar cane of remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-powered narrow-gauge railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see cute and fully functioning locomotives whose peers somewhere else in the museum.
Excursion destinations
The most important places do not miss the majority of Cuban visitors.
So you no longer have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It remains to be mentioned that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate, whose visit should not be missed by the person who likes this writer.
The valley of the city in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in its cavities fertile soil collected, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The richness was embodied in the pretty beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century, which would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to it going unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth taking a look at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa AncÃ3n or the "Valley of the Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la MÃosica, which enlivens after the darkness, and where the music does not keep silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in the whole of eastern Cuba some call the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads, which lead from Guantánamo, have to overcome high and tinkered mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included in its World Heritage List thanks to the unspoiled nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was built about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous, are to be seen from the hill.
About the coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra-Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves are professed, many of which could be written about.
But, as they say: Better look at with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
According to the United States, too little soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow their own ideas, about this in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries stationed in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Deferral Minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
"A forward development is felt in Afghanistan, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow residents to start the development of the economy and security themselves," says the BBC's British Minister of Notification.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, and in the southern Helmand province even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have about 40,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan, about a quarter of whom are in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and about the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, expressed a similar opinion today.
"I am not pleased with what we have at our disposal in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters agency at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
However, they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British tabloid "Sun" described the German soldiers as lazy this week.
"Afghan doubters unmasked: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers who play table tennis.
The German Bildzeitung went over to counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Sovereign debt will skyrocket in 2009
Every Czech accounts for a national debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself this year with 159.2 billion euros.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of the state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The sovereign debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
As a result, they rose by 40.2 billion euros within the first nine months of this year.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on the national debt from early October.
Each Czech accounts for a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the whole of the past year, the state was in debt to more than 111 miliary crowns.
"Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not exceed the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should range between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, Patria Finance analyst, the server iHNed.cz.
VladimÃ3r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, looks similar: "We could come to exceed one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be prepared to save more, it could take place until 2010.
But I don't assume such a change," he noticed.
Debt growing
The national debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The sovereign debt is financed by treasure prices, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic public debt has risen to 719,4 billion this year.
The state's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has declined by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how good the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the increase is particularly noticeable in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes," commented Pikora's dates.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and dealing with the sovereign debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of the state budgetary policy, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount comes primarily from the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also principal funding for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of sovereign bonds for 43 billion euros and granting bonds for bonds at the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion.
For the fact that she has given a name to a teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion on Thursday evening.
The British woman was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils had complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was picked up at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code.
In fact, this matter begins in September, when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
"The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favourite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for the class, with the photograph of the bear on it and the caption 'My name is Mohammed'.
The bear itself was not covering a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple, that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, declared that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to approach a religious belief, "I only regret that she has asked the children to vote for a name", in his opinion it was only a 'innocent mistake'.
An opinion that many students share the teacher who describe them as 'very attentive to their students' and as a 'person who never speaks about religion in the class.
Consider that the name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given in Britain, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This first name, which is often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of reverence to the prophet (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, allowed to give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, the last negotiating session in Vienna did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion session in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status," said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the fact that peace is at stake in the region, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called for their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
"No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time," he added, indicating that there are clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10. December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet one last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% inhabited province by Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko until the 10th century. Submit their report to the UN Security Council on December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and final negotiating session since the Troika last August had been given the task of the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate on the 10th of October. December will end.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond this end date.
"Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a consensual solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After eight years under the administration of Kosovo, Western countries are keeping independence under the EU's supervision for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
"Untilly, no agreement could be reached," said the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where since Monday these 'negotiations of last chance' have been conducted.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regret.
However, he added that the plan for autonomy proposed by Belgrade belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
'Domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the opinion that a compromise was always to be sought, and warned the Albanian majority of Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade thinks that it is especially a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of the independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible," he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be taken solely on the Security Council where its Russian ally has a right of veto.
'The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
"Only one decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations have taken two years.
They must end the way they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists responded to the journalists that "Kosoan Parliament would have the last word on status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence would be held by the Albanian-speaking population 'in voting' with the Western countries.
Bush elicits an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He further explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a 'peace treaty' before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy 'the terrorist infrastructures' and Israel must stop his colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the 'road plan' for peace that they agreed to in 2003.
The White House head said that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas were ultimately pursuing a peace treaty to clarify all outstanding issues without exception, and including the central questions".
This term includes the three serious problems around which the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians mainly revolve: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, which were expelled from their homeland, which lies in the present-day state of Israel, in the course of the 1948 conflict.
According to the American president, Abbas spoke and insisted that the coming negotiations be conducted 'comprehensively and thoroughly' and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, he undertook to ensure that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations were conducted “directly and without interruption” and that he would endeavour to ensure that it could be ended before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his 'vision of two states', one Palestinian and an Israeli one that coexisted, at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab areas that were occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks at the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," says the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the initial results of the investigation of the Polzei National Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
"He had no operation, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light," explains a spokesman for the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "without approval, not released for public road traffic" (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, hit "with very high speed".
"It rammed the left side of the police car after it disregarded its right-hand direction," a policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out during vehicle passengers is a lot negative.
The condition of the car (denter fender, splintered windshield, demolished bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Maria-ThérÃ3se de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigator about the "facts of involuntary personal murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main head office for public safety of Val-d-Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that she ruled out the investigation of the IGPN at this stage the responsibility of the police.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident who were heard Sunday evening confirmed, "the version of the policemen, namely that this small motorcycle has reached their left side relatively quickly".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained intact until the police managed to slow down.
The vehicles were seized and will be the subject of a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were obducted yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, a rumour quickly made the rounds in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the scene of the accident very quickly, without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude this thing regarding 'any serious errors'.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are necessary and in which one must proceed very carefully".
Libération has met an eyewitness to these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
"We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw a completely disturbed police officer who limped.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth phone.
In view of the tension that quickly formed around the events and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unhopeful situation of the young people, the police officers were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the scene of the accident.
According to this testimony, the emergency services arrived 'approximately twenty minutes after the police leave the police.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
"I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces had not helped the young people.
These young people have been given first aid.
The fire brigade came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her," the prosecutor, for the part, stressed.
In Pakistan, tension rises
On Monday, Pakistani police squandered the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had been declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonized the measures taken against the emergency measures were demonized by the tear gas grenades who appointed the law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition members, human rights advocates and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been found in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northeast).
The lawyers movement received on Monday the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president called on the people to send flowers and waste to those who took an oath before Musharraf to the judges who had spoken out against the emergency.
"Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Pakistan Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days, he was forced to re-election to President Musharraf's legality in a direct ballot on the 6th edition. October Take a stand.
The chairman of the court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
"All what we represent is illegal, antique and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," said the magistrate of The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give command of the army and become a civilian president 'does no longer apply' since the emergency eradication, said the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
It was expected that he would hold his military uniform until the 15th century. November would be deposited, date on which his first term of office as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the rumours in the country that persistently hold, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than one third of pregnancies are still not planned
This calculation takes into account the undesirable pregnancies (24%), as do the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the undesirable pregnancies (24%), as do the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception, such as the pill or spiral, still have a 5-6% failure rate.
According to the institute, which states that the percentage of pill users between the ages of 20 and 40, which use the pill, has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless allowed better 'control of fertility'.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
With one of five couples even calculated exactly for the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar panel, which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific work on the station.
A daring exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools to carry out the repair, has achieved several records by the astronauts 'gebastelten' tools to carry out the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part, which will soon be hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module labs.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5-ton module for generating electricity via solar panels, which was already on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After she had moved it, the crew set about the restructuring of the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like chord ceilings, was damaged by a clamped cable over a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped so as not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle Discovery for a control passage and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best Spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, it has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore chosen to "operate" the 'injured' solar collector.
After he had examineed the damage, he cut the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged area.
He was supported by a second 'Spacewalker' who remained near the lock, and, inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels, which generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had thought up on board the station and had 'made'.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded up before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery today, probably on Wednesday.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the aviation and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion to counteract the reserves of the A400M, EADS shares are currently showing a significant downward on the Paris stock exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR21,99 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to reiterate its 2007 forecasts to check the residues caused by the slow-moving development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between €1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month gap.
As a reminder, EADS’ business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large A380 carrier aircraft.
The group had originally scheduled a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when counting the polls: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very sealed election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast on public stations to the voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kremlin Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announcing.
Yesterday, the president did not show anything when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers, which are accused of interfering - his favourite subject during the election campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud,” he added.
From the opposition's point of view, they have lost their way.
It denounces an election campaign tainted by oppression.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Chess World Champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illicit protesters, according to his lawyer, continued to ban visit.
"The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two many further questions raise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The term of office announced yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, the 2. March 2008; the candidates have until 23. December Time to get known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority of parliament and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That is tradition.
"The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not master of their fate," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Koposov of St. Petersburg State University goes back even further: bourgeois society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries, and the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again picked up on the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully assumed by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians 'renounce' free will on personal responsibility, which they showed for a short time after the disintegration of the USSR.
"Where far superiorly too long?"
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to keep the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional leaders) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Where to think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they replace?"
A difficult souvenir
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen over a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now, unless it has been observed with a 'humanitarian' intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. to the query of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the USA, commissioned with their administration, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
Once the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been in force since yesterday.
Heikle information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to investigate, "especially through the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of the forced labourers," explains Reto masters, heads of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, based on the delicate character of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent staff work in tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to bathroom aerosols.
"You must not expect anything fundamentally new in these documents," had Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, declared in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission the green light to open negotiations last April, with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
"A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas, and 'India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans," confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange 'goods worth 47 billion euros every year and 'services worth 10 billion euros', this week had Daniéle Smaja, chairwoman of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, declared, and regrets that the mutual trade has 'not yet reached out its potential'. The EU and India will meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England expressed concern on Thursday to contain the current recurring concern about credit terms and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusual offer.
"To mitigate the fears that the conditions at the financial market will be particularly harsh at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intended to provide a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which was held on the 6th. December begins to offer in the form of an open marketet operation for five weeks," she states in a message.
The Bank further states that in this way on 6. December 12,15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the property tax rate and only until 10. January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has brought out liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation.
This is usually done for a week.
In its message, the BoE adds that it is ready to take further measures to receive the 'interest rates' of intermediate loans with their basic interest rates, which are different from day to day.
The different intermediate interest rates from day to day on Wednesday were 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has levelled off to 6.6%, slightly higher since the 18th century. September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that prevented the banks from using them.
According to certain rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound price as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous interest rates and with certain discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was created in the context of a socialist 'naire' (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), gave about ten measures adopted by the PS National Committee on Wednesday, the majority of 50% of which the employment allowance, the re-establishment of TIP, to a transport cheque or to narrow the rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered occasion to sometimes violent exchange of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's teleview article on purchasing power.
The leader of the MEPs of the PS, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group will present the entirety of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative plan for the correction of finances, which had been examined by the assamble last week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, nothing more and nothing less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably be from 8.-10. August on a 500 acre private farm approx. Take place 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in the Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, in his capacity as co-owner, has also been taking care of the production, the license concessions and the organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspirative event he has ever attended, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn are working side by side in parallel to the area to offer the area a European-style festival event.
"We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are busily working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza Festival back to life at Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after having profiled itself in the world of the festival with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
The two events in 2007 each account for 9.8 million and 11.8 million. can reach gross tax saws.
These two festivals take place in urban environments.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours are more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, in order to simultaneously give the impression of a rural festival on the European and a city in the American way."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking on the burden of this event," says Charlie Jones.
More recently, it refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and include a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
Its partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if there is no lesser than the Terminator.
These attempts to lure are among the delegates' tasks.
A politically "heikle mandate" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think is the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, placing the local cinema is a top priority at the moment.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although Sundance's, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had been on the 30th anniversary of the season Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago a successful performance.
It will be presented in January at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival presented in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange coming up a last year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the coming final year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that "authenticatedly, the month of December on the stock exchange usually goes along with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to compile forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not if serious tensions determine the current market activity
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong increase in the price of the last weeks of the year, these nevertheless note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants. Due to the lack of secure equity funds, they invest mainly in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the low-rise trend towards high-returning assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend a rather lateral price influenced by market fluctuations, "mainly because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the Federal Reserve, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the increase in crude oil price and the risk of the inflation rate."
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an imminent market rally.
"The chances are not very good," assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already had been a member of the capital since its maximum mark on 8. November from 15.945.7 points a value of 4% lost.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional supplement of the pension fund, which was carried out every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasises that things could develop slightly differently this year, mainly due to the final year rally, which was already held in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the day of the bridge on the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect the market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at an almost technical level, which could lead to the fact that a deviation from the index values could soon become apparent, the proportion of which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that they will be positive.
The analysts agree on selecting the values that are to drive the Ibex to new maximum.
Solana of Intermoney asserts that "this year is their great values."
The value winners would be the expert including the two major banks and some real estate companies, "da the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industry sectors.
If the rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
"The ACS has been on track for course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path," says the expert.
With regard to increased consumer behaviour during the day of Christmas, periodic consumption will determine market activity in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only had declining price trends in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, it led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, when the Ibex 35 caught up 28.17 percentage points, December had an increase of 6.68%.
It becomes clear whether 2008 will be the fifth profit-to-be year in a row (the Ibex has been increasing by 8.36% since January) and also has a final year rally.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
These branches represent a major milestone for the institute, which operates under the Popular Max brand name.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, since Popular is the first banking group to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays to 8.30 pm and to set it on Saturdays from 10am to 8.30pm.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement in which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday in the afternoon, although not to customers.
Whether further banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business hours, will depend on the experience of Popular Bank.
And this is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their location, can record the purchasing customers of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changed opening hours.
To this end, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning it with the individual customer profile of the various zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterised by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative, Angel Rivera, assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was associated with increased personnel hire, as one branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says ngel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Via streets have been selected for this, which seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages approx. 2500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These specialise in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
"We do not want to be a competitor for our customers," explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have come to the agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco is doubling its stock market value for the first time, thus overtaking its rival Antena 3.
"We did it."
With this rate, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the close of stock market. The station led by him had increased its value by two times its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: 'This is exactly what hurt me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses," he found.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they have “not fallen too low.”
Telecinco ended the day with an increase of 2.54% yesterday.
This profit reduces its losses to this year's previous year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, goodwill now reach 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the majority of capital (52%) and Vocento holds only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value amounted to 2,193.46 million to half.
The market value of other listed communications companies, on the other hand, is increasing; in the case of Sogecable, to 3,571 million, Prisa (editor of Cinco DÃas magazine) to 2,518.53 million and at Vocento to 1,79 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are 'two similar companies', says Vasile.
The question of the extent to which we can actually act on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can construct it at customer level, seems unclear.
A week ago, Telecinco declared its plan to rise to become the first television channel with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues this year. This was insured by Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaa, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the station would increase its advertising income by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million of the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine trading-banking months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business had only an increase of 0.7% (630.4 million).
The analysts see the main factor in the comparison to better market progression of Telecinco in the high payout ratio that the company has shown up to date: In 2006, the company, headed by Alejandro EchevarrÃa, prompted a 100 percent dividend payout.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol shares, with Mediaset as the parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
"We are obliged to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated much more so far.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, the share values of which we have already been able to increase the share values by purchasing 33% of the end-molpole shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% in 2009.
This results in the cut in the expected growth rate, which will decline from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2009 and 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: focuses on its high return on effectiveness and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: attaches a more precise position to Telecinco (to buy) as a result of the 'multiplier incentives' and the prosperous market than holding Antena 3.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reduce expectations in both cases in the face of 'similar threats' (saturated market and poorer economic climate)
The Congress agrees to the MIFID policy, which was held on 1. November came into force.
In parallel to the parliamentary elaboration that ended its meeting with the Congressional Decision in the Senate on the additional/amendment applications associated with the project, the government published the provisions derogating from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible regulation in their negotiations and votes, which ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market activity.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which redefines the Investment Services Regulations, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to offer financial advisories to both specialised companies and to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), consulting firms that match the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
It also expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that regulated markets are added to regulated securities business systems and the systems for the internationalization of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic actors.
The law obliges investment companies to explain the focus of their company profile, confrontation and forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate their control task for the CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Commission provided for further changes afterwards, whereby the decision that the bond with titles must now be considered a 'complex' financial resources due to its high level of risk for the investor, and has been confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the directive was used to legally narrow the border between the work areas of economics and graduate; 30 years after the 1977 the regulation, which was restricted by the areas of work reserved for economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works for third-party account, does not need authorization on the part of the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for recruiting clients at the same time to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (CPI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator that serves the Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend that took place in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seeks a settlement of location and quality on US products by announcing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be created early by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time uses various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not present at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the early determined indicator only serves as a benchmark, and therefore with the final result, which is the next 14th cent. December will be announced that it does not need to coincide.
'The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Vice-Government and Economics and Finance, Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a 'temporary development'; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a 'relatively high' level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that "even if the current number is not good", Spain's inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union has remained 'more or less' the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were 'less surprises' in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a sharp increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Economics and Finance Minister announced the forecast published today.
Virgin uses Northern Rock to account for over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock's valuation stocks have fallen by more than half, after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September of last year due to the crisis, and now they amount to only 12,000 million. Pounds (this represents 16,800 million. Euro).
At this point, the bank's assets amounted to a record 25,000 million. Pounds, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months as a result of the loss of confidence of customers, and also despite the 100% guarantee of the government that the money is secure, will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which the group would continue after the acquisition under the Virgin Money brand name, has to contribute about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed there from the investments over the next three years, in order to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known through his striking promotional campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to be 50,000 million. Pound (corresponds to approx. 70 million Euro) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies were involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested on alleged suspicion of participating in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to the municipality of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was exposed this week.
In addition, one of the local council secretaries and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José MartinÃ3nez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, be the original mastermind of the plot.
The officials continue to search the municipality's and the Ministry of Urban Planning accounts and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of becoming the main suspect in the case of urban planning corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'populären', and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested when leaving his client's place of residence for important incriminating documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report on the alleged order payments Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban planning contract in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Currently, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the election of the PSOE in Toledo and, if an election victory, in Congress.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory for the Socialists, will take over the office of Congress president.
José Blanco, Organisation Secretary of the PSOE, announced it in the press conference, for example, after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party's headquarters.
According to the Heads of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is 'important in politics to be able to count on the best' and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists, the Mancha-born politician would be running as chairman of the Congress for the Party in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martin as president of Congress. This one had held on the last 15th. In November, announced that he will no longer be competing in the next general elections, to end his career in public politics and instead advocate for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that the president had continuously pushed the president to return to political events since his resignation two years ago.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Business, the party did not want to withhold from the citizens who would take over the post of Congress president in the event of an election victory, and described it as a 'act of transparency'.
If he actually takes over the office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a 'house of respect and not of insulting or cry', in order to make it appear more and more similar to the 'citizens'.
"Unfortunately, one gets the impression from time to time that the only place where one cannot speak quietly and calmly in Madrid is the congress; so the president of the state was once interrupted up to 26 times."
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel MartÃ3n and "his good work" and indicated that he did not want to give up the semblance of having already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call this 'rogance'.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate subjects both the sceptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate to the fore in this respect a merciless criticism, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of the President of the Government Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts it in an explanation of action, or Non-action of its government, which has made a decisive contribution to ensuring that Spain is at the head of the EU within the EU, which have met the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol least.
Who are those responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, which sectors are due to this, and why his government, which proposed the 'Treaty with the planet', has not stopped this development.
He is also now forced to explain the measures he wants to tackle measures against climate change that they are intended.
Which companies will be affected, which behaviour of citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be carried out and what economic consequences result from this.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, it has and will not be included in the future.
Precisely because it is about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be used really against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE appeared to be so dangerous to Zapatero, wanted to be so dangerous that he was forced to take back the proposal.
Accordingly, it is time to save the planet with nothing, that is, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise so suitable for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor do the demanding, but instead pursue the demanding edition of decorating the meetings and inspiring others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or that we are only allowed to refresh ourselves with a fan.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, a popular politician José Martinez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody for the alleged suspicion of urban construction violations, it was now said by investigative circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and whose premises it is still located, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction administration of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the searches that were already held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which turned out to be redesigned that more than 2 million hectares of untapped urban projects were to be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company 'Nuaria'. This was to build 4,000 dwellings on the property after the local administration had it had illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other people were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrested were brought before the judge today.
According to investigation circles, Juan Morales is also investigated against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the group 'Nuaria', the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de InmonuarÃ3 Pablo M.G., whose company is acting as a group of Ã...NuariaÃ3 and is said to have received the bubble.
The investigation is carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives continued to conduct eleven more searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies that were directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At this time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The construction group "Nuaria" was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the village belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of space in Totana, which had to be restructured. The aim was to create a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Corunna, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el CatÃ3lico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the book of the month and instead try to invent a price name of other names with the appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to endorse your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which takes a stand on the note published in the same newspaper on November 18; coincidentally on the day, the issue of which contained the criticism of the Blackburn book.
"The content of the subject of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on the teachers to take a more critical stance on Plato and proposed that Plato's teachings from the sublevel curricula for the subject of philosophy at grammar schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of the law that would be punished with six months' imprisonment.
But if you robbing a music business below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you robb the transaction up to a value of 1000 euros, theft will be classified as a pedicure, but the penalty is lower than with a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less severe to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participate in a rebellious dispute result in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, the authorization of which has not been done by the authors, is subjected to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic footage to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has scaled up his demands quite up.
4.
My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: "Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially if the others get more of it."
So the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomography-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science Festival Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his teammate failed.
The researchers were able to see that the brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and therefore also got the same content; but if one of them received double, there was also a stronger brain activity."
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Its office is in the public prosecutor of the Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia, resident in La Haya.
Its mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye, since the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre - in which eight thousand Bosnian Muslims were killed - namely ex-general Ratko Mladic and former Serb-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at the release.
Their names are on the list, which is the Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a model for the title of his documentary film 'La Liste de Carla' (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York with the pace of a political thriller in their plan to track down the criminals and put their governments under pressure.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
It is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we are dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an policyholder.
This agreement is set in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and in return is obliged to submit the corresponding severance amount in the event of a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance company composed of several factors, including. Age, gender, time of creation of the driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due if there is a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25 and women have to make fewer contributions, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since they, according to the statistical values and therefore also the reasons of the companies, they tend to accept fewer accidents such as single persons.
The benefits attached to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best suits his personal needs.
At this point, we now list the most important points that should be taken into account when selecting an insurance company in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under-age those under 25 people make numerous obstacles to the choice of a low-priced insurance, such as the low driving experience and the 'young' driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to take out fully comprehensive insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full cash match with excess, so that the benefits of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer has to pay a part of the amount incurred by the damage.
The amount will be determined before the contract is concluded and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is higher the lower the amount to be paid," explains Luis Noguera, Spanish's main representative at First Europa, a mediation company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that insures the customer against external accidental damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here is an council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is up to you to reduce the insurance costs, thus increasing your credit by trying to drive carefully and avoiding accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the tariff.
"The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has had a year of profit, it can afford to increase the bonus payments," explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate is decreasing with increasing driving experience.
It is therefore most useful to opt for fully comprehensive insurance with a deductible.
"Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving," explains the Spanish head of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the 'fear of the beginner' has been taken.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full comprehensive insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person also allows it.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and their contributions are also low.
In this case, full comprehensive insurance with excess (with an amount of 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which only uses for the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more relaxed overall and have greater purchasing power, which allows them to make a higher contribution payment," notes Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is advisable to take out full comprehensive insurance with excess (with an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance policy, which only uses with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be said that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damage, but also because it has high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the round of 16 in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point they lack the point they want to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while they decide on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs one more with nine points to ensure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two matches of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan has to compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the entry into the final for the first time on the 13th in the semi-final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before all others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not speculate at home, because the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would become a group leader in the event of a victory and would therefore have a better starting position in the round of 16.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be enough to a defeat in a slack of FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because the Ukrainians are at nine points of tie the participation; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win in the second match (2-0).
So the Milanese will try to spoil the Scots on the evening. They in turn hope to reach the round of the round of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after they were defeated in the exact same round in the leading season by a goal of Kaka in the aftermath (1-0) and by a zero to zero tie in the first leg.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the 'Rossoneri' to win, the team will have to concentrate on their own game, as both the reaching of the round of 16 and his membership at UEFA depend on his victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could achieve third place by winning a victory, thus playing at UEFA UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start of their first tour after the band disbanded the band in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver stadium that the mood in the reunited band is an outstanding.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video on the history of the band, which caused a sensation at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two other new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which is released in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden armbands on stage, which the husband of 'Posh Spice', the English footballer David Beckham, had previously given them.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience, who made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his spouse Victoria had banned him in the previous days.
While the preparations for the schow, Victoria told Beckham that the British star "had not come to see our wardrobe once, and that's why I'm really curious about what he will think of the performance.'
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to inner disagreements" led to the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
"I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world had changed, that the feelings to the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not, so I'm happy to have made this decision," Chisholm said she said was about to separate the band that had caused her nine years ago.
The singer also said that "the disputes have been removed and everyone wants to become very happy."
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special machine for Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, following the report from the CTV television station.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, in San José (on December 4th) and in Los Angeles (on the 5th and 7th December).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on the 23rd of December.
New fears of natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute is smoulding between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to be affected by fuel to Western Europe.
Most of Russia's exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) are routed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is being observed very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states reduced deliveries to the EU states last year.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is happening at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian government gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the company has agreed to pay up to 50% additionally for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks," said Ukraine's Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, driving up prices drastically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas resources, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "musss control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the supervisory body.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish public health service does not have exact ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly on a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined personnel recruited outside the countries of the European economic area, as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at Old Bailey in October, and was charged with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
The state health service is expected to carry out checks in advance of hiring foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The auditor's report now states, among other recommendations, that the Board should pick up on guidelines for the extract from penal register that helps employers with checks in various countries.
"Although we found references to these checks in some personnel documents, they were not routinely carried out," the report stated.
Black said Scottish health authorities would be following their investigation guidelines to a large extent before employment, but added, "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information about the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the run-up to the employment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that NHS' current pre-employment tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the boards have difficulty identifying those employees who are on leave for an indefinite period.
The investigation also found that established control procedures were largely observed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
This includes passport, work permits and qualification controls.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for checks before starting employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on check-up inspections would be reflected in the run-up to the employment of all employees, including those from abroad, would be planned to be published next month.

And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for making the British film a crash into the world.
The prizes were presented in a ceremony at London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
The black and white film - whose soundtrack is found The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was shot for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has earned the Dutch photographer Corbijn, most known to the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, who has earned two awards - as the best director and the best directorial debut.
Rock music was the center of another winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the prize for the best documentary.
The prize for the best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a rider of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's thriller Easter Promises, which plays in London.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He is my type man, a great actor of his time, I am really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group including filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 Arrested in Saudi Arabia for a Terrorist Plot
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil facility, as well as to clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid gripping force to protect plants after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell headed by a "rocket expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees had to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned cleesics to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias, which want to fight the allied armed forces and the U.S.-based Shia Muslim government, who are considered heretical by the hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias regard many clerics in Saudi Arabia as standing in collaboration with the authorities in support of the politics of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qa Qa leader to target it to the pro-Western Saudi government - are said to be targeted at foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," said one spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote the "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims, who are being fired as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could reveal an outlook on the future of Earth
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on an orbit shows that the planet is even more like an averted twin on Earth than was previously aware of.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor on Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, scientists believe today that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable on Venus.
But because of the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight, and a slower speed of rotation, Venus took a completely different development course.
Today, the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express spacecraft of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sobering view of how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different to that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Abunded Uranium" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being inspected.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate ultimately agreed to ask the presidency to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters include questions on video and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions that are on Wednesday evening, the 28. November, were raised as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But this time the questions, and the answers, precisely reflected the state of the Republican Party, which is setting off in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate who selected the prospective candidate's YouTube clips to be shown.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, was the focus of immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed heads of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake off the reputation that he was turning back in terms of illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney, where he accused the former governor of Massachusetts, of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two were particularly violently looking after when questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, managed to check on the issue.
Neither of the two men has serious chances of being nominated, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they have hit the immigration bouke earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates generally share the same views: tougher borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears of toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believe every word in the Bible.
This led Giuliani to arguing that although the Bible was his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to first place expectations in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatorism - said that the death penalty is painful, but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would advocate them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent fundraising successes and his storms of applause in Wednesday debate.
These two have shot up out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has convincingly combined the party from the beginning with a victorious message about America's size and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to end up; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sold, no politician's Parisian hotel bills were paid, no extramarital toes have been suckled.
But the exposure that a wealthy businessman has covered up more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for more than four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report it has done anything without that of the embattled Gordon Brown would have come along well.
When the Prime Minister had stripped himself against demanding an election, stupidly offensive the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly astute chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean developed.
The clumsy rescue of Northern Rock, a smitten bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under attack.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have encouraged business associations against the government.
The tax authority loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative chagging.
A retired trio of retirement leaders launched an uprising in the upper house to protest against cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and their former head of fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown will irrevocably set off towards departure.
Yet governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
Neither do people may nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not even need to be long in the process, this postponement is over: the public service begins to leave; the cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As if he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax accountants, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's miscareptation - as in the long "money for nobility" investigation of political party finance - voters may assume that it was.
Nevertheless, Brown's location is not quite as bad as she looks
The misdeeds are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe it.
As with Mr. Bean, nobody died, or was completely swindled.
And the antidote, as it may be, is to be delivered what Brown's naturally always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new fuss about political donations is a good example.
The garboesque of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but he was not entitled to make up the decision.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who he says, known from Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial collectors, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing that suggests that he knew about these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after taking office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping for a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry, to make the measure full, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "exceeding lessons" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.
That said, Mr Brown has other things to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and to move forward with a radical reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win voters back; and the only way to achieve victory is through incontestable integrity and solid competence.
Map sharks
Is the credit crisis attached to America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is ailing, the predators have set their sights on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of contagion of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumption loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both from and in the default rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not retractable or more than 30 days too late.
HSBC announced last month that it has withdrawn a 1.4 billion dollar fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit cardholders.
It is nevertheless too early to panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
An amendment to the American private bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn constitute a large part of the clay card losses; the number of applications (and thus default fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for borrowers worsen or not.
The industry also reports solid payments, which show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, expects that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the housing credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will stake credit debt, now that home loans are drying up.
However, card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital values, therefore falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
They can even be beneficial for the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease if real estate is less worth than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important under the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to stormier terms by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and completely reassess the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial adviser.
Even if a sudden crisis of deficit in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are significantly more real.
If lower house prices and credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British bankers found guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to justice for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of the financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their applications guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, to enrich himself at the expense of their employer.
The proceedings were scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing in court, Ewing Werlein Junior pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings, which lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation that was launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations against them in 2002 drew attention to Fastov's goal of investigating the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to conceal a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent enron industries who helped tear the company into the bankruptcy whirlpool.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its shareholding in its subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Koppers Control acquired the bank's shares in its subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely argued against Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars in Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others slain about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastov pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper sits a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was released on a large scale due to a 1 million dollar bail, which made it necessary to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, crumbled in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks no longer concealed the billion-dollar debt or make weakening enterprises seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is serving a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he died last year of heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that is change for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption, held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had set up exhibition stands, hoping to be interested in newly lost Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-coated car grilles that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange Porsche in the next stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's change compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money as Dallas in its heyday.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in droves, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian high-flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible freelance donors in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week attracted a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell high-priced goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by the New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes, Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second grade, which are collectively worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they pulled through the halls on Sunday night in eveningwear, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red-carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be primarily aimed at the new quarters, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for several hours to visit a busy warehouse that paved without running Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick Ice Cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and G&Teddy bears.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 Euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a trade fair stand by the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt painted, blue mosaic stone.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper Knuts."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years are old according to Russian standards) have already moved from cocky logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a retail show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists were pushing through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said that he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, who equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the President of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requests, had three car cooler grille for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which same chain arm tyres interconnected together, sold for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a four-substitute.
"The Russian millionaire, the ostrich leather wheels or an image of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone booths based on the British model, which were crammed with mountains of false million dollar squares.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the money crops, mobile phone photographs, while they sit back in the midst of substitute richness, snap themselves by friends, or just to take a few million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Scale surgery suspected in New Jersey at death
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Festival when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white cape cod continued two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the panel van approaching the medical viewer's panel car," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died of a trial carried out by an unauthorized, cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked in the home at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what Ms. Arroyo's death caused, and are hopeful that toxocological examinations, the results of which could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief from the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo was an assistant to the police director, Garry F, since September 2006. McCarthy, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and persistent," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a Wednesday phone interview.
"She was my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control mission, and that she is leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankov said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Ms. Walsh.
"It is an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3:00 in the afternoon in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared death on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have told little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to tell whether Ms Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a wilted rose bush stands in the tight front yard and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him navigate the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,'" he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates lead to the rise in world stock markets
The stocks jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts, were reinforced by appealing comments from US central bank vice chairman.
Stock markets rose in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the leader of the central bank, said that politics had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm annoying markets, given signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence had "some of the improvements in market functions vice versa away from the late part of September and October."
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and stabilize credit terms with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped to reassure Wall Street, with further bad news from the US economy, now that sales of US properties reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank that they would remove 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global workers, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for heavy losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage loan sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these locations will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index rose by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broad-grown S&P 500 index rose by 2,65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2 pounds, adding more than 39 billion pounds to UK standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the reappearance of credit pressures on the markets had been underlined after strong demand was awarded at a significant 4.7 percent three-month guarantee auction of the European Central Bank granted to European Commercial Banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to feed further capital resources into the money markets in London increased as credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" rates for loans between UK banks rose with 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, following a continuous increase since 21. November.
England confronted with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who should beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is here at calling at least under this special title, to help head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table from High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filled with applications for national voter positions, if not for some part-time.
Whoever does not get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pin exactly what allows a person to reach the tip of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where it is difficult to choose where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to be coming up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same may also be asked into another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good qualifications, who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricketer, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go under.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but there are opportunities for this too.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a lick and a racket has to get regular chances of order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selection is more complicated.
There were many who last season were better than, for example, when James Anderson was apparently playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind crashes into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-notch wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a viewing question.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it may make little difference after all.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at the time still fighting to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, was perhaps still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instinct and gut feeling for Shah's greater experience about Bopara's youthful enthusiasm follow after another discussion in today's network session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
His sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, speaks for his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, and only six of the years of age.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the polls as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating, which was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder has joy of life from Essex.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket ground and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he recently overturned a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and enthusiastically say, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he taps his middle speed with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit in with him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be good if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others hoping that the city would return to normal.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was busy with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiaite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia has helped drive Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the growing calm in the capital since the US force increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizens," who defend their neighborhoods in cooperation with the American military.
But more said that visa problems and caused loss of funds in Damascus were forced to leave home, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from sectarian death squads in the country.
"We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving any visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will fuel secondary tensions again and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one educational field does the Saarlanders push the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I yesterday to the 50th anniversary. Sometimes a non-sa-country known that we are not Frenchmen" - this slogan plagus the smallest state self-ironically to its 50th. Birthday.
France and Luxembourg play an important role in the educational system of Saarland, which is in fifth place in the educational monitor of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
The universities cooperate closely with neighbouring countries even from a long tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
But the state children also bring the Saarland in above-average numbers to the universities - many of them without a degree at the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at IW.
More than one in five young people is awarded their university entrance qualification at a vocational school, which means that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the national average.
The combination of professional and academic training is also comparatively strongly developed.
In terms of population, equipping with dual courses of study is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to campaign for engineering disciplines.
"We initiated a number of reforms at the general education schools after the first Pisa study," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
So that the children start learning earlier, the last day of kindergarten is free of charge - a model that now also copy other federal states.
Future comparative studies will only show whether the students' performances will improve sustainably.
At Pisa in 2003, the percentage of risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are making them more happening.
And for the annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign knowledge is not measured at Pisa - otherwise one could score in this area.
Because the language of the neighbours is mandatory at grammar schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez envisions the watches
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On the 9th President Hugo Chávez is turning back the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez becomes a joke in Spain.
According to a new law, the Venezuelan Official Journal reported that watches are set for world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by saying that the United States had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) on Wednesday (local time) the demolition of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not have relations as head of state or Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chávez, who is pushing ahead with a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil land have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The trigger for the dispute was the decision by Uribe to deprive Chávez of the mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia, who were concerned with the release of hostages.
Uribe had criticized Venezuela with his decision "in the face", Chávez criticised on Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new cell phone choling clay makes a sensation in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you say) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who had annoyed the constant interjections of the left-wing populist at the recent Ibero-American summit and had crossed it.
German threatens 2007 Lohnminus
According to a forecast, this year is threatened with a loss of real wages, according to German workers strong.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employees could expect less in the salary account in 2007 in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The prison is the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price supplements for food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New burdens could also affect employees in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year, is indeed right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed again to have to ask for loans or grants with the federal government was quoted asked by the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion in food and petroleum products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought: The European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices on the poles, as they also appear on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have been suspecting that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided proof - it tracked electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus is shooting at an altitude of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "primordial soup theory", lightning has given rise to lightning life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are said to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If ever there was life there, it must have been in very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times more dense than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the devil's twin on Earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a different development into such a completely different thing is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early nineties no probe has been specifically on the exploration of this planet since the early nineties.
According to the researchers, the latest research findings, which are now being presented in several "Nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed," says the Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the north pole, the researchers also found a vortex of clouds at the South Pole, which rotates even more quickly.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air streams in the winter earth's hemisphere, writes a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-innerest planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also known as a morning or evening star, circles around the sun in just under 225 days.
But it revolves much more slowly around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus hardly reminds of Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Waters accumulated on both of them, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's image and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the receipt of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but she protected Merkel from the accusation that she is planning a new policy to China.
"The Chancellor has not refrained from traditional one-China policy.
China knows that," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly revealed displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a row from the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union’s “showcase policy” in foreign policy.
After the receipt of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were strong irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries, according to information from SPIEGEL.
China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians receive the Tibetan religious leader in official capacity, Wen Jiabao affirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against rioting as in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not unload violence on the streets, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, rioters shot at the police with shotguns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful not to build up and hold our own explosives.
We have to take this seriously," he said of the "New Press" who appeared in Hannover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, the states and municipalities have already worked strongly to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not only affecting the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing its first successes."
However, it is too early for the all-clear.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street battles with the police over the past nights.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, however, demanded a greater integration effort by the Federal Government, Kenan Kolat.
Faced with the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migration background below 25 years is "above-average".
Above all, more training places must be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people prospects."
The chairman of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany more than in France, "a social control is held in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat warned, "But still we have to be careful."
The young people must be given "quickly the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet in the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were deployed, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and a few burning trash cans and cars.
Since the previous day, a squad of around 1,000 security forces has ensured peace.
The police will reach out for as long as necessary, announced Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
Around 80 police officers were injured in the night on Tuesday near riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the consequence, the unrest spread to Toulouse.
The riots were lit by a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the death of the youth.
In the realm of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor's unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content - and that nothing can be expected of herself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her desolate appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was a strong and lack of content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that it would finally have to be governed.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is focusing too much on foreign policy with an arlicit sentence.
This is provincial, she said, showing that she does not want to understand what the critics are all about.
In the Bundestag, it has recognizably documented for everyone how much their accusation is true.
There was neither concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a detached politician who flees into foreign policy and remains rough there.
Example climate protection: It commends itself without compromising on the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how the climate targets in this country are to be achieved.
In general, the self-praise - so much immodestness would have failed the CDU boss two years ago.
Now it clings to the phrase that the recovery comes to the people.
This damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than saying the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of low-income earners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for it.
It is significant how often she expects to be about the children's advance.
Merkel needs three attempts to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack division
In the Youtube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are making a hard exchange of blows - and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged on the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants," Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
He counters himself with severe accusations: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals," says Giuliani, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of having privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blowing to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favourite, the eight presidential candidates are taking advantage of the debate on CNN, above all, to discredit their opponents.
The self-made 30-second videos that Internet users have submitted via Youtube are hardly more than keyword providers.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq in the round.
Romney, too, is fully read the Levites from the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn as torture the so-called "water boarding", an interrogation methodology where drinking is simulated.
The reactions of the hall audience in St. St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium shall bring up cheer.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favourites lie.
"I was mistaken back then," explains Romney contritish and asks the base and television audience that he was still one of the advocates for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the lurch when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civil time
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidante Ashfaq Kiyani, thus nourishing international pressure, especially from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the state of emergency, which Musharraf on 3. November had been imposed.
Soon after his swearing-in, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand by the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with him weighed lawyers after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had all objections against the controversial head of state election on the 6th week. October dismissed.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in an attack on a military convoys in the northern tribal region of northern Waiction.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's supergroup of the seventies plays again: The three band members of Harmonia once again took their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
An exchange of a recording from her great time "Live 1974" appears to the revival.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The adored sensation then takes place in the form of three seed masters on the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, his cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius towers in a flower-white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, contemplated from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally blends to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
But one may reveal here: Targeted inquiries revealed that the name waved through the collective pop memory, but by no means so lasting, to miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German be allowed to celebrate its living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleading Krautrock was always considered more in England and America than in one's own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2003, people saw the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudatory speech, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later sat like an old buddle at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreigner is one thing.
The memory is overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio existed only two years and during this time also developed a much less power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped out briefly at Kraftwerk and then earned a reputation as a guitarist at New!, who was perhaps then the most radical German group.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile in Forst in the Weser Uplands.
There, in the Alte Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century. They lived as city-volavents.
Less ideological than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to become a nanny.
Rather in a continuous artist.
Allegedly, a pennacle of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art was also found in bulky waste.
Some of them captured Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so calm and modest the music sounded, the band suffered material trouble.
The collecting of rice did not serve alone self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-strong record setting how someone thinks to remember.
From Rother, there was the desire to force Harmonia and practice occasionally.
An important demand for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric sumpy and secured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessem live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of cultivating Krautrock as its very own German contribution to living music.
New! was excavated like Roedelius's solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Public subsidized, as part of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Brit, former punk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Moth.
With what the entire range of Krautrock influences would be outlined to the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills in the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's movement floats with the strangest sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse room.
The legend formation is used for projections of further black and white photos of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are returned to improvisation.
No longer, by gluing microphones to the organ and to the drums in order to elicit outrageous sounds of the instruments via self-made effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tinkerers who are deepened in the technical.
The choir of the house does not change that.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, feels and whispers under sound clouds, singing in a nice place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never a rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power plant) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who shouts "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia do not let it go of peace even now.
The most natural thing is still being thoroughly considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or give great lucky fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murder of Peace" two films are once again dealing with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and bullet, or they are too active.
Richard Gere cannot help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had recently lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and irrelevant roles in feel-good films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism were sifting to you.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes the hunted" (Why do the movie titles always have today always be as long and confused as train driving tariff contracts?)
He provides a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek portrayal: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has long done his best times, but who has still preserved considerable remnants of former charm as a ruin-like monument to his decline.
But despite this trump card, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murder of Peace", which also starts this week, continues only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Murderous Peace" you can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from Kosovar hedge shooters, whereupon one of them promptly falls in love with them.
Although it is to be welcomed that the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the mote-hearted film is all too quickly getting lost in big again and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be used to explore as an example, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three US war reporters who set out to track down the Serbian head war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are striking: Both small teams go into the forest to do something that the military cannot do and both times it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the drain when reporters succeed in what Nato, CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not managed in five years to catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to go to just revenge in the last five minutes.
This is so bad that one wants to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema logic.
The film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (it should be united here for once) not too intensively to pursue the persecution on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the good thing and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I see the swollen head veins compassionately, suggesting how exhausting it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such threshold heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq movies were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South African film.
Almost always applies: When a star talks around the trouble spots or minefields of the world, then something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all boundaries" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it had to pass for decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now, which are now considered to be classics, have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know today, where every mass murder comes to two screens at home in real time, it's also just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters' lack of supplies to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Maybe you should not want to be good if you want to make good films.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastically distant artist's view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "LempriÃ Âres Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he said: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
By Beust receives criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor's departure from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympic Games has met with fierce criticism from politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games by the water.
But von Beust warns realism about assessing the opportunities.
The Managing Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described on Wednesday as a renunciation "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed such great motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the momentum in sports policy would not be able to be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to encourage the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "emanating from a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Confederation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the marathon decision of the Sports Confederation, which was awaited at the beginning of December, for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic opportunities in the period yet intended by us until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not concealed for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympic Games over the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build an opportunity by buying the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application was also in contradiction to the statement of the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception for the General Assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There von Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 "not as a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD civil service accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he put on the Olympics card and excluded housing construction," said SPD deputies Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded integrated planning for the Little Grasbrook and a later use of residential use, the CDU had placed unilateral action on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics had a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg had failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
If you connect the terms Sweden and the wooden box, think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or after all?
Currently, manufactured wooden chests in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's list of works.
The majority of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of "type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago fueled the authenticity of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now becoming a sobering result: The six "Brillo boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably also the most of the a hundred types.
The prehistory is nested, a confusing concatenation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - presented hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these did not come (for cost reasons) by Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission to have a few Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden in 1968, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time were rightly included in the art and auction history as authorized as original Andy Warhol-Brillo boxes called "Typ Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than 100,000 dollars at auction.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only found in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg produced.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, head conservator at the Moderna Museet, in addition to the six museum's own Brillo boxes, also examined three from Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press chipboards were first primed and shelved, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a painting roll without a primer - it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's brillo boxes," says the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies/e exhibition material."
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "serious accusations" made in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have been enforced in relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers have given up who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under the use of tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Around half of them were tried on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly with around 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, had apparently defected to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops detained the district around the elegant hotel.
The President summoned an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government had called for large demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main venue of the attempted mutiny of around 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours because of the army refusing to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesman.
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to settle for a good ten percent share of a good ten percent and do not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase the investment in Freenet AG, it was said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The freenet poker, which has been going on for months and is unable to transparent, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch has held directly of 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will earn another around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
