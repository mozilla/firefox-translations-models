Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates deliver at the shoot with people photographer Tuan and defy wind, spray and rain like real professionals.
Watch the romantic shoot in the video:
DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil's comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that you get into conversation once, that you also talk to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Bild-Zeitung".
Despite the months-long debate about the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-time international Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a certain point that this would be the case," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, justifying this with the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football that "when you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I think it's a pity that this conversation hasn't come about yet."
Linz: Garden hut in allotment garden settlement burned down
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the allotment estate, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut on fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically completely and fire debris had to be cleared out to the extent absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged in a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire brigade, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live, as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see "Kissed Luckily" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she claims to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of trafficking children.
She provides no evidence for all this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan can be heard in the video as she follows the family further down the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and giving Lohan a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress then asserts how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What prompted Lohan to take this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This is the task of "Mascot" on the asteroid
The probe "Hayabusa2" was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It should approach the asteroid Ryugu so close that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it back to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of magnitude 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there is talk of at least 420 deaths.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest on the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now the two have reached an agreement.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the supervisory board, but he is allowed to remain CEO.
British Conservative Party Conference
Closely guarded - the party conference of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party conference is supposed to deal with foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of ex-Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplications for years.
Now they have come to an agreement.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on it this Sunday - whether it goes well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("He doesn't") - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
One week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" presents himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His fiercest rival is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" refurbishment takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force still exists," said Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens to the industry journal "Automobilwoche".
Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi's parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to discuss further this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust gas values after the exhaust gas fraud became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Currently, Chief Sales Officer Bram Schot leads the company as acting CEO.
Because of the changeover to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for sedans such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Schot is committed to electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations have already been made.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair in the coming year again for the office of DFB President.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning in the "Current Sports Studio" of ZDF.
You have to keep trying to get re-elected, that's what I'm going to do.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future project" after winning the bid for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016, succeeding Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for an initial full term of three years.
The next vote is scheduled for the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future European Championship chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB presidium.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the Presidium agreed that he would continue to advise in this role in the Presidium in the future and then, of course, be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could be his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player without a migration background should become integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, 'The topic is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work," said Grindel.
Lose weight properly with half-wise scales
I've owned a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but it's more for the sausages.
It doesn't say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
New signing Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points) signed from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his competitive debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the competitive debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best scorer among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg pro Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the most accurate shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings excelled at the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
The Braunschweiger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the Baskets quickly ensured clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the german-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne's city center had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Islamic association Ditib is criticized because it is considered an extension of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: stars, boos and moments of shock
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York's Central Park.
"Get involved wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also appeared on stage at the spectacle, which lasted several hours.
In between, however, there was a moment of shock when many spectators took the sound of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Panic briefly arose, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people down from the stage.
"No one is trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
If you wanted to get one, you had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were cheers and applause from the audience - boos, however, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Together with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, offending many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women, who say they have experienced sexual assault themselves, confronted him in an elevator on their way to the committee meeting.
"You are also welcome to come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the front row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about a disruption of the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action had caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He had therefore arranged for bodyguards to bring the man out.
Steffen Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or supporting or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a sensation.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials are still underway against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
That's how fresh and good-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by NDR is known for boozy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg harbor pub "Schhadfischposten".
Presenter Ina Müller toasts with her guests to some beer, some wine or even high-proof drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal interludes.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
But the trip to the far north did not do the Munich native any good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crumpled, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he just has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights, which he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And Spritz.
And leave out the round of eggnog that Ina throws at half past three.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the 43-year-old's face.
His fans posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably most expedient - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly drinking is not yet known.
But since she has been moderating TV fun at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
For a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and rubbish
The entrance to the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against rampant vandalism are being sought, but solutions are hardly emerging.
Broken glass, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished trash cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with seating to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for some time.
For the showpiece railway cycle path in Little Red Riding Hood Land a more than inglorious sight.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for some time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Cycling Advisory Board.
So far, there is no solution.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating area to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also introduced the topic to the local advisory board.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents around - the seating area is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often loud, but the feasts are also destroyed: posts torn out of the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop in the ocean.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting place for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned about the new Radstätte in Ziegenhain, which opens today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive."
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: "This may set the threshold much higher to attack common property.
However, this would require a police patrol to pass by in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen would like to see a development of the Haaße hill.
It must be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycle path so far one can be very satisfied.
There is still room for improvement in tourism marketing.
Our cycle path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany," say the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa to be an extremely critical danger point.
There is no turning lane to the Haaße hill.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family togetherness over coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who lived in Hiltrup for a long time, the nine from the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, explained District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have never experienced this in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters feel connected to?
Among the places, the Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were mentioned particularly frequently.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue the "Kö von Hiltrup" in his Schlager-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short breaks with short interviews with the performers or references to their work.
So we learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Franke was able to report from sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed a lot on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltrup gastronomy.
For the favorites of the jury, there was still something special - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup hit, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland pack": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and even sounded "really good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Stadtteiloffensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon to be very full Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: "Decrypto" in the Game Test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can only decipher - the old trick with the red foil - once you have put them in.
This ensures that the other side cannot read anything even by mistake.
On the cards, for example, it says from left to right: "1st Renaissance.
2. Windows.
3. Dice.
4. Fest".
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
Because it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2". Is.
In "Decrypto", it is not the terms behind the secret foil that should be guessed, but its encryption keys.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "fixed" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible not; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "toss" for the dice, "lots" as opposed to feast; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he paid attention at school and knows the fall of the window there.
So it goes round by round, team by team.
You don't know the terms of the other side - but you can put them together better with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
The descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The other players probably have to study it quite long and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But once you get started, you will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre leader "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game of a few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about victory points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, later he also attracted attention in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he clearly drunk did not comply with the expulsion issued by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention cell.
In a sober state, he must then also answer criminally for the use of signs of unconstitutional organizations.
Betriebswerk Pressig was home of the pusher locomotives
The locomotive depot in Pressig was the hub in the Franconian Forest for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history came to an end.
"When buffers banged on buffers, you could hear it all over the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the town and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
Then the brakes squealed and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railway.
Statements that symbolize Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere else in the Franconian Forest was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters in altitude has its apex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and pusher locomotives were needed in the past, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a locomotive depot with 21 engine sheds, apprentice workshop, catenary and railway maintenance department.
"The centrepiece was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
The Pressig locomotive depot, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a workforce of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for locomotives and pusher locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 wagons were still being shunted per month.
Parts of the depot were demolished in 1982 and the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that a better use of the location, also in terms of freight traffic, has not been considered."
At Whitsun 1989, the Nuremberg railway division celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig to mark the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the marshalling yard Pressig was history.
"The shunters and brake shoe layers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (AP) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing, as Julia Görges had previously done.
Kerber won the China Open 6-2, 6-2 against France's Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the world number three is either Yulia Putintseva from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6-3, 4-2 against Darya Kassatkina when the number 13 seed Russian retired.
The Swabian now has to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors noticed the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in its 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was well received.
21 copies by 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been involved since the very beginning.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and helped design flyers.
Once again this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss there will be a 70-cent commemorative stamp designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's poster "Betzn austanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high response to the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won over for the musical accompaniment.
Walking through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear to the visitor that the title "Windchime Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau, awaits the visitor on the right side.
It is a tree stump, brightened in color, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushes in the background, the object looks fabulously contemplative and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who prefers to dedicate herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts, moving in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colourful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "wind chime performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the people of Albachten also vented their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to resign themselves to the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bench in the Tinnenbusch they launched the MGV 68 Albachten.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," predicted Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was proved right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation celebration.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
It was an elegant ball, festive clothing had been requested beforehand.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as usual in the "House of Encounter", but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was announced: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln tightened the controls and asked on the dance floor.
It was a matter of honour that the singers of MGV 68 Albachten themselves let the voice sound.
In keeping with the occasion, cheerful songs were announced.
Almost set: "Such a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the "Rüdesheimer wine".
In allusion to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus", which is the Latin name for "hops", was heard.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at that time, was again sovereign.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said: "He has such an easy manner, it's a masterpiece that he does." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves as singers.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at his desk until three o'clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds will be used to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserves of USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring find their way really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or tailcoats, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really good.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we did make an impression," says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a belated birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was ticked off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it to the finish, such a game can tip over," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
"We are all aware of who is on the other side in such a derby.
That doesn't break our necks.
I saw really good volleyball at times," Annacker did not quarrel with the 0:3 - and immediately went back to business as usual.
Where the journey for the independents goes, seems after just three matchdays not foreseeable.
"It's simply too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one thing he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
It's not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball." In the fourth league, they no longer want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will compete in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the "dream ship".
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired perceived me at eye level," Keller told Bild am Sonntag.
At first, she was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it so much."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time could have been jealous, but "like many men, Hans shied away from talking about problems and feelings".
Keller had always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he did not want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in a good German: I have disguised myself," she continues.
She always had the feeling that "she was not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which in truth I never was, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time".
The day before the civil wedding, I sat crying in the dressing room and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively."
The moth, which regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ Zurich resort, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the glaring glow in which a green carpet on Sechseläutenplatz is immersed dazzles him unduly.
But it's just a film festival, where more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So he staggers across the square on this late Thursday evening to relieve himself briefly in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The public toilet on the ground floor of a new pavilion goes to great lengths to exude a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, it stinks to heaven in the men's oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have just been entertained at the best level by the opening film "Green Book" in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as they do every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to come up with with an article about this festival in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a ribbon around the feelers, which a fairy godmother has slipped to him, and two beefy bouncers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invitees crowd in, dancing to live music well after midnight or letting DJs set rhythms to which they shout at each other, and wash down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters await slurping mouths, next door the incomparable cured ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut open, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The moth studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If these are two separate instructions, he has made a mistake in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the housewares department on the upper floor, the winged man tips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the prize for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting said brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But between local celebrities, cash desk and kitchen items, a face passes by that looks familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost looking like a choirboy at almost sixty, is about to walk through the crowd.
He is not talked at, not gawked, at most you squint furtively.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as inhibition, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team's victory.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the dressing room to cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division club had defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Senden "devastated" after last-minute bankruptcy
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league team ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defeat". His protégés were "devastated" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had played - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long phases not badly, the Sendener.
Only the initial phase "we totally overslept", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The hosts quickly led 8:1, even the early time-out, which Bieletzki had taken, did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the deficit was only two goals.
Especially Senden's best, Marius Hintze, scored again and again in the phase.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized to 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a seemingly reassuring three goals (29:26).
And then?
The impartial intervened in the events.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well against seven men at the back and repeatedly threw on the empty goal.
But they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now we have to get a damn victory," said Bieletzki, who was completely served.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Hof district), the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a road on Saturday near Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers underneath were removed, as police and prosecutors jointly announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman may have been buried not far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the criminal investigation department Hof has been working together with the public prosecutor's office again intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, the investigators found an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün by means of a ground penetrating radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the place to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced in the course of the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers lurk on the net.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should rather use passphrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it does not hurt to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled an out-of-court legal dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also relinquish the office of chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German supervisory board chairman.
On the other hand, he is allowed to remain CEO.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the US federal court Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He had always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market and pay $420 per share, the financing was secured.
This would have valued Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Following the settlement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp's team 1-1 draw at Chelsea
Liverpool FC came to a 1-1 draw at Chelsea.
In the top game at Chelsea, the attacker, who had just been substituted by coach Jürgen Klopp, made it 1-1 (0-1) in the 89th minute.
After six wins at the start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remains third, the new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equalizer several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared after a solo by Liverpool's top scorer Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a shot into the corner.
Record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis after the worst start to the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United deservedly with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven matchdays only in the midfield of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against Valencia FC.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League match at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion thanks to goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new leaders.
"Let's Dance" juror Joachim Llambi and Mrs. Ilona separately
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhalin content) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, about the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
"Our clients have separated amicably and amicably," said the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to "BamS".
The most important thing for them now is the well-being of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his jury work on the celebrity dance show "Let's Dance" on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment programs.
Arrests at demonstration in Barcelona
Barcelona - At demonstrations in Barcelona, there were clashes with the police on Saturday.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of recent weeks, the GroKo receives several poll low blows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the Bild am Sonntag for the first time nationwide.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one point to 17 percent, the SPD gives up one point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lost one point and came to only 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, if the Bundestag election were held on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU together would receive only 43 percent of the vote.
This means that the grand coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently receive 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received a total of 53.4 percent.
For the other parties, the range is also large: The AfD, in several polls the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve a share of the vote of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The Left Party is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the share of the vote.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey commissioned by the BamS showed.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are in favor of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed significant losses in Merkel's popularity.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
Among Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Notice at Aldi: Price reduced for love happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic get-to-know stories - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place to get to know each other for great love.
Yes, that's right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the rooting table or your favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The app Tinder has the reputation of being less of a contact exchange, but rather a raunchy exchange.
We dared to test: How do women react if you don't beat around the bush for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood love story potential when the happiness of love is preceded by an out-of-sight-lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then also gets in touch with his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and company - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi branch to hope that she will find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic turkey meat".
For believing in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the campaign "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckel für ein Leben ohne Kinderpoliung".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as polio leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be contained by vaccination, as it says in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand calm for Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - BVB sporting director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop worrying about Mario.
This is not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said Reus, a friend of Götze, after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen on TV channel Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry in contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the football Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven't even talked about a treaty yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will certainly be a moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening on Sky TV.
Football: Bezirksliga: Researchers VfL Wolbeck's performance against SC Altenrheine is encouraging
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went hard with his own.
He was taciturn, the coach of the football district league team VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (internally) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, things are running smoothly again on Brandhoveweg.
Dewy proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only wafer-thin scraped past the promotion.
Yes, I am very satisfied with the performance.
"We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of", Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first period.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his retirement (17th), the substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost took revenge when SCA hit the Wolbeck box twice in minute 41 in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his craft.
After the break, VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters narrowly missed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes submission.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch missed the left side again a makeover.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer fell Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the hosts 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The fouled man himself stepped up and demonstrated his dangerousness at standards.
Westhues' thing with the right slipper hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area in the 80th minute unluckily to the hand.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to survive anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske had the winning goal in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe that would have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt win 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five matchdays - that could not be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure their first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting line-up for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after a pubic bone injury and should prevent the SGE from conceding further goals according to standards with his header strength.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, there was a drama at the airfield in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a lateral stop.
Police, rescue and fire brigade were immediately informed.
With a large contingent, the forces came to the scene of the accident.
As a precaution, the ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called.
Occupants only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four occupants were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of investigation.
According to fire brigade spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small incipient fire, which, however, could be quickly extinguished.
Allbright Foundation Report: Women Remain a Rarity on Corporate Boards
Thus, only 8 percent of the board members were female on the cut-off date of September 1, as shown by the report "The Power of Monoculture", which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will overtake them," said Wiebke Ankersen, Managing Director of the Foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
In comparison, the gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German listed companies is also solely attributable to positive impetus from companies in the index of medium-sized stocks (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 DAX companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
"I am sure that the DAX companies will recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signalled that they will continue to make no voluntary commitment to increase the share from "zero percent".
A different picture emerges for the supervisory boards: As of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited annually for the boards, a share of 40 percent would be reached by 2023," the report says.
Some even make lousy: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari earns the best.
The Italians earn 280,000 euros with every Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the noble providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
"Car Pope" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer has dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made in the first half of the year with each sold car 69,000 euros operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, comes only to around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on each car strong.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices averaging 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and earnings before interest and taxes EBIT of around 3,000 euros.

The tourist association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which henceforth take place every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible marched through the town to the fairground to the sounds of the marching band from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor Jürgen Schulz and Wine Princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already packed marquee. "To do something like this for 60 years - that's an incredible achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later toasted symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's great that so many have found their way to us in Abtswind". Later, "Die Troglauer" set the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the association had set the drink prices as 60 years ago in the afternoon on the occasion of the anniversary.
A festive evening for the 60th Wine Festival will take place on Friday, 5 October, in the Haus des Gastes, before the second round takes place one day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: Ambulance crashes into taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passer-by was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - preferably even save human lives.
Such a rescue trip came to a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an ambulance with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance car had run over a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and Martinshorn.
He then collided with the taxi at an intersection, which was driving on green.
The ambulance slid after the collision against a traffic light pole and a tree.
He captured the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Driver of the ambulance and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were seriously injured trapped in their vehicles and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another summoned emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn public prosecutor's office, are investigating who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United lose again, for Mourinho it is uncomfortable
After the embarrassing exit in the league cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU loses 1:3. The manner of the defeat is likely to be a talking point.
Emblematic was the scene in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3-1; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
Suspecting an offside on Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders stopped and left Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative culmination of an already inadequate performance over long distances.
Quite different is currently the mood at United's city rivals Manchester City.
The Citizens, coached by Mourinho's big rival Pep Guardiola, came to a safe 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the outsider's defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero ensured after a good hour and a double pass with the former scorer for the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer league leaders
Three days after the 2-1 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought his way to Liverpool in the Premier League a 1-1 draw against Chelsea.
As with the Cup exit, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the closing stages.
Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, narrowly missed the equalizer after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, by the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (at Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute on a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily buxed a feed from Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil scored his third goal of the season for the decision.
Arsenal moved past Watford thanks to their fifth win in a row and are now in 5th place, just behind great rivals Tottenham. Wolverhampton continue to leave a strong impression under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
Wolves remained unbeaten in the league for the fifth time in a row in a 2-0 win against Southampton and occupy 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting is unlikely to let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, starting next week, they will be presenting their innovations together with competitors from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a major role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, are nevertheless likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and, among other things, have their first purely electric models with them: The e-tron of the Ingolstadt-based company is to be launched on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart-based company in 2019.
However, both have already been officially presented.
BMW's iNext is not scheduled to launch until 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3 Series.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, more than one million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died in the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, there was enormous material damage.
After the quakes, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will rise significantly.
The figures so far come only from Palu.
But numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate divine service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists on Sunday with a team of helpers in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final divine service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the high-horsepower two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of the month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
Already from 10 o'clock the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First, the biker brunch was on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was given during the biker service by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical accompaniment was provided by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes rather poetic-calm tones," says Pastor Frank Schröder.
This, too, was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship yesterday.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonished spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg would leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples into the large funnel.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to see this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces, which looked a bit like shredded material, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the last step was no longer so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had already bottled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure chest" and presented the latest Federweissen to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also in the coming year, the home club will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the Heimathaus in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of action.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will go round the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season bankruptcy: "Crazy situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 pros around him and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive to see at the 1:4 (0:2) of the bottom of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team," said 96 professional footballer Pirmin Schwegler and added: "That's disappointing, of course, because you always take on a lot."
The still winless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) scored to connect, are at the bottom with two points and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators, who moved into the midfield of the table with seven points after the successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Roma.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessians on his starting eleven debut and could never be controlled by Hannover's defense.
The striker, who has been struggling for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was for the first time in the starting line-up of Frankfurt, who started swinging.
A header faked to the net by Lucas Torró (17.) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defence around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who was out at short notice.
The leadership for the hosts was almost inevitable and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defended corner, Haller extended by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to put his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who came from the French second division club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt stepped up before the break.
This time Haller passed to his striker partner Rebic, who skilfully refueled and gave 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his team and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageously forward, but brilliant ideas remained until shortly before the end, when at least the follow-up goal succeeded.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was for the Frankfurt against overwhelmed guests only show run, also Jovic scored a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Lord Mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of an audience of millions at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n in the last week with two strokes.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on 14 September or on the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, which comes from the 30-year war and on which, according to legend, a Swedish soldier is said to have shot.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
This developed into a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is still not finished, only the sanctuary stands, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite its importance for the Geisinger parish, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the feast of the cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic parish home.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will drag on until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
What is certain is that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become greater, but more has also been determined, which was only possible through the inspection by means of scaffolding.
The base plastering work has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped that a good half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulm's Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
At the inauguration meeting, all those present agreed that "a very special house" would now be handed over to its purpose in Münsterblickstraße.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller dormitory for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas were taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former officers' building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with Handycap: "The house was getting old and no longer up-to-date in terms of equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators moved in to demolish the house.
According to the architect, the new building should be designed to be as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications, which allows the residents to experience the freedom to move without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, expressed herself similarly: "The house is geared to the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile".
The cosiness and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this location is a real stroke of luck, because it can no longer be purchased in today's situation".
In total, the new dormitory in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to collective bargaining agreements.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Berlin -- Before the Day of Unity, the deputy SPD federal chairwoman Manuela Schwesig has appealed to all compatriots not to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work on average longer than people in West Germany, but receive 15 percent less salary.
"Almost 30 years after German reunification, I can't explain that to anyone," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Will this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs as a gift.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two approximately one-year-old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed, therefore, the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals to settle in".
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national treasure of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The North had announced the friendship at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pyongyang.
The two countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly bid to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's eventful history as reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published that answer this question, mostly looking back on the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, takes a completely different approach in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to the substantive work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition starting today.
There is hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and CSU have not recently invoked a mantra-like "return to substantive work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and non-manual work, but so be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission - governing - it should not be prevented from doing so with debates about terminology.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of recent weeks will probably already show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts at an early stage; a lesson from all the controversy.
For the time being, however, conflict-prone topics are again on the agenda with the diesel retrofits and the Skilled Workers Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get off lightly with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While a rapprochement has emerged over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the CDU/CSU and SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled worker immigration law.
The SPD calls for a perspective to stay for rejected asylum seekers who work or are undergoing training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of lane" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not Gleich und Gleich has joined forces to form the GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different social images and priorities.
Quarrels are good.
Without dispute, a society marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons on the question of to be or not to be.
This is still about politics, not theatre.
The CDU/CSU and SPD should argue – but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain trust.
Above all, this is what the mainstream parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sights
Is the Minister of Labour violating the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
"Really day and night" their legislators had worked on the social security reform, reported an exuberant Minister of Social Affairs at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of List-Pilz representative Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) meets with astonishment - she brings the matter now via request in Parliament.
She assumes "that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the commitment of her team and under no circumstances wanted to announce violations of applicable service law in front of running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "absolve Hartinger of any suspicion."
Police tear open a street in search of a woman's body
Marxgrün - For a long time, the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, digging has been going on on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
This was preceded by the fact that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant spot to a few meters together with its handler in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said stretch of road.
For more than a year, the public prosecutor's office and the criminal investigation department in Hof have been working on the missing persons case.
Again and again, a cycle path was closed at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that Heike's body could have been buried here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - On the eve of the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes broke out between separatists and police in the center of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with paint powder, among other things, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to hold a rally to honour their colleagues who were on duty at polling stations last year during the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
The attempt to prevent citizens from voting had also led to violence at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central state security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break through the police chain by force, and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people had been arrested, 24 others had been slightly injured, it said, citing the authorities.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secession the prosperous region from Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under receivership in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also fled abroad.
Several ministers of the former regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, however, are still in custody.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the receivership was ended.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate goalless
Rot-Weiß Ahlen continues to tread water.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only enough to a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, they turned out to be the last and the third-last as gathered helplessness.
The first half was very manageable from the entertainment factor.
Those who preferred to get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without worries.
There was no danger of missing a scoring chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh's Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity had the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the edge of the penalty area to a parade.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed from 18 meters just over the box and after an hour, the Gütersloh team also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz it went fast.
Nick Flock (62.) "crowned" the swift counterattack via Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they added with a header from Wieckowicz (66.) after a corner ball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative could not be achieved by the Ahleners.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but even that brought nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positives: "I like that we played to zero". But unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"This time we weren't as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's interim coach.
Offensively, "everything splashed a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't have the feeling that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, as a spectator you did not have the feeling that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
This pleases Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabestelle, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations will also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a bit empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because: "It's so sociable here, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a good pinch of humor.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in at short notice for the Brockmanns, who were supposed to be weighed against food.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "substitute" did not miss the opportunity to musically entertain the increasing number of visitors.
This was so well received that some folk songs were sung along at a late hour.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer happily.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased about the many active people with their stands, most of them clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be such a thing as a blackboard," he thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of everyone who was at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "clean up" campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful coat of paint - here is something.
Then the May wreath was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
At many stands was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to savory, everything was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his scroll saw.
He had veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and much more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in a jar, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to grab it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Graffiti with local political message: No successful advertising for skate park
In Lengerich, unknown persons have advertised in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate park.
In several places there are corresponding graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for damage to property.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" are emblazoned in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the career choice fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with an Edding at the time, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, however, it was there again, this time sprayed on," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case is given a special touch by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are named on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city's Department of Schools, Sports and Culture, without naming names.
It is quite possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate parks.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
The Council finally voted by a majority in favour of the fire brigade parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a U-turn followed.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the site of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council then has the last word.
He assumes a decision this year, so that with a positive vote 2019 could be built.
Air traffic control bottleneck gets worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the chaos of European air traffic in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then comes the storm," said the head of the union of air traffic control, Matthias Maas, the German press Agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staff shortage at European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and the airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new controllers takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
Throughout Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been swept empty.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, for monitoring the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, the federal states, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work intensification and overtime, it will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members in the state-owned German air traffic control.
Maas once again blamed EU Commission guidelines for the pilots' misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air navigation services services are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that "do not further constrict the air" for air traffic control.
Currently, the EU requirements are coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years," Maas said.
He hoped that the high delay costs for the airlines would initiate a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact," Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary increase in personnel is not yet associated with this.
thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board approves Group restructuring
The members of Thyssenkrupp's Supervisory Board voted unanimously in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp's interim CEO Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at Sunday's meeting, the crisis-ridden group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will be headquartered in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body has only eight heads on the capital side.
On the other hand, there are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
Among other things, the new thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50 percent stake from the merged steel business with its Indian partner Tata.
The second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to bundle the elevators and supplies business.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan pro-independence activists.
At two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police had tried with a large contingent to keep the two protest marches away from each other.
According to the forces, independence advocates tried repeatedly to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
There were also scuffles between the participants of the various protest marches.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who had taken action almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators saw it as a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez to AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they throttled us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only as Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to assert our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona, because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
He and his colleagues, however, "did not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Breakdown allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A security breach in a mobile app has led to the personal data of ministers and MPs of the conservative British Tory party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown persons after the glitch became known a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
The Hanover police reported on Sunday morning a serious traffic accident on the federal highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people were killed when they drove their car into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champions' 3-1 (1-1) victory against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good on our first goal - and from that moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three assists, Juve turned the game around after the early deficit through Dries Mertens' goal (10th minute) and left their closest rivals behind for the time being.
The striker brought in from Real Madrid first put on the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided with a double (26./49.) for the lead.
And Ronaldo also did the groundwork for the goal of defensive boss Leonardo Bonucci (76th) after a corner with a header, who only had to push in shortly before the goal line.
"He gives a lot of assists," praised the coach.
But Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach said.
The best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the superiority of Juventus seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless streak in Serie A. With 21 points, the champions of the past seven years already have a six-point advantage over Napoli.
The runner-up coached by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the dismissal of Mario Rui (58th), who had already been warned, the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the pitch with yellow-red after boarding too hard against Paulo Dybala.
"We played well against a good Napoli," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel addressed.
The German international has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was in action in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flown off the pitch in Turin's 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday's home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, he should only be called "Ye", according to the musician.
"The creature formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince as he dropped his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is not news.
Already the tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'Ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'you,'" the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Managed!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more grippy, we hardly ever posed problems for him." The list of Hoetmar shot possibilities reads correspondingly thin.
Just two scoring chances in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Fußball-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar loses to SG Sendenhorst 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two opportunities in the first round, but Maik Krause used the first from an acute angle for an early lead (7th).
In the 43rd minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preparatory work by Krause he defended free-standing.
The hosts only had a double opportunity when first Moritz Höne failed to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper.
After the break, the visitors became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all forfeited.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the goal line with his hand and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line, the game was decided (81.).
"We had criticized each other harshly before, which was different today than in recent weeks," was Florian Kraus' conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh loses to Concordia 3:4
"I don't know what to make of it," he struggled for words.
"We didn't get access to them." By this he presumably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other Green-Whites, who attracted attention with collective offensive drive.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winked cheekily and then pulled away. His players, on the other hand, were relieved that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for relegation.
GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him with understandably mixed feelings.
"That was by far our best performance of the season," he says.
"How we come back from 2-0, how we hold our own against one of the top teams in the league throughout the season, that was really phenomenal."
This makes it all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he put on the left side exemplary for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"It was crazy what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own team managed the equalizer: McGill's free-kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through into the long goal corner (45.).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who scored the equalizer (59th).
After that, it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia goal (80th) again.
We must now concentrate fully on Wednesday.
"The game against Schapdetten, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights for point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: Entire Presidium of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire board of second division football club Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media referred in the evening unanimously to a joint letter of the committee of the Saxons.
A confirmation of the association was initially not available.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pomp
It's a good thing he's gone.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had said that he should not have been invited in the first place.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 conferences until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: As Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
This is how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have already been with us". The fact that celebrities appear again and again at the Academy in Tutzing Castle was also a topic at the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on 29 September the writer Frido Mann will attend a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: He wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy in person in Tutzing, which TV presenter Dunja Hayali also receives in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 conferences until mid-2019 have it all.
"The pension is just not secure!" is written in a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarism without limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea."
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academy Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions."
At a conference on the occasion of the 200.
Karl Marx's birthday in the near future, some expect more visitors in the direction of critique of capitalism, others rather a tendency "from the far left to the center".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner took on gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
At the grand piano sat Ben Süverkrüp.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes has his say until the end of the movement, and on the other hand, he is a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so congenially harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
That was also the case, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely in a way that suited the red thread of the evening.
Teubner had brought a paradox into play: The satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, brings no benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have sprung from Mozart's composing if "das Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G minor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, to the chansonette.
But the chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not miss an additional thanks.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must give up the chairmanship of the Board of Directors.
Musk also agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to pay a double-digit million fine, as the SEC announced.
The background is Musk's surprising announcement in August to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its lawsuit of having made false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police have corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
There were 10 instead of 15 passengers slightly injured.
All have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed in hospital for one night for observation.
He will be released in the course of the day, said a spokesman for the police.
Still unclear is the cause of the accident of the long-distance bus at Bruchsal.
The long-distance bus had crashed head-on into a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's national league: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen girls had problems especially with the third division player Carolin Stallmann, who alone marked ten goals.
"Actually, I was happy with the defence, only one player scored too many goals.
We didn't get them under control," said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed about the many missed chances.
The concentration in the final was missing his team this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end of a deficit, was at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
It was only towards the end that the wider bench of the hosts made itself decisively felt.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement on the left wing, who then "extremely cleverly scored the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
At the second division relegated VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won 3-1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked for that," said coach Dominik Münch after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the toppled league leaders.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the runner-up of the previous year.
Essen accepted in the two-bar, but did not come into play.
We kept them busy.
Our opponent hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, BSV already led 12:8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to three-man bars.
We couldn't keep up the impact pressure.
Food sucked in, and we let ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continues.
At 18:17 the volleyball players from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern fended off four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," said the trainer about the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly with their serves to the fact that BSV turned the tide in the third period from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue-whites round four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the german-Turkish relationship, which can only be swept together with difficulty," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"Instead of underlining the Muslims' belonging to Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the appointment for his own purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public had "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, it's finally folkmeeting time again.
On 18 October (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln organises its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost to the day, it's been a year since we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would never have thought that our Folktreff would establish itself so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether storm Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next Folktreff is, as always, a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites musician friends to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has confirmed with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he is on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folktreff fondly remember the last event in summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten thrilled the audience with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" and sent it home with a catchy tune.
"We expect many cheerful guests to spend another convivial and humorous evening," says the invitation of the home club.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always quickly occupied, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff starts at 7.30 pm, but doors open at 7 pm.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step forward on their way to becoming the world's largest industrial gases company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the billion-dollar merger is still pending approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA.
According to an insider, the chances of approval had recently improved there because Linde has agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Horticulture and Landscape Management was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On 29 September 1893, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set with a fruit show in the Kulmbach clubhouse, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach town hall.
Of course, it was still called differently at that time: It was founded by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893 as the "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land".
The purpose of the fruit growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit growing, nobody thought about flowers and horticulture at that time.
"At that time, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees were to line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which have almost 7000 members.
But this is far from exhausted the spectrum.
Near-natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as the transfer of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moles" showed how versatile the tasks of a horticultural association are entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said district chairman Günter Reif, and Lord Mayor Henry Schramm also emphasized how important experiences in nature are for life.
Chestnut collecting was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with smartphones & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"The district association decides where they should stand," added District Administrator Söllner and emphasized the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district was also left no doubt by district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the district association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was dozed off.
At the end of the 50s, however, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves on it," pleaded the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living in.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, added the president of the Bavarian regional association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canada's foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on NAFTA: You give both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech at the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today, Saturday, the Minister will speak on Monday before the General Assembly of the United Nations, said her spokesman Adam Austen.
In the meantime, she is focusing on renegotiating NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada's and U.S. negotiators would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the US.
In August, the US and Mexico agreed on a new version of the regional free trade agreement NAFTA.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they should now be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.
These are the most dangerous roads in Hanover.
The accident atlas of the Federal Statistical Office shows all collisions of 2017 with injured and killed in Hanover.
The most dangerous intersection is therefore the Königsworther Platz.
The city and ADFC want to use the data to make the roads safer.
Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo", the right-wing extremist ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil on the street.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "He doesn't"), women's associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations mobilized against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynistic statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As ex-mayor of the metropolis of São Paulo, Haddad has so far been far behind the right-wing extremist candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round, there will be a run-off election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge successfully from this – no matter against whom he competes.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said supporters of Lula's left-wing Workers' Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale just outside Paris.
The outsider team of captain Thomas Björn dethroned the favored defending champion USA around a toothless Tiger Woods in front of more than 150,000 spectators over the three days at Le Golf National with great shots and outstanding team spirit.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.
On his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 70s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything, but in everyone's heart."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 at the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger". The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a description of the rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock from three bands friends with each other.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of stage fright.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - loudly inspire the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the beginning of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the upcoming CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although "encore" shouts cannot be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hard rock is not just hard rock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" uses a synthesizer in addition to guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" captivates with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has gained a special reputation since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has special stage experience with their performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents in the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound, which feels even higher than before, running through the audience.
A certain volume is a genre-related part of such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the mixing desk team, the three-way concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is about at jackhammer level, but is still well below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", which "The Ignition" refer to on their website.
Deafening 120 decibels at jet drive volume as usual at the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the republic, the Ahlen audience does not need at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking pace have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
"Here we are, have taken the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups can say at the end, admittedly in the figurative sense.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
In the vicinity of the airport Mülheim / Essen it came on Sunday to a fatal accident.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reported, a glider crashed in the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reported, the flight student was alone on board - the plane should be a single-seater.
The aircraft had already been landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is not far from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend an Oktoberfest takes place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the outskirts of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the entrance to the Autobahn 52.
From the car park there is a Park & Ride offer at major events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga-Halle in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US president is well-disposed towards North Korea's ruler Kim despite the nuclear crisis.
Now, however, Trump has made a veritable declaration of love to his colleague.
This also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married US president has committed himself to a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half as old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although he proves to be a rather tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was tough, he too, and it was back and forth between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Ok?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne political fruit: Trump referred to Kim's announced stop to all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics have so far seen little more than lip service behind it.
The US president seemed to be well aware that the affection for the notorious "Rocket Man" - Trump's nickname for Kim - is not likely to be easy for everyone.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he cares very little, Trump explained and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: "I've always told you, it's so easy to be presidential."
But then we wouldn't have 10,000 people out there crowding into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Well attended, atmospheric and on top of that spoiled by sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's city center has dressed up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not only take place in the marquee at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile phone video to draw attention to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya and thus made their rescue possible.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July at the risk of their lives and distributed it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in mortal danger, according to his own statement.
One of his associates was beaten almost to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
IOM organises the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back home this year with the help of the program, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not unusual in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
From a call for help by mobile phone video, he had not heard so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely ruled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the vestibule of the 1st floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there via a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher called the police, who have taken up the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen cannot yet be said.
Perpetrator description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a wooded area in Middle Franconia after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance not far from a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He stated that he was now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a drive in his SUV across the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the whereabouts of the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has called for the rule of law in Turkey in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed," Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He had therefore made it clear to Erdogan "that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite."
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved at short notice to a building of the flight readiness of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Schloss Wahn – but the castle owners had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the meeting, Erdogan travelled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their point of contact - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime presents the situation more soberly.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for concessions from Washington.
At the UN General Debate, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
"The latest shutdown comes from the U.S. relying on coercive measures that are lethal to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could "bring North Korea to its knees" is "a pipe dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri emphasized.
From the US side, however, there had been no "appropriate reactions", criticized the Minister.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged in recent days at the United Nations for strict compliance with the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors to the HoT Open House did not notice that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came the nasty surprise on the first day after the summer break: A power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of order, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start all over again: We got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so everyone pitched in.
The result was impressive, the guests were thrilled.
"Chefs can't do it any better," praised an impressed visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to help themselves to quiche, meatloaf or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have achieved," emphasized Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW state board of the food bank
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his post in the national association.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a ban on admission for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as deputy head of the NRW food banks, said Sartor of the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many have stabbed me in the back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa understanding for the decision of his long-standing deputy.
The sharp criticism had taken Sartor with him.
"I can understand his step - people have expressed themselves who did not know exactly why the Essener Tafel does this".
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized in the "Welt am Sonntag" in turn criticism of colleagues from other food banks.
One should not pursue the approach that "without us, the people in the city will starve".
It is the task of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
At a congress of the food banks on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not participate.
"I'm told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis, who also criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch squander 2:0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after falling behind - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment at the Sportfreunde was great.
Quite different the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to win meanwhile with a 3:0
Gladbach squandered two-time lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals twice squander a lead.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first win of the season (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games, Schalke has maneuvered itself offside with early goals.
Now Domenico Tedesco's team has once again shown the strength with which it took first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf gave the home team the lead in the eleventh minute after strong work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, as a result the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had suffered a 0-2 deficit against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came in the 2nd half to a 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) equalised with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was substituted by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another double in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning glory of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also achieved their first victory.
Against Werder Bremen, decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgart had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal that helped the guests equalize in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led VfB to their first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also no unsuccessful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave up a lead, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's equaliser at 1-1 with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless on the Aargauer's flat shot from 20 metres, as well as on the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the foals' attack.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from OGC Nice scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh competitive game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach occupies 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered themselves into an uncomfortable situation against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counterattack, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to put his team on: The 23-year-old Serb conceded yellow-red after a jersey pluck against Daniel Didavi.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into the game with a curious throw-in own goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the outnumbered Stuttgart back on the road to victory.
Nuremberg won the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia today, around 1.8 million citizens are voting on whether to change the name of their country to North Macedonia.
A Yes vote could resolve the conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has been smouldering for almost three decades.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any rapprochement between Macedonia and the West.
The voters will therefore also decide on future integration into the West.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum was positive.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat up three pensioners, injuring them, some seriously.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted on Friday against 22 o'clock in the escape alley in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who attacked passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A little later, it turned out that the suspect had recently beaten three elderly ladies (65, 67, 75) to the ground with his fists in Währinger Straße at a tram stop.
In addition, he had trampled the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered bruises, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for unknown reasons," as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two tied the knot on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"When we get married, we do it right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is budget policy spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir on 30 June 2017 with an angry speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the citizens' association Kinderhaus and the Gesellschaft für Leproskunde.
Because about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the benefice house should be cut.
Supported by the residents, around twelve supporters went to work.
"We are doing this to reduce costs," explained Walter Schröer, chairman of the citizens' association.
And a lot has accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it is now only a topiary.
Because already in the spring you have sheared the hedge once.
The breakfast that always follows work also has a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Hannes Aigner from Augsburg won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe Slalom World Championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put in a perfect run on the Olympic course on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I already had enough rides here on the course and everything went well today," said the Olympic bronze medallist in London 2012.
At the finish he threw away his paddle for joy and stretched both arms victoriously in the air - knowing full well that it would be enough for at least one medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters could not beat his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police department reports the first burglary attempt this autumn in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that again.
Yesterday, the Gauting police department reported the first burglary attempt of this autumn.
The fact that the experiment at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße has remained is thanks to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday shortly before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they fled without prey.
Information to the PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: Caught up with reality: Bayern challenged against Ajax
The predicate unbeatable is gone: FC Bayern "does not want to put up with the defeat in Berlin".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac's tenure.
The first small dip in performance under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase for the Munich to the larger autumn low.
"A week ago you still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us," said Thomas Müller after the deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that's why we're stepping on the gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year away from home no own goal scored, as at the same time of the previous season two competitive games in a row without a win, the table lead in the Bundesliga lost for the time being to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as at the end of the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champions must still be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful pinpricks over the outsides have delivered two blueprints within three days, how the recently overpowering Bayern can be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we won't put up with it and that we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his hometown and blamed his first defeat as Munich coach only on the again poor handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim conclusion of his tenure positive before the international break - otherwise the tone is likely to tighten.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second Champions League appearance of the season after the 2-0 win at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, which had also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 at the start, begins as planned.
"Now we've been caught in two games, but we'll score our goals again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The right-back appeared in the role of admonisher.
"I don't think it's all bad luck, we have to work for it again because we don't make the multitude of chances and make the mistakes at the back," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh matchday of last season, Bayern were already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead again with a one-point advantage.
And so Kimmich assessed with a wink at least positively that now the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the international.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanently controversial topic of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association's line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was sharply attacked by Özil personally, announced consequences from the case in Mainz's ZDF "sports studio".
"In the future - because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this will not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel again declared that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they let themselves be photographed with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have risen to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to stand in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I very much regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil's return to the national team.
As a consequence, an additional integration commissioner is now to be appointed in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says: 'The topic is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local clubs, where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again next year for the office of DFB president.
"I do my job and strive to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg / Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-Year-old has caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of personal details, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a motorist who had gone off the road and hit a guide post.
When asked about this, the man did not want any police on site and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner got lost in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Eventually, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much.
The damage amounts to approximately 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency personnel are still on duty.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the moor fire on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 firefighters are still busy with the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
Since the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster was lifted, which had been declared a good week earlier on 21 September, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements through wind and flying sparks.
Thursday it was then said that a spread of the fire to neighboring communities no longer threatened.
At times, more than 1500 emergency workers tried to get the fire under control.
The German Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornadoes" are planned again on 2 and 5 October.
The fire was triggered by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
The plume of smoke from the moor fire had at times moved up to a hundred kilometres across northwestern Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that accepts damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the politician married his long-time friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Almost exactly one year after marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two tied the knot on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
When we get married, we do it right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is budget policy spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had caused a stir on 30 June 2017 with an angry speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the issue.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said, alluding to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in adoption law.
Referendum in Macedonia on new state name started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
Because of its northern province of the same name, neighboring Greece insists on this.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the starting signal for their country's integration into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the USA in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland is launching an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved by Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the decisive moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to decide vicariously in the interests of the deceased, which is often very stressful," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to save information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal center for health education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken out in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, anyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless he or relatives object.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
He prevailed against 39 competitors in Wolfsburg at the weekend.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was already there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or child prodigy, organizer Laue can do little.
"Mental arithmetic can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-based arithmetic competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, square root drawing from six-digit numbers.
In eventing, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they have to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here, the Germans would also have good chances, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians often have an advantage because mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer screening
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her soulful and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to use this video to draw attention to breast cancer and advocate early detection.
It is a matter of life and death, but also of courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings topless the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover her most intimate parts.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which focuses on breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams herself almost died a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the life of the baby.
In a subsequent CT scan, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna – The German government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbols law" for review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mother Hulda shakes out her beds for the first time next week in the West: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow line drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow at high intensity down to about 1,000 meters, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimetres of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 metres.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlberg Pass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) the road conditions are therefore wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start their annual kink care on Monday.
The "green walls", which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the sparsely forested federal state for around 200 years.
The up to five meter wide trees and scrubs are "forest substitutes" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also provided the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
Its name "Knick" also comes from that time: by "twisting" the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometres of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7000 animal species as a replacement habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometre of bend and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is cared for accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, it atrophies to a light row of trees, which loses not only biodiversity but also the windbreak effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
In an interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Were you there yourself during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes came, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that relief supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills, where they still hold out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are sometimes free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information supply on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people of whom they do not know if they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know why, but when the all-clear came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran into the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo suffered a torn muscle fiber in the back of his left thigh in the 2-1 win against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga club said on Sunday.
In the case of Donis, the doctors diagnosed a torn muscle bundle in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a prognosis for downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The San Sebastián Film Festival closes the series of the most prestigious European festivals every year.
Despite all the hymns to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong entries from Europe and Asia and a Venice that attracted a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions of recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers at Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water guard station.
To help the animal, passers-by called the police and the fire department.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the emergency services again and again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to encircle the animal and push it back to shore, where it was then put into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a courageous grip.
The duck, which was injured in the chest, was then taken to the veterinary clinic of the LMU in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial assessments, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard aims for World Championship medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was in biathlete Julian Eberhard's stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to make up for the missed precious metal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old the medal within reach in the Olympic sprint in Pyeongchang.
In the end, seven tenths of a second were missing bronze.
"I deliberately took my time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn't want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up on the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to get back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Championship trail in Östersund (SWE) suits Eberhard: "I've already taken the track to my heart," he remembers with joy his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) last World Cup winter.
With the relay he ran in Oslo (NOR) in second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at turbo speed
Time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is severely limited.
With an FBI investigation at turbo speed, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the wafer-thin majority for the controversial because of coercion allegations judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline of Friday to investigate the alleged incidents dating back more than 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's appointment, accompanied by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer uttered angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge on the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had described the heavy accusations on Thursday as "shit", initially abstained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of "luck in misfortune".
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for opposing Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known allegations of two women, nothing more, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They do not go on a fishing trip".
According to the "New York Times", only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a "civilian vehicle" by the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
The Federal School Centre is also located there.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You could feel the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty area," said the sporting director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relief.
Finally, the Royal Blues had managed to bring the narrow 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first victory of the season under wraps.
It could actually have turned out differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security: "All in all, the first half was good, both playfully and in terms of pressing", the head obviously played a role more and more with increasing playing time.
Schöpf actually no header monster
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
"A huge stone fell from our hearts," said Schöpf, who played a significant role in this with his header: "I'm actually the worst header player in the game."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was palpable throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the early stages and make fireworks out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and bravely, so we have to approach games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to provide.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the bar twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shaky victory," said Tedesco: "You could feel the fear a bit."
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalke.
Fischbachau: Column of smoke visible in the Leitzach valley 2 km
The smoke could not be missed.
From a distance of about two kilometers, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzach Valley on Sunday around 1.30 pm.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the embers unattended.
And that's close to the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
The police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them stands the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He once again accepted the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my mission, for many years, to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very casually, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible figures and one or two jokes, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflict-ridden topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly arising despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first-generation migrants at the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
This leads to conflicts.
The decisive factor is therefore not whether one classifies oneself politically to the right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, then the discussion round starts more and more actively.
And there is a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among pupils.
El-Mafaalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent book signing, he still had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, intensive discussions continued.
Basketball: Bonn and Giessen win opening matches
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first matchday of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Giessen prevailed in a hard-fought game in their own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
First league leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champions Bayern Munich and the former series champions Brose Bamberg had much more trouble at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80 on Saturday.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is obviously huge: More than 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the plots in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots of land in the new development area Landsham-Süd on the open market.
This is announced by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at more favorable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model - has been completed.
A good 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" with regard to application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, the aim is to have created the applicant ranking list for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to submit it to the municipal council.
After that, the award could take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and semi-detached houses will be created on the site in the south of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses, each with an expected eight residential units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be asphalted soon.
A single plot of land and two of the apartment buildings belong to a private individual, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots of land in a socially acceptable model.
According to Frick, the municipality's two apartment buildings are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments subsidised by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Roughly estimated, living space for about 200 people will be created on the area of the new development area Landsham-Süd.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start of the construction of a new daycare center is taking place there.
It will house three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalke's Naldo achieves "great sport" on the bench
Not in the starting line-up for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had sat for the third time in a row not in the Schalke starting eleven, but on the substitutes' bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had really talked the frustration from the soul.
But when the Schalke players gathered as usual in the centre circle after the 1-0 victory over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for simplicity's sake, intervened and said; "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction of his vice-captain, who had no grudge despite his renewed reservist existence.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalke last season, knows that he has actually not been sidelined by his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I'll tell you honestly," Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo he wasn't in the starting line-up.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can catch their breath at the moment.
And that we keep everyone on board," Tedesco explained the rotation, which recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its downward slide in August at an accelerated rate compared to the euro zone.
The purchasing managers' index (PMI) was at a 37-month low of 46.7 points.
Nevertheless, Austria has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in response to its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-point mark for the 13th month in a row, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Bringing up the rear were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the sentiment barometer fell, albeit more slowly than in previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened downturn could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains the number one brake on growth - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to growth is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell more sharply than at any time since November 2011.
As a result, companies cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The sentiment barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers' Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, inventories and prices are surveyed.
Tuchel's PSG team achieves eighth win in eighth league game
29. September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel continues to rush from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At OGC Nice, the defending champion won 3-0 (1-0) thanks to two goals from superstar Neymar and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France was 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar gave PSG the lead after 22 minutes and made the final score in injury time.
Christopher Nkunku (46th) provided the interim 2:0.
Paris also managed the dress rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the premier class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only competitive defeat so far this season at 2:3 in Liverpool.
