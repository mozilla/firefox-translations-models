Schools encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to cover at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
"Unseen texts" are also included in the exam in order to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
As of 2015, students will be required to take a stand-alone GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the exam regulator, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence," stressing that GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for math in the timetable, coalition sources say the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will likely encourage schools to schedule more hours.
The curriculum pays more attention to "real-life problems," including financial mathematics.
Rapist in South Africa: two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died as a result of the serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act had triggered nationwide horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so horrific that the nurses and nurses needed psychological support.
Kana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: every year there are about 64,000 reports of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, which, with 82 million people, has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa, however, estimate the number of unreported cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable owl because he has decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt cannot be dissuaded from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he crosses by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there will be coffee, tea and cake.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in suspense.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of minor and major glitches at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent masses of erroneous buy orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through the orders and cancel them.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the U.S. came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer glitch on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Facebook's IPO also caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later determined and condemned the company to a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is basically willing to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to have his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the US in an unaddressed letter, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor General.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the responsible persons
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to work as a technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a serious and ongoing incitement that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, as well as high officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations of an all-encompassing surveillance system accountable to no one as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these lessons learned are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted were visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my administration continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and lawfully in clarifying the facts of the statements made in the media, particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Driver who raced between legs at 210km/h and hot drink gets £1,000 fine
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 210km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and a £100 victim supplement.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill Spielkamderaden with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they played football in front of their apartments in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, whom they had taken, was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the course of events to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted to the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was provisionally committed to a psychiatric juvenile institution.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian airbase
An American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airbase in Latakia, Syria, a day earlier.
The target was "rockets and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanon's Hezbollah, CNN said.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arabic channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on the night from Wednesday to Thursday, blaming the Israelis.
Israel's Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base showing Russian S-125 Neva missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads weighing up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack, but was not certain.
In any case, a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried before, sometimes successfully, to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
Journey through mud, rivers, and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote him "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but then inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be first, and yet you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country's healthcare expenditure is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer made Bwelle decide to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and drive with the tied medical equipment on the roof over dirt terrain to the villages that need help.
Things don't always go smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed like heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his big smile and boundless energy – likes to be part of the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — a document required for school, but many poor families simply can't afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; After the procedure, patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operating room and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a strenuous workload, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries in the last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a hernia he had received now allowed him to return to work.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is in her sophomore year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
"We can be present at surgeries where we help dab blood or mistake the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's a hero without a doubt," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others live happier lives and fulfilling a promise he made to his father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 "cardinals entitled to vote".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, would be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistory in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be scheduled," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote will likely have dropped by February.
He explained that a pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals eligible to vote would again be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory is significant because it is the first since Francis' election in March this year, Valero said.
Currently, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven't been in this situation – it's all brand new.
Valero said that typically bishops from large places are called to cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises – so we don't know who he appoints."
Worker fell from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a defective external sensor on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outer façade of an inn.
When he climbed the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken by rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg State Hospital.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing business together and defining what those who provide wealth and jobs in the UK want to change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, who roughly represent UK company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want governments to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than dwelling on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's obscure institutions.
When asked for their views on specific legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe control of these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies said the cost of Brussels rules now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40% of large companies, which are traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
Finally, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wants Britain to change the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that business is pushing for "meaningful change" that will bring the reins of action back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the British economy stands behind his plan to renegotiate the UK's terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to significantly shift the balance of power back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for businesses an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' approach to regulation.

Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over a period of three winters.
"What is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained specialists, who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are also involved in the project.
Dog lovers successful

Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the critical gaze of the judge with her Woody in class 1.
GM Recalls New U.S. Pickup Trucks to Repair Seat Back
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, according to a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Agency on Friday.
On some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not meet the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit from behind, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US automaker since the bankruptcy-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, newly developed for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silver and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Mother buried in the forest and pension collected
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old man from Wolfsburg buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he pocketed the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-Year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, it was noticeable that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for them.
The 67-Year-old had finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.

Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling brake trucks with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 pm.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have a Swabian touch at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It's not about the distance," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown vertically, should roll over once and then come to rest straight.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, accuracy is crucial.
From a distance of eight meters is thrown at a stake.
The participants have to prove their skill and strength when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
Two from each "clan" or team may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 o'clock.
Suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in a tartan skirt.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, brass band fans get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m. the Biraböhmische brass band from Schömberg will provide the big entertainment evening.
The band plays brisk polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen unter den Rinnen, known as a singing innkeeper and black sausage baron, will be there.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for a morning pint, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "oldies" then end the festival.
The kick-off is already on Friday the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other items on the programme on Saturday and Sunday include the classic car and tractor meeting, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other Sunday attractions include the corn maze, artisan market, and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask oneself: What is stopping parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" read the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive and we oppose it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which owns CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government is "effectively strangling the media" with the new law. By contrast, The Standard writes that democracy and free speech in Kenya have suffered "a severe blow" and called the draft "draconian".
The bill's passage is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities for releasing footage from security cameras showing units sent to the scene allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, although the summons was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists can face up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being banned from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations."
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they wanted with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial controlling factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to their own devices, they will bankrupt the country and take us back to the time of hunter-gatherers," he commented.
Kenyan legislators have drawn public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the national remuneration commission and reinstated their hefty salaries of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-free – among the highest in the world.
2014 will be Geisinger Festive Year
Das Jubiläums der Stadt Geisingen anlässlich der 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen had their first documentary mention in 794.
A document was made in churches in which both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official prelude to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen celebrates its 1250th anniversary in July on a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festival weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the solstice celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the Stadtmusik in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger town anniversary, a new chronicle is also published.
"However, it should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the Geisingen of today celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 today's region was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has the festive banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen had its first documentary mention in a deed of donation owned by the Abbey of St. Gall in 764.
The document was made in Kirchen (Hausen), which was then a court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250th anniversary in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is 40 years ago.
Also this year, on the name day of Saint Hubert, a Hubertus mass will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubert was a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn group of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on par force horns (natural horns in the mood E-flat) according to old, originally French melodies.
The brass players wear riding clothes because they mainly musically accompany riders, horses and packs of dogs on drag hunts.
The solemn mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care bill
It is a major victory for the Obama administration: The US Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law, which is closely linked to Barack Obama, is constitutional.
By a vote of five to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which forces U.S. citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional within the scope of the state's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page bill and also held that the health care law's requirement that states either expand Medicaid eligibility requirements or remove all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill was strongly opposed by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the club was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former mayor of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work in an advisory capacity at the association.
In 2008, the carpentry Schleeh from Baiersbronn built the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity hospital in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many trips as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to sit in on various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling stories from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, during their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivations, he cited his work in the field of auditing as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also emphasized that global economics also requires global philanthropy.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is about to be renovated, is to be put back on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angle wall was installed with balustrade to stabilize and statically relieve the over one hundred year old natural stone wall.
According to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlingen city building office, the further procedure is to involve the State Monuments Office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which is then to be put on the table of the municipal council for decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school, built in 1912, the boundary wall, which is in need of renovation, must be completely renovated and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is in need of renovation, especially due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, and has an arch inclination to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not in danger of collapsing.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was even planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a postponement.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be the State Monuments Office.
Should specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the preservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management announced via the short message service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media also reported several injured.
US President Barack Obama will be constantly informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and children cried.
Panic broke out among those waiting, many hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the "Los Angeles Times".
An employee of the security authority TSA had suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have been fired near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
Television images showed numerous ambulances and police cars pulling up in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building to safety.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special task force and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were closed, which formed long backlogs, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, CNN also showed several planes taking off.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
LAX Airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are less than 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall traffic light.
Two plants so close together: intention or prank?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall traffic light was installed at that time because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclists and bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light had to be installed for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg District Office.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy goods vehicles," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety simply comes first," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also considered, but rejected because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when choosing the location of the traffic light masts: "By means of a transporter loaded especially for us with particularly long logs, we have determined whether these vehicles can exit from Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without buckling the traffic light masts".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is the "most modern thing currently available on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be easily seen by motorists, for example, even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems in each direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, there is immediate green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for pedestrians.
"If a group or people with walking disabilities cross the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone can cross the road safely," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver must think along as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: As soon as the traffic light showed green for pedestrians, a luxury vehicle rushed through - in bright red.
Perseverance pays off
Six men's teams competed in the tennis tournament of the clubs for the winner's title.
In the end, the perseverance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with everyone playing against each other.
The game was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter directs the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were level on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the challenge cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the home straight.
Second place went to the doubles Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze podium was achieved by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
With late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful end of the tournament took place.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea oil rig released
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea oil rig, was released back into the wild.
The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was nursed up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, held up by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He could no longer fly on, which is why we were contacted with a request for help."
When she was released, the water rail was fit and healthy again.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which zigzags over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, the authorities said.
When the tunnel was discovered, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were seized, according to the court's records.
Three men, who authorities said worked as drivers, were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, they face prison sentences of between ten years and life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing the challenge for drug cartels on how to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could undergo 'authenticity test'
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers on 457 visas as part of expanded measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was published today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers for being perceived as offensive by Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements such as 'foreigners should queue up' and 'hire Australians first' are a very unpleasant relapse at a time when trade unions were calling for a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region heard an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers ended up hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The distraught nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian town makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Due to the low level of sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks into the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers moved sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety's sake.
Until now, sun-seekers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea had existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (around 615,000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella for several years.
The CDU/CSU and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of the interior and justice.
For this purpose, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery of members of parliament and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its deliberations.
Among other things, it is likely to be about the issue of dual citizenship, on which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD underpinned its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his parliamentary group.
There was a threat of evasive traffic on country roads, which were already accident hotspots.
From Pronold's point of view, the introduction of a toll for all cars would only be a first step.
"There is a danger that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the dump.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also focuses on wind turbine logistics.
The coal on the storage site in front of the dike shimmers black.
Two huge blue tailings pile loaders and return chargers distribute or load the coal here as required.
With every movement of the handling equipment, a shrill warning sound sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this can be heard far and wide when the wind is unfavourable - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and have therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, they are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with neighbours in the future.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the major players in this sector in Europe.
Thanks to the bassinet in front of the terminal, which is recessed to 18.5 metres, Capesize bulk carriers have long been able to be handled here.
"This year, we want to break the 3 million ton mark in throughput," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF Suez power plant were to be connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private individual.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed hands at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is entitled that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier happily.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, there was something magical about Halloween.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween grouch.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I probably won't do so this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans — 158 million, to be exact — are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody tempting food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I'm expecting tons of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft punk space men will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my amazement we were not alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of "hot dogs".
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who march through the neighborhoods with the slogan "trick or treat", according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's not kid ourselves – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn kernels.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses that are haunted.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos of you peeing in your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook where you can't get rid of them, and then the guy you're into.  leaves a comment like "nice facial expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from an early age.
Luckily, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin rather than sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, is believed to be from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you really want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921-pound pumpkin.
Pimp must go to prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the district court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
Accordingly, he has met women in five cases through Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent after a few weeks against their will on the line.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He withheld the income of the women, some of whom had been buying for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he prevented women from contacting the outside world.
Together with a colleague who placed the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored in order to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the mental limitation and thus about a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first complaint through telephone surveillance measures.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had discovered bruises all over her body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality" who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this profession.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had freed himself from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
The former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption regulator.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime lease arrangements at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated over the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out in favour of public tenders.
But he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government's lease arrangements.
A telephone transcript submitted to ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
NSA revelations increase company paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the US was not using foreign espionage "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could enhance their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the former employee turned whistleblower, began publishing his cornucopia of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.
The last straw was the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has so far been no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major shift because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S. members discarded plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, vice president of SAP, says: "We're seeing a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago – is: Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders argue that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore be guarded at all costs.
That industrial espionage is taking place is no surprise.
This has always been the case.
"It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Management usually doesn't brag about the countermeasures they've taken, because that gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick with them at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unguarded in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect cell phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
Germany's BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones can potentially be compromised.
The prepaid mobile phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorised access," warns the BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against industrial espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia and Israel second only to China among the countries that used the hack to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to industrial espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's internal intelligence agency, the DCRL, was quoted as saying in an interview this month: "The intelligence agencies know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies."
When the horse show experts gathered in Cardiff in droves to choose the Horse of the Year, they knew that a tough competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The toddler, who is not even in kindergarten yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony Toffee trotted easily through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural skills in handling the pony, which were far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the field with a gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been demonstrating horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered him on and clapped him."
He walked on sand the entire length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, it won't be long before he's on the Horse of the Year show – and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesperson for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The judges judged Fenton and Toffee on how well they performed and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes did their part, it really suited the occasion perfectly.
Care day at the small Englishman's hut
For the fifth care day in the wake of the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut free in the area of the hut on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the Schluchtensteig, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the care day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourism aspect, ecological consideration could also be taken.
Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Regional Council of Freiburg explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the campaign a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the Weitblick coincides with the goal of preserving the now heavily overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure not only fits seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere reserve also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these different explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, the forestry tractor was available if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was a clear view at the viewpoint.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a snack.
In the past, the elderly citizens were entertained in the service area.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with popular melodies.
Königsfeld: Small team does well
The volunteer fire brigade mastered its autumn main rehearsal with flying colours despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder property in Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There, a short circuit is said to have occurred during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer's first examination of the situation, two people wearing respiratory protection from the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and escort him outside.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales stored in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was provided via an above-ground hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet lance was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer's exercise was also about showing what can be achieved with few available personnel.
In an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld Day Task Force.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations process
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany, Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on his Facebook page.
There is still a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will ultimately find a solution.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare system
The Australian government is insisting on the harsh terms attached to the $325 million bailout for Tasmanian health care to ensure the state government can't waste the money.
German Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island nation, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for elective services.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract treatments, are intended to remove residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with ideas that affected clinicians have told me are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian government.
The state would have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if "it is not accompanied by real reforms that put Tasmanian's public health system on a more sustainable path."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I'm confident that the federal aid will go a long way toward taking the state's public health system off the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely offset recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today's announcement is only a "band-aid solution".
"We're in today's situation because the Labor state government has pulled $430 million out of the health care system," he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million dollars into the Commonwealth and then pretends that it is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
In protest against the planned tax on the rich, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends inconclusively.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered themselves into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President François Hollande received club and association representatives at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on incomes of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 will therefore be cancelled.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Idioms from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairwoman of the parish council, gave a lecture on the biblical proverbs after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She quoted proverbs such as: Wooden eye be watchful, how scales fall from the eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times, the speaker also let her listeners guess which proverb it was.
The parish councillor Christel Dehner took on the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things come in threes, make blue, spoil something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past."
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes lay covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial about them.
The relationship on the outside is astounding: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is distributed by Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security mania and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "blade runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956 and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, i.e. what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is frighteningly similar to ours, mutants look into the future - and the police intervene.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We grab them even before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no felons in our society, but we have a prison camp full of pesudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things will happen and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's narrative seems like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's eavesdropping spree.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system goes crazy.
It's perfect, but it lies.
It invents its own premises.
Not only accepts errors and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Court Blocks NYPD Stop and Frisk Policy Decision
A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program, absolving the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until an appeal by the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed its assessment and the corrective actions ordered, including the decision to establish a monitoring body to assist the police in changing their policy and training program.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge should be relieved of the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latino men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to oversee the implementation of significant changes, including policy, training and service oversight reforms, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after being checked by the police.
A hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Checks of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded checks during the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latino men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, which developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police headquarters use the scheme.
Opponents argue that the changes will dampen police morale, but not crime; it would also waste money and fail to solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented controls.
Anger over verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily at the verdict for the last of the instigators, who was put on trial, believing that Umar Patek should be summarily shot.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing.
With a suspended sentence, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's popular tourist district, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many more.
A guilty verdict was also found on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even though they could have requested the death penalty for the man, who is also known as the "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly a decade ago.
Fighting back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
Leaving him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports provided evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding ties between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is being commemorated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
Testimony over Merkel spying affair in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spying affair around German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-Year-old personally in Russia, reported the Agency Interfax.
Earlier, Green MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
Leg almost chopped off: New edition of Rocker trial
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security precautions.
The defendants remained silent at the beginning.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the Bandidos at the time.
The public prosecutor's office accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices.
All victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
This was apparently preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about turf wars and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted at the beginning of 2012 in a first trial.
A court spokesman said at the time that it had not been proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the verdict after an appeal by the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the Regional Court for a new hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open prison for another offense.
At the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night of the crime.
The then investigating commissioner was summoned as a witness.
The focus was on mobile phone conversations of the defendants and other people who had been tapped by the police.
What is difficult is that rockers almost always abide by a law that is iron for them in court - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more trial days are scheduled for the trial.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and appears for the first time with a new bob.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has parted ways with her long blonde curls in favor of a platinum blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look on Wednesday in Los Angeles and also posted a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the modest change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?
Let us know what you think in the comments below.
The number of people without a job fell slightly by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy branch manager of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
This is because many companies have so far reacted cautiously when it comes to recruitment.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the trades, in health care and in geriatric care".
Due to the seasons, job vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been coming in again since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The complete background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Traffic light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light signal is defective.
What should you do then - drive on red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "reasonable", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light can be assumed.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite the red light must be aware that he is fully to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who are patient for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the case under negotiation, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped a little later to green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Bombardier Earnings Decline Following Decline in Deliveries and Orders
Canadian aircraft and rail maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from declining third-quarter aircraft orders and deliveries, as well as contract issues in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial service next September according to the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago has only been followed by three more take-offs so far, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday, citing that the stock has limited price potential over the next quarter to two.
"Although weaker aircraft delivery figures were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries' aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, firm orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177 as potential buyers wait for flight test results and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are accurate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test plane has not been grounded longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, which we did.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the rest shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer will be able to put a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier said it was reviewing the Commissioning Plan (EIS) and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of flight tests – even though they appear to be in line with Bombardier's internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, the year before.
Adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The aerospace backlog was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace space, results were in line with our guidance, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division rose by almost eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transportation division was $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly higher than December 31.
Profit margins in the transport business were impacted by settlement problems on some large contracts.
According to the company's management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares fell 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 1 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Regulations on electronic devices on aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their regulations so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "airplane mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision, which U.S. airlines will have to do a lot of work to implement, but have no immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on aircraft," it said.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying it is open to change, but that it must initiate it by lawmakers.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience now that we offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would stick to the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no plans to change that at this time," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly take a close look at the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and modify manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and customer instruction.
"After an airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
A persistent ankle injury threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from playing in FSV Mainz 05's Bundesliga away game at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is fighting for a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his top scorer with six goals.
Mainz already have to do without injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the existing clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
Mayor Hermann Arndt will officially open the exhibition on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle with handsome prizes and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Seriously injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are various witness statements that should first be evaluated.
What is certain is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman trapped so badly that it took the fire brigade just under half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident initially remained unclear.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully closed for about two hours.
British police deliver extradition warrant to Assange
British police today handed over an extradition warrant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a "request to turn himself in" asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of a sexual offence after his options under UK law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "sent a 40-year-old man a request to turn himself in at a police station at a time chosen by us," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States on possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two church services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 7 p.m. during the evening mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the holy sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The mass is performed as part of the church services, as the patron Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind section of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Scientists were able to shed more light on how a dog's tail wagging relates to its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), whereas in nervous dogs it was the left side.
Yet now scientists say other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain react differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right hemisphere is responsible for moving the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail wagging of their conspecifics, the researchers monitored the animals while they watched films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably soon we will understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilt was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog wagging), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience which movements they should and should not worry about.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and wagging your tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behaviour and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behaviour, then you react on the basis of those experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand their pet's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in canine behaviour and a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog.
Another piece of research at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: "Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' wags left rather than right, rather than getting restless – exactly the opposite of the Italian study."
According to him, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined – and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic issues.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, limiting his comments mostly to foreign policy and his role as an envoy to the Middle East Quartet of Peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard in London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely to happen, so..."
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers recover charred body
The fire brigade had to move out late Thursday evening in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
The rescue workers recover a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident was still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday evening, there had been a fire on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned down completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
For the time being, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear.
Constance: Cyclist kills 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a ladies' bicycle on the left sidewalk from the station square in the direction of the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a restaurant onto the sidewalk, the cyclist could not brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and suffered a laceration about 15 centimeters long on the head.
An ambulance team brought the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.

UN announces new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by Member States to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also intervened in the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education in the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music belong together in Stuttgart as a jazz location.
Özdemir, who is considered the favorite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on September 22, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is pushing for a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, among other things, the jazz and pop course is to be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
Pawn shops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has reached the middle class
At a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand is so great in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its swap, became the third pawn shop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pawning jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawn shops in Singapore charge an APR of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent charged by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn shops offer the advantage that no creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawn shops as families feel the pressure of rising living costs as well as rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to make up for the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's cited growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product, according to the agency.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about high consumer debt in Thailand, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued export weakness and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle to low end (of the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend of pawning personal belongings as people seize the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city-state's 200 pawn shops are gold.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four properties – but also outside Asia, according to yes Lee Ching, managing director of ValueMax.
The company is funding that with 60 percent of the $66 million Singapore it raised this week with its IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, yes explains that pawn shops not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers lend items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables doesn't increase household schooling," she explains.
The pawnbroking business is increasingly accepted by society as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnbroking are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
"This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says yes.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick scolding for Shiris: Mane not a swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current top form of Bundesliga leaders Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are pushed into the category of swallow kings," he defended the two offensive whirlers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3-0 win against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was doomed by an alleged acting - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself claims to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the run of success, Rangnick sang a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for this: Really good," he said.
There's not much to complain about.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
This should go on quietly.
There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to make a difference.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England from the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was delighted to be working with the UK Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed line between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in discussions with Transport Scotland, has engaged HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for the north of England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network that brings the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it's also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic power makes the case for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are delighted to be working as a partner with the UK Government and exploring the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will benefit all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with UK ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Living with future prospects
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastic.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of no longer being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties has had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, she published a book on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment surrounded by greenery.
Today, in her mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of 'living in old age' at all.
Most people suppress it as long as possible.
Only the others get old,' she says with a grin.
Only when the suffering is really great, one thinks.
"But then it may already be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'But which form of housing you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for old age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can also unite in Dolce Vita,' the textbook author points out those willing to relocate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner flat.
In old age, everyone has their tics and quirks
'For me, however, such a shared apartment would be nothing,' she says with a twinkle in her eye.
Especially not like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In old age, you simply need your retreats," says Ries.
Nevertheless, the author does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior living community can still work.
However, this would have to be different than in the classic student flat.
And sometimes you just want your peace," she believes.
She is not alone in this opinion, at least in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as possible' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the Citizens' Service Life in Old Age in the state capital.
Her service advises people on the subject of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions, just to be able to stay in their familiar environment, this is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment to first inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rented apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, clarifies the interior designer.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment in an age-appropriate and thus barrier-free way, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path to the apartment door, which is also paved with stairs, would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
She dreads the move more than the spider at her apartment door.
NSA siphons data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service whistleblower Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany solve the increasingly explosive NSA spying affair.
According to Green MP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-secret service employee would testify before a German public prosecutor's office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Motorist seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-Year-old from Müsch was against 21.15 clock with her car on the Kempen outer ring in the direction of Grefrath on the way.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The driving eyes collided.
The Aachen resident suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The TSV Morsum is after six matchdays still without any point in the Handball-Verbandsliga.
Now, of all times, Ingo Ehlers' team will play tomorrow's derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope that we finally have a clear head," says Ehlers cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Like us, Daverden also relies on tempo.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has recently left anything but a secure impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's not why we're the favourites, because anything can happen in the derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to up the ante in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
But the A-youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-youth Bundesliga club HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Cocaine addicted lawyer who warned drug lord of police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld great Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool's Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyer who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction might be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld figure Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
Hailed by criminalists as "top-notch," the lawyer, nicknamed "Bash," was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officials watched as Scarborough, 32, delivered three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were being monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Along with 32 others, they were later arrested after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted of two counts of obstruction of justice at Liverpool's Crown Court after a three-week trial.
He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier interrogation.
The lawyer was convicted after police investigated Scarborough to find that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming their discussion was subject to "attorney-client privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During police interrogation, he stated that he ran an office both at his home address and at work, and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law."
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defence lawyer because he got too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta made the step from a defence lawyer to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who asked him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to entrench himself behind the façade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also resulted in three convictions for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty of conspiracy to traffick heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a Q&A section about himself, stating that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate dinner guest was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Until now, the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were called only twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues immediately, no property damage should have occurred.
Furthermore, some New Year's Eve firecrackers were probably ignited in the city area, but here too no property damage has occurred.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found all his wheel covers in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to take any further action.
A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation celebration to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubhouse of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness under the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festivity to make honors.
This time, secretary Rolf Wagener was happy about the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but have also made many rounds for us, for which we would like to thank us very much," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to the choirmaster Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place went to music supervisor Artur Brückner.
The board addressed a special thank you to the team of club landlady Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the clubhouse.
"New singing voices are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
Council targets railway tracks
Should the level crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to spend 220,000 euros on this.
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzig Valley railway line next year.
In particular, safety at level crossings is to be increased - collisions of trains with other vehicles regularly occur nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute one third of the costs, the rest is shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city architect Roland Grießhaber explained the special features of the "Am Hirschen" crossing to the local council.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Even larger vehicles, such as those transporting long timber, could stand there in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the adjacent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the necessity of a road spread: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to spend so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The level crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long timber transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the up to 20-meter-long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the level crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be of important traffic importance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of widening the road.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the level crossing was approved by a majority with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall would be built in such a way that the city could expand the adjoining road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 metres for encounter traffic, if necessary.
The reconstruction of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could result in a completely different problem affecting access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the reconstruction plans of the railway examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then still be possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting up.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as the road construction authority.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the turning worked in the current state of development, one should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing, argued Haas.
In addition, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is significantly lower at this point than at the other level crossings, because there is a good line of sight directly next to it, with which there is a good line of sight.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision threatens.
The majority refused to approve the conversion of this level crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "pay for" the problem with ride-on vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the modifications at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway, to be unproblematic.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom Management Board said.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is stored, is creating an increased risk on conventional routes, according to officials.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries on the planned route will begin by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this will no longer be made at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements is thus omitted - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by posting announcements that affect individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai, among others, are already dispensing with the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls sound through the loudspeakers in one day - it should be quieter at the airport in the future.
"Experience has also shown that these individual announcements were relatively little noticed, but at the same time all other information about changed gates or departure times is a bit lost here," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, vaudeville artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they eventually became too well-known to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival has grown, so has the world of comedy.
A number of the comedians attending this year's festival have become known through more unconventional channels, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically raunchy fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racial-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets at the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has grown into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous hands-on activities and events.
"Young and old can learn various old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
Regional craftsmen are available to help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
In the museum workshop, there is also work.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or spinning tops, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilt walking, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all little detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 noon and 2 pm.
On a tour of the terrain, the children have to guess which stories are true or lies.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who plays his joke with the museum guests from 11 o'clock.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner is cosy and fairytale-like.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 am.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom maker, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders at their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Guido Wolf, President of the Landtag, was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow will come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important question together with the managing principals of the vocational schools and the district grammar school and the chairmen of the parents' council.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasized Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the support centre, the district grammar school and the vocational school centre in the Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also on the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were taking care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of employment," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"After all, those who have already become acquainted with the advantages of the region during their studies often remain with the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to strengthening the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places are offered, the demand for skilled workers can be covered.
In his opinion, the locational advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand local public transport.
"Continue to be persistent and make public transport better," he said to the local politicians present.
Australian appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making false testimony after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
Later, however, video camera footage showed that she had arrived safely at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Ruby League player who approached the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are obviously very worried, but we hope she will be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free on bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian reports reported that she is now vacationing in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be trying to improve its tarnished tourist image after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, and may therefore be acquitted.
Painting the construction fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has embellished the construction fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the terrain threatens to slide.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had discussed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the BI action, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been installed.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against building ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the realization of the city's project, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign themselves because the city continues to delay these answers, according to BI.
As was heard, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he fears the end of the thermal bath, should the population vote in the referendum against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem downright frightened because of this, others perceive it as a "clumsy blackmail attempt" against the population, according to the BI press release.
BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, while heavy clashes broke out in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the deadline on
November 1, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set to destroy or make "inoperable" all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling munitions.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the death toll in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is "now convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing/filling facilities identified by Syria and witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit to two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned... and the chemical weapons program objects there had been transferred to other facilities mentioned, which were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I take my hat off to the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," Ahmed Uzumcu, the monitoring organization's director-general, said in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a powerful explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, including two people familiar with the situation; this is a further indication that the global official investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed they are cooperating with authorities in investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 quadrillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation sparked by the Libor interbank business scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this issue continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a previous trader to the UK's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and has reportedly been put on leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was put on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's instant message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority COMCO, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers colluded in transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails dating back several years in search of cases of wrongdoing.
News of this research has thrown traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks' trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year as low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is nearly impossible to manipulate the expansive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in Forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks means that "you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly six million dollars late last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had an affair with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and tracked her, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court learned.
"According to prosecutors, Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people's homes hoping to catch them red-handed, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors of Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editors when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was seized from Mulcare's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
While the research was ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw monitoring Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail saying, "I have a story that we want to get out tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about."
Edis said Coulson's activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone hacking.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair as early as the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics' annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that's not a sign that puberty is coming quickly," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, show up earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (occurrence of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it still takes at least two to three years until menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually constitutes the onset of puberty, but it is considered "precocious" if breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates — something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
With faster progression, tests by an endocrinologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and ward off another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits, "Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They're worried about pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys, like girls, enter puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes the most compelling premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study of girls aged six to nine that established a link between body fat and the onset of puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that play a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than expected.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In glorious weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to master the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous amateur cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Championships.
As expected, these two were able to pull away from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was able to place second again.
In the women's race, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Albtraum who made it to the top of the podium.
Second and third place went to Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race, there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to pull away from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Together with a teammate, Pangerl has already twice been world champion in twelve-hour driving.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon, will also be there.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a blink of an eye finale at the finish in front of the Drei-Seen-Halle.
Pangerl raced across the finish line first.
Only one second behind, the veteran Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann crossed the finish line in third place overall.
In the women's classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Second place went to Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB supporters had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena with flares.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that was offered to the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runners-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Mostly the guest fans could be heard with their songs.
The South Stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, was initially exceptionally quiet: no chants, no battle cries.
The podium of the capo, who otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban" flew lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was the first BVB player to enter the pitch, as always, did momentary jubilation erupt.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Stand nothing moved.
Even the fact that stadium announcer Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebratory mood.
Only five minutes before kick-off, the capo climbed his podium - and the tension, which had been almost palpable until then, erupted in a loud shout, as Dickel queried the mood in the stands in the stadium as usual.
Finally, as always, it was the turn of the South Stand - and finally it was the loudest place in the stadium as usual.
And at the latest when the loud request "Derby winner stands up" came from the south stand with kick-off, everything was as usual again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters who had travelled with them had fired flares into the spectator stands and onto the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreographing for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbade that," he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
"This will be drastic," assured Watzke.
It will be interesting to see how the reactions on the south stand turn out.
What happens to my email on the go?
E-mail actually means electronic letter.
Was the secrecy of correspondence technically implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail, similar to conventional mail?
In the conception of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, in the basic technical protocols, no care has been taken to create a stable foundation for a hearing-proof correspondence.
Therefore, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the track, the mail can run through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the network?
Most e-mails are read several times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
With systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability that unauthorized persons will read an e-mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying operations.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against eavesdropping?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against eavesdropping.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to obfuscate the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo-Mail's shares had fallen recently, Google's GMail was able to gain significantly.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the regional church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could make a good living from it.
Certainly, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a secure employer.
This accommodates today's young people, who are not only interested in careers, but in meaningful work.
According to the regional church, which covers three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology studies begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to fill positions in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President with it.
Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual offences involving children before allegations were made in 2011 against child care worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
But in the opening statement to the commission, the YMCA had stated that it had "never had anything to do with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization."
Executive Director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a physical education teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that "there had been external reviews of the YMCA recognising the YMCA as at the forefront of child safety".
Rather, evidence before the commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest score out of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Hare, who joined YMCA at 21, admitted management failed to hire Lord "from me down" and failed to ensure employees were aware of their obligations to report child safety policy violations.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexually assaulting twelve boys during his two years with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented staff from reporting Lord's child safety violations.
Staff said they observed violations, including being alone with children, babysitting them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling one that he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's supervisor at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and very aloof most of the time".
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare stated that he had communicated to the YMCA NSW board of directors his view that the lesson the organisation had to learn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" "did not concern reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to pressure employees to sign confidentiality commitments shortly after the allegations occurred was made by YMCA's Children's Services executive director, Liam Whitley.
He said this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, verifying, inducting, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At a length of about 120 meters below Cologne, a sewer from Roman times has been preserved.
If you visit Cologne, you can't miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise about 157 meters into the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too big remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the parking garage therefore rush past the Roman remains today and only park their cars.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in parking deck D2.
You can see ruins about five meters high made of palm-sized stones.
"They are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look into a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft on the upper parking level.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, where the participants descend back into the depths.
Here we experience the official residence of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the praetor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in a good German as much as "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the vestibule of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here over a length of about 120 meters.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers up the guests.
Schulze still has one surprise.
After fetching the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to access the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.
To this day, different water levels can be read in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, due to changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah will become part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is scheduled to begin shortly.
However, it will still be a few years before completion.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support, to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable path to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the rigours and realities of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it's going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge includes a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport control in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde bill pointed to the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not feature in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what they really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that is already so old that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" duck was at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the European tune?
Why swap the London yoke for Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project has officially died.
Across the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded just this year, won nearly five million votes in September's federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of Britain's Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is proving to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket into which the respective national economies are forced by sticking to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned its members to exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen at Grangemouth.
All the world's wage fixing does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and raising Paris to par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, which the ailing French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive by-election, relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for Britain's Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right will automatically benefit the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among white French people of the working class?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to forge an anti-EU, anti-single currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of ingratiating itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put where.
I suspect Scotland could do quite well in a looser European alliance if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider following Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 for rejecting proposed (and made) cuts led by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to be forced into austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Passengers Can Now Use Electronic Devices on Airplanes (but Not Make Cell Phone Calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from take-off to landing, but can't make phone calls, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented would depend on the airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage policies to comply with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of wearable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we may approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to take them off again until the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers must switch it off again and may not take it off again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during takeoff, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit," commented Glading.
We are honestly tired of feeling like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are encouraged to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
Regulatory authority for phone calls rests with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA May Lift Ban on Certain Electronic Devices on Takeoff and Landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert on national transportation issues, told CBS News that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission towers," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment by passenger-carrying FM radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they don't mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi when altitude is reached for several years.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit minimal radiation when you turn the page.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing restrictions on passengers' device use is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but couldn't find any.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk associated with the use of equipment.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he believed the interference from the devices was genuine, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports from pilots suggesting that aircraft systems were disrupted by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to shut down the devices when landing instruments in poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them a reasonable fit for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham are the pork legs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how the company "Adler" in Bonndorf works.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted for refreshment at fast food in Waldshut
"A huge amount of work is done here," marvel the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with class?
Details such as the pH value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm curious when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
Here, the level of private television is presented in its purest form.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the clubs is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
The smoke tower and smoke firing remind Jumbo visually of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears into the jumbo," he announces the test consumption.
"It's really delicious," concludes the TV star.
Everyone involved will be able to live with that.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions take hosts by surprise
With a small squad, the men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school gym in Reutlingen.
The Älbler stood with an experienced team on the other side of the net.
Soon, however, it became apparent that, also due to age, they could not quite keep up with the quick actions of the Freudenstadters.
With the hard and placed serves, the Gönninger had a hard time.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks passed cleanly over the middle of the net by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not on the spot in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadt team in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat laxly and listlessly to the 3:0 final score (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, TV Baiersbronn, who clearly prevailed in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and scoring gifts, especially when receiving the ball; even with the passes, precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes the overzealousness prevented the view for possible point gains.
In this very balanced encounter in terms of performance, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team was consistently committed to the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the community hall to have the planned measures explained, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
According to Häußler, the flood that caught Gechingen unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future.
A river basin study had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The planning is based on protection against a flood that is statistically expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had led to considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can count on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the funding would only be available if an overall concept was implemented.
For this purpose, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported), provides for local measures in the tributary of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to voice their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, one is obliged to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald of Wald and Corbe.
There was resentment among residents of the old town, who even in normal thunderstorms have to suffer again and again from an overload of the sewer network.
The administration is aware of the problem and the first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the sewer network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events can be absorbed.
Making the sewers larger would cost millions.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new café.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the lexicon, déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name on Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to be pure déjà vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally but tangible and recurring.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A look into the inner workings at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team headed by the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner spoils the guest with a wide variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
Accompanied by delicious cakes or individually topped fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café on Opschlag: In Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least through the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two would like to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The likeable owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations yourself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt a cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells NRZ.
There have already been two events in the bright café.
Or rather, one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," said the two 33-year-olds.
But not for everyone.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings: "You can't please everyone".
And with an event, I only ever address those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb normal operations as little as possible."
In other words: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The street, which is developing more and more into a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in economy class – not always the ones airlines strive to achieve, but this designated space is key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that mandates a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in tourist class, but U.S. arch-rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft makers are vying to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft and are expecting record orders at the Nov. 17-21 event.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is decisive for the stated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" holds 406 people in tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch-wide seats in economy class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often hand out blows over technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to win the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing backers a picture of three people squeezed together in a restaurant and titled, "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
With changing eating habits, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats haven't changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, research has been carried out that shows that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat dimensions, saying it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines strike a balance between fares and facilities.
The company also states that according to research, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width.
"It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful," said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it's about more elbow room, but for manufacturers, it's increasingly becoming an issue that can impact sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is the driving force behind the controversy over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X, with its ten seats per row, to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggest that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could come with cheaper airfares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is, from an economic standpoint, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, cabin furnishing expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The globetrotting jet sellers even carry tape measure with them to measure the furnishings of the competition.
Even if they advertise comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density designs for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability, offering wide aisle seats for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle out, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
According to the lexicons, veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan refrains from all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
One may wonder what remains, but on closer inspection, the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local health food store, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor says of the vegans' maxim, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a renunciation, not an asceticism, but it is an enrichment." Proctor attributes the assumption that a change in diet reduces the choice of food options to the power of habit.
And it was precisely this conditioning that caused even the most well-intentioned attempts to fail.
"The addictive factor is a very decisive factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And objects: "Certain tastes are not to be pinned on the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but that's not just about animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are excellent, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many veganism critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 levels are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go long distances for food procurement.
After all, staples are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find locally.
Only now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is also known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, Proctor was able to amaze his parents-in-law with his vegan cheesecakes.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamism, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been met with skepticism.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with tact.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to live an enclave existence.
And on closer inspection, the everyday world does not seem as foreign to vegans as assumed - and the vegan does not seem as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
French fries are everywhere!
"Many kebab shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he switches to pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly adapting to this.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can identify a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they might be inclined to add to the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will have at least one vegan dish on their menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the vast majority impossible in the first place," says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if you learn to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as colorants, you seem to quickly lose courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and cleaning agents.
"Little by little, you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos to look out for. "Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral hint that strikes the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't quite manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
Bayern's basketball players optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe that we can win against the best team in Europe of the past two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In only their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The visitors first managed the feat of converting a 15-point deficit into a lead with 13 minutes to go, before Piraeus turned the game around again.
"We fought back unbelievably against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made careless mistakes again," said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put an end to smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More trials are needed before testing in humans, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but have found their nicotine addiction stronger than these approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information to make nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from experiencing a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "time out," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if completely safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
"They know that when they start smoking again, they don't feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them break the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but warned at the same time that more research was needed.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier fare than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the story tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to convent by her family.

The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penitential shirt for the audience.
Egypt swears in first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi is taking the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to spell the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who had been ousted from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been targeted by the government, mostly as a banned organization, since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after eleven a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer on the new president, and unlike Mubarak-era presidential pageantry, traffic was halted only briefly to allow the convoy of cars to cross the usually busy street connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Derided as an uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as the candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to advance the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to in a watchful position.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest lecture hall with chants of "The army and the people are one hand".
Built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the ousted leader.
But by taking the official oath in court and not, as usual, in parliament, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the men's choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, during which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's choir.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which has now become more than beloved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral consultant on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association as well as an engraved pewter plate.
In addition to the tribute, the 31st Autumn Festival proceeded in the usual ways: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They serenaded their honorary singer Hubert Wermter with a little serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's choir Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchgehst durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir took us to foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk tune "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to their home country with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical finale.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a puppet theater and read a few stories, which kept the children busy at lunchtime.
Frontier Airlines charges for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to stow carry-on luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though Wednesday's announcement said passengers would be allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to carry-on baggage in the overhead compartment, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it charges $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who pay at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at getting travelers to take care of payment upfront.
"We don't want to calculate that sum," she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second pieces of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the overhead bins above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry one piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier gate, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so passengers were aware of the fee before they arrived at the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on baggage fee won't come into effect until the summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
So far, however, most have kept their hands off charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago, followed later by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit raised $50 million annually in carry-on baggage charges.
Sorensen, who previously held a senior position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what to expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual carry-on baggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and violent discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and boarding was running smoothly."
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 charged for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought soda or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's move to charge carry-on baggage when passengers don't buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began awarding only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were shortened again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A third-party Frontier flight over 1000 miles earns customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get a grip on Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald-Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep", the day was concluded in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Then we went via the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-meter-high observation deck of the Empire State Building while enjoying the view.
Then we went through the hectic hustle and bustle of New York's streets via Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to linger briefly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic fundamentals are right and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets are benefiting from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to other European countries.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out at the 9th Real Estate Day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
According to Ulbrich, a look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial real estate is.
In the first three quarters of this year, it grew by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In Great Britain the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and German government bonds is at a historically high level.
Parents of Georgia Teenager Who Died in Tragic Accident Believe Murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosa, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he had died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it lacks all logic, violates the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional suffocation."
A second autopsy, however, revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the county sheriff's office was not immediately willing to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities must release any surveillance videos that investigators reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video recordings included clues as to how he died.

John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that US espionage has "gone unreasonably far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the US defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that the espionage had "gone unreasonably far" in certain cases.
The secretary of state also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for putting the company on "autopilot" when whistleblower Edward Snowden's explosive revelations about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leaked information has plunged the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
In a televised speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said, "There is no question that the president and I, and others in government, learned about some things that happened on autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do so, which dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, September 11."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone unreasonably far."
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament officials and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations due to frustration with National Security Agency surveillance.
"It is very important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans stay on board in our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who is a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the intelligence chief said this week the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had been monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common practice on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his agency was preparing the congressional trip scheduled to take place this year, hoping the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MEPs are to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also spoke of there being some "serious words."
He said European governments need to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with resentment over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centres in the Zollernalbkreis are receiving mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote would like to support the institutions in realising their building and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and crèches from the entire Zollernalbkreis can take part in the campaign.
If you have a building or beautification request for your interior, you can apply with this to the Schwarzwälder Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten Construction Site campaign.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many diligent construction helpers.
What is the action day and the helpers all about?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over his parental leave plans because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal battle over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to brush aside questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to eliminate or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He's in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it would be faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, dial immediately and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Voting with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new position "very seriously."
A public office is about serving the public.
"We seek no reward other than that of history, which is that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the running.
Distant worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets near other stars.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that those responsible at the European Space Agency (ESA) are currently asking.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees review the proposals and follow up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific program committee.
ESA has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme, which was initiated in 2007, are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be examined in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately shed light on the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter", ESA has already approved an M-class mission (where the budget is around half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely observe the Sun's surface and activity.
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
To this end, ESA is planning the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and will study the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there will also be deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, which makes up stars, planets and creatures like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, whose action accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", ESA has already approved an M mission, which is scheduled for launch in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could win the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-LISA", an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being approved as an L-mission.
By this, physicists mean changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
In contrast to facilities on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves generated during the Big Bang and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which will study black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will detect and study Earth-like planets.
Among other things, proposals for sample return from Mars, for the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics have already been rejected.
CDC Releases School Allergy Guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with children's food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among faculty and staff and how to deal with children who exhibit allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools stock epinephrine – EpiPen-branded auto-injection is the most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators recently changed regulations to make it easier for schools to stock epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms cited by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like there's a hair on it," or "My tongue tingles."
Fire brigade called to rescue a pooch that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered in her predicament by a walker in the quarry.
Firefighters abseiled down the rock face and saved the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to bring a pooch to safety, which was stuck on a 15-meter-high ledge in a rock face.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who own the dog, came to Flappit Quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby and thank firefighters from the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and published calls for help on social networks when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker walking his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and abseiled to the rescue of Ruby, who was then transported upstairs in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from above and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue – she was frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog biscuits.
This was quite an unusual mission.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in my arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid it would fall down, but it stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
US border: "Super tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities announced, the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, train tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig their way under the radar," Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference outside a San Diego warehouse where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured, "If you keep building tunnels like this and trying to use them, we're determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a constant battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico related to drug-related crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electrically powered wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres high and 90 centimetres wide.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was caught for the confiscated marijuana.
All three face the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it was said at the press conference in San Diego.
However, it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the US.
No details were given to those arrested, at least one was Mexican, it said.
They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama's retreat on health care policy
After heavy criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of termination from their insurer, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama qualified his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep it," he said during a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the layoffs, Obama urged those Americans who had received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come up with a better deal," he said.
The government said it was unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for another tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans very directly: They deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of an angry Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri. The issue was whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced state-sponsored insurance in order to conclude a tariff with HealthCare.gov herself, which she now wanted to sell to millions of Americans.
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender undetermined"
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can state "indefinite" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding sex assignment operations for newborns and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born each year, neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that one should use the best available gender assignment information if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding on surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don't," he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait and see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity in the first place is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the mystery of why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender people because their status is not gender-related, but determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics manifested themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender image now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third gender" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, became the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifelong retention of "undetermined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the staunchly Catholic country signed a petition calling for the "gender theory" to be removed from textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, arguing: "When the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not, then we twist two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she thinks it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Being a parent is stressful enough even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine saw gender as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now that the ethical basis of surgery is being questioned, now that it is known how complex gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign.
"In the mid-20th century, this was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considers themselves male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual surgeries came forward who are "not happy with the outcome."
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to receive a vaginal plasty.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
As a result of the operation, he has become infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of California-based law group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law could "encourage labeling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an 'not fixed,'" she explained.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't yet know how the law will play out, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised as third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law deals with assignment at birth.
This is not a fight that young children should be forced to do at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg breast radiologist who has a daughter with sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says German law "empowers" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff member in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to take different tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of parents.
And you don't have to rush to perform an operation that can't be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and removes the fear that concerns parents because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that's wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea", is tailor-made for Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hand in his profession, acting.
Nobody can fool the old man Santiago when fishing.
So the two complement each other just great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles on the back of the old man's neck that the fisherman Manolo talks about.
When Santiago sits on the chair, bent over from life, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is a character role through and through, which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is in long stretches as a solo actor on stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he sheds light on the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings about Cuba's attitude to life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glow-in-the-dark ice – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals to create a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in your mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says: "The product is incredible, but still at a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We've been testing it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has that wonderful glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is set to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to make an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible in and of itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we'll find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the Neues Museum of the castle will deal with the topic "To hell with hell - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, Salem Castle and the Lake Constance District Cultural Office.
In the forum, Johanna Rahner wants to explore the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in past centuries and relied on those images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas today", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for completion is characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out of Christians by the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She had "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the nuisance of death".
Connected to this is the question of that longing "that dreams that everything may be good in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997, also in Freiburg.
His habilitation in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: Fair provides answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding celebration succeeds, gave now a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers around a wedding were represented.
A trend: The retro look has found its way back.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is a must, preferably covered or in cream.
At the front, the often ruffled and embroidered dresses are closed, often with a veil, at the back, however, they go down the back and often end up in a train.
However, opinions differ on this, as Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes.
For men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The selection of the restaurant was important, it was explained.
Unadorned adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the coach house.
If you want to drive up by carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Carriages are also popular for hen parties," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. series of shots in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable celebration.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, launched an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against handset makers on Thursday, including Google, the company it outbid in Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be reached immediately.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and most recently offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being outbid on Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in suit at auction, Google infringed the patents and continues to do so," the complaint said.
Rockstar is seeking substantial damages from Google for claiming Google's patent infringement was intentional, according to the accusation.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become considerably more expensive.
The magistrate of the city is discussing this morning on a submission by traffic department head Stefan Majer (Greens).
Accordingly, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices are not to be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines is to be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council has to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility directly in front of the shop is "an advantage for smaller specialist dealers that should not be underestimated".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also become more expensive.
Oil price continues to fall to USD 96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector was growing.
The reference crude oil grade for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe late this morning.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, marking a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This points to a continued recovery of China's economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after hitting its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point we go home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Sure, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a snack?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to getting fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become noticeable.
Because what do you have to miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?", I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the nearest trash can?
It's not just that the paper stuff spoils the landscape.
Bags have also covered traffic facilities such as crash barriers, causing accidents.
But said "throwaway society" does not think about such a thing, probably it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are often on the road in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after nights of partying: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
A few bags more or less wouldn't matter - in contrast to the street, where nobody wants to trample on the leftovers of others.
I can already see the day coming when the cities and municipalities become too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with vegetable cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation mentions others on World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Whippable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
For example, doughs are loosened instead of eggs with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silken tofu can serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, believing they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring field of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups, arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record miles driven — and possibly where they were driven — and then use the information to calculate tax assessments.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are not waiting any longer.
They are currently looking at how they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's not something we're just potentially going to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record miles driven by all California motorists in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is bankrupt.
But in America, people don't fill up as much as they used to.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state fuel tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per liter) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by even one cent when fuel prices are high.
"The gasoline tax just isn't sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transportation legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mileage-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban liberals, as the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust fumes are reduced.
California's planners rely on the system to develop strategies to meet the state's ambitious, statutory climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also said he sees this as the most viable long-term alternative.
The independent marketers of the Reason Foundation are also attracted to the idea of making drivers pay according to the distance traveled.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. secretaries of transportation who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives blocked the push, responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing people who often have to travel long miles to work or the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nonetheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most engaged is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the nation's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently exploring how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical at the thought that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, director of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
As the test began, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website, "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-blown monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on individuals' daily movements.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to track miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
This, according to Khan, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some agencies to a small startup called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally run to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are supposed to pay based on miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations aren't recorded," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that can also be used to pay parking fees, insurance only for kilometers driven, and to collect real-time speed data from other vehicles that will help drivers avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," according to a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if all the talk about paying per mile isn't just a huge red herring.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for surgery if one aspirin is enough," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and many other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose any of its importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had probably wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for some reason were left behind.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as for many speakers.
FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, was therefore also wet.
He thanked Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and members of the association who got involved.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also acknowledged by Karl Rombach, Member of the Landtag.
Further greetings were given for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn affected the original grass pitch to such an extent that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third square at the grounds of the football club or at the secondary school at the Salinensee was considered.
Both were discarded.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of an artificial turf sports pitch, which was widely regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in hereditary lease, promised a cost share of 100,000 euros for the construction of the field and the state approved subsidies of 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros of the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
Construction of the 68 x 108 metre artificial turf pitch began on 4 June.
During the construction phase, which lasted more than three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used to create a dirt bike track.
Unknown injure girl by shooting from car
Unknown have injured in shots from a car a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had fired on Thursday evening in Genthin, probably with an air gun on a group of children.
This was announced by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured in the left calf.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A window broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police are investigating, it was said on Friday.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US secret service, has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he wrote: "Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with the threat of punishment in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said the opportunity should be seized to hear Snowden as a witness if possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied on his visit to Russia by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the MP.
Snowden explains in his letter that he faces a "serious and ongoing" campaign of persecution that has driven him from his home.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a credit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Security concerns grow in Mozambique amid clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to chant calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the country's future, she swapped her business attire for a T-shirt that read "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, some of the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of vast offshore gas deposits and coal deposits in the northwest could attract over $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a "loser" who wants to "use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and do it seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) banging their heads together," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said.
Renamo's capacity is unclear, but it has launched disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south route.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga replied cautiously when asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
The instability has added to frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media outlet, because many people are already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads," he said.
Hansjakob moves once again to Freihof
Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach 100 years ago, and on Sunday his last years came alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene play.
From his arrival to the award of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his childhood heaven, to his Freihof.
And then the scene play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his signature role as the great son of the city.
In true style, he drove up with the pair and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann knew incredibly well how to put herself in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitably selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler, who paid his respects on behalf of the then incumbent Hättich together with part of the city council, then paid his respects to the award of honorary citizenship.
The Epiphany singers then paid their respects, prompting Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, childhood memories of my own Epiphany come alive again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Heraus, Aus".
At that time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the Heimaterde, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene.
There was much applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after call
A front-page Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express will undergo a "comprehensive rectification," the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Guangdong Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator said in a statement.
She said they had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter's license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant New Express officials be identified and the New Express leadership team be reviewed without delay."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, reporting alleged financial irregularities at a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two front-page appeals for his release and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the public's trust," he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was after money and fame.
I realized that I did the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely coerced, despite a change in the law earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizen policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline is Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Haigerloch: Church of the Last Supper comes into focus
As the city's contribution to the 150th anniversary of the existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's Culture and Tourism Office is dedicating this year's last of this year's public themed tours on Sunday, 27 October, to the Last Supper Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule, will be considered.
The crowning glory is a visit to the Church of the Last Supper.
There, the tour participants are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the view in the church also falls on the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the one-and-a-half-hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkellermuseum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Mick Jagger explains that he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry explained that she had dinner with the alt-rocker, and that "he teased me when I was 18".
She added: "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he "categorically denies that he ever made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" immediately landed at number 1 this week.
NSA says an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug crippled its public website for a few hours, not hackers as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight due to an internal error occurring during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be fixed that evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and still is not available for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, is now in the public eye and facing sharp criticism at home and abroad following revelations in recent months about its extensive surveillance program – a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence agency fueled initial speculation that today's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spying affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it was said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden is threatened with extradition there, it said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life", says one author.
The stories of Thor show that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths were "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that myth and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "overly didactic", children "completely switch off" because in entertaining stories the messages are conveyed "subliminally".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can have certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be presented subliminally, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be bucking the trend.
The company has raised its full-year profit outlook and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted pre-tax annual profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous guidance.
If the current targets are met, it will mean growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved a profit of eight percent in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private businesses.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on track for record annual earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings drivers.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK fared similarly well, while business customers also spent less here.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a profit for the full year is expected for the third year in a row.
Shares of Flight Centre rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Falkenberg discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it's "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Mail hardly empties on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes of the city center and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," says the FDP.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten also Sunday is emptied, will not be answered in the answer to the request of the FDP.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially for appointment mail.
"Despite the price increase for letters on January 2013, this company is radically and unreasonably thinning this out."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the parliamentary group and city association of the Liberals, supports his parliamentary colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are secretly changed or cancelled here."
Swiss Post is miles away from being close to citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," Bittner and Röhrenbeck said in unison.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens must be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that Swiss Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
However, in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said that "life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and himself still love each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Haslach: Skepticism is visibly giving way to confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, fundamental changes will change in the pastoral care unit Haslach (SE).
There will then be only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new is hesitantly but visibly giving way to confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the full-time employees of the pastoral care team ranged from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the revised guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
According to this, the SE Haslach as a parish will in future form a corporation under public law, which will assume the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of trustees, in which the pastor is represented by virtue of his office.
At least two elected members from each parish should be represented, in the six parishes so-called parish teams are formed locally.
In the future, its task will be to promote church life in the village.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish, there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The changes stipulate that accumulated assets in the parishes will be retained for a specific purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire municipality.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then affects all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Barbar Ritter, chairwoman of the committee in the pastoral care unit Schutterwald-Neuried, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
In 2006, they had set themselves the task of "becoming one, staying five" and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral care unit then set about answering questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the parish teams.
The elaborations will be substantiated in further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who imposed a stamp duty of 7% on dwellings costing over £2 million in the 2012 budget, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold dwellings as a company rather than as individuals.
Already, revenue from stamp duty on residential property in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to argue that high-quality real estate is undertaxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated council tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London or discourage owners from selling," he added.
Prime real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London's affluent southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" with the southwestern part of the city, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) experiencing an upward trend, according to research by Savills.
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four matchdays, there is still a good mood at the handball Oberliga club.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what such a victory tastes like anymore," Malmon expects a sense of achievement from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-division reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet uprooted any trees, Malmon raises his index finger in warning.
I trained many players myself in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it remains to be seen whether reinforcements from the first team will be there," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally get back on the road to success, the Malmon team must definitely improve compared to past performances.
Above all, in the cover work and the switching game, it was recently but enormously lacking.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely improve.
So I hope that my players finally cleared their heads during the short break.
US wants to prosecute Snowden
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of having passed on secret information without permission.
Therefore, he had to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said the spokeswoman for the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even Snowden's latest statements would not change that.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German member of the government.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times has obtained a copy of the forthcoming book, and reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to see if he dropped Biden would look better for Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to Jonathan Martin, national policy correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by leading campaign and White House officials, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to gauge the effect on poll numbers of swapping former Secretary Clinton for Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, Obama's former campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
"Double Down" claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole bunch of things to consider, and this was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible poll numbers at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigation as "due diligence," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort was made during the re-election campaign to see if such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
"In campaigns, not as much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," Martin explained on AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential move.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political soundings had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the investigation into whether Biden should be dropped in the election.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Local council pleased with solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be booked as a complete success.
This became clear at the presentation of the annual financial statements for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was more than one million euros higher than planned.
At around 1.8 million euros, the surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros above the estimate.
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax revenues and the municipality's share of income tax.
The asset budget was also well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the allocation of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this out of your sleeve," praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local councillors were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to do without high rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies from the state have often been cut.
There are prerequisites for these subsidies from various equalisation stocks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for subsidies must have certain rates.
"We have to look at the issue of levy rates, as investments are due in the coming years, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their profession of faith at confirmation
In two divine services, 101 15- and 16-year-old young people from the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
The service was accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
By receiving the sacrament of Firmament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
Under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners, the confirmands had prepared for the big feast day in recent months.
In various projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Convention in Untermachtal together.
An Obama voter's cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice, hoping that change was possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone strikes
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book that I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during the gloomy second year of my medical school.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient transcripts in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a speech away.
The election turned into a landslide victory, and news anchors paused to recall the historic significance of that hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a rude awakening, like being torn out of a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic times – they seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multifaceted things Obama has accomplished, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that partisan blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have reached the end of my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows the wiretapping of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives and why whistleblowers who expose government misconduct are punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the findings of a report that said the White House's efforts to silence the media were the "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration".
And recently, it can't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that the work of government could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the office of MP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre dominate the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and half-baked alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had been hearing about for so long.
But with Obama's approval ratings dropping below 45% this week, this book has made the return to 2008 all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week, I read a passage in the book describing how Obama suffered a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with election workers after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Constance: Closure after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-turn lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old man from Constance.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW.
A total of around 15,000 property damage was caused, police said.
The road had to be closed during the accident recording, it said.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to be prepared for higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four in Pfullendorf incurs 70 to 90 euros in additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is set every year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can levy through a levy on the electricity price.
Stadtwerke Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, although the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing the hardships of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to brute force and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known above all as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher has therefore put together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in Garage X on Petersplatz.
The theatre-maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which copulating and masturbating are hinted at - the eight-member ensemble maneuvers through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance whitewashes the original with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get their turn in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their heads under water, stapled to the wall with their evening robes.
Squeezed into cellophane or bodice, they trudge through the production on dangerously high sticks, either monologue loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strained way.
The best moments of the evening are when there is singing - the spectrum ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the exaggerated performance calm down a bit, and Winkler's downright absurd humor flashes up.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of the relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players remaining in the league have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible replacement place.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, a first sigh of relief could not be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure, as long as it is not certain that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," Neckar-Riesen boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23 May, newly promoted Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the court of last instance.
