Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen that is considered particularly dangerous has been extinguished. This was announced by the Normandy prefecture on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 fire engines.
The fire could be stopped
Neighbors were asked not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU&#39;s so-called Seveso Directive, which stipulates particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical plant has made headlines in the past - for example, when methanethiol gas escaped through a leak in 2013 and the area smelled far and wide of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city&#39;s sewage system after an industrial accident.
Woman quits her job to search 57 days for her missing dog
A Washington woman spent two months searching for her missing dog - and quit her job to do it. The seven-year-old border collie escaped from a hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. There was no trace of the bitch for 57 days - but Carole King didn&#39;t give up.
&quot;It was horrible. I felt nauseous,&quot; Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left dog Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel afterwards, Katie was gone. They searched for the animal, but to no avail.
Donner had panicked Dog
Hoping Katie might still be somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to reception. &quot;The clerk says, &#39;She left about four, four and a half hours ago,&#39;&quot; Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. When the automatic front door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Presumably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and appeals to Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But days turned into weeks. &quot;I never gave up. I never lost hope,&quot; Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
&quot;The Tears Flowed&quot;
57 days after Katie&#39;s disappearance, Carole King got a call from a man saying Katie was in his yard. But by the time King got there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was under a tree. &quot;I just hugged her. I didn&#39;t want to let her go,&quot; King recalled, according to Daily Inter Lake. &quot;Tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we found them.&quot;
Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. In most cases, the whereabouts are unclear. The opposition speaks of a &quot;scary&quot; extent.
Weapons and ammunition keep disappearing from the Bundeswehr - many of them without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has lost 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This emerges from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the editorial network Germany reports on.
According to the paper from the office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, a weapon part and 3474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared so far. The weapons and parts of weapons that have still disappeared include six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 rifles, four G36 rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols. In addition, 30 weapon barrels for machine guns of the type MG3 are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr is &quot;scary&quot;, said the left-wing member of the Bundestag Martina Renner. This applies all the more since hardly anything was found again in the course of investigations. The left-wing politician spoke of a &quot;poor balance sheet&quot;. Renner criticized the fact that it was not clear from the list whether the ammunition that had disappeared was found in connection with the investigation into the Bundeswehr officer Franco A., who was suspected of being a terrorist. &quot;Even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of possessing this ammunition,&quot; said Renner.
Oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; left Iranian port
More than two months after being arrested by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; left the port of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker started moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates was specified as the port of destination.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The &quot;Stena Impero&quot; was captured by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Sea Straits of Hormuz on July 19, accused of violating security regulations. It has been suggested, however, that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off Britain&#39;s Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world&#39;s oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had escalated immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the US-Iran conflict. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Chancellor Angela Merkel paid tribute to the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens shook the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU parliamentary group on the upcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor recalled the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. &quot;The state security was taken away from the terror,&quot; she said.
Musk is aiming for a delivery record
Tesla&#39;s quarter may hold a record. Despite the delivery boom, the electric car group recently suffered losses.
New York.Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. &quot;We have a chance to hit our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries,&quot; Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
Demand is strong, allowing Tesla to book 110,000 orders, Musk said in the circular. The challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla must mobilize as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla&#39;s shares went up more than six percent from trading. The price has not increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, which was its best ever.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have recently been losses.
Mystery solved: That&#39;s why we can&#39;t tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin found this out with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on why children resist tickling so fiercely only to then ask for more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before it is touched. This is due to a deep layer in the cerebrum that triggers laughter as soon as you expect to be tickled.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats respond with ultrasonic &quot;laughing&quot; when tickled by humans. This &quot;laughing&quot; is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found out in the experiments on the rats that laughter and the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-touching. This is also the case when living beings clean themselves. During the touching and tickling by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were intensified.
But if the self-touch and the touch of others happen at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat brain cannot differentiate between touching itself and being touched by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-touching activates a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. In doing so, they sometimes broke off this initiation prematurely in the experiment, showed flight behavior or were terrified. This ambivalence resembles the behavior of children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioral response that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Major fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen that is considered particularly dangerous has been extinguished. This was announced by the Normandy prefecture to the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no harmful substances should have escaped. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. Nobody was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was deployed with around 200 fire engines.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were asked not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory is owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett&#39;s Lubrizol company
Additives for lubricants are produced in the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the Lubrizol company owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the EU&#39;s so-called Seveso Directive, which stipulates particularly strict safety requirements. Around 400 people work in the plant.
The chemical plant has made headlines in the past - for example, when methanethiol gas escaped through a leak in 2013 and the area smelled far and wide of rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city&#39;s sewage system after an industrial accident.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister&#39;s sister commented on Boris Johnson&#39;s speech at the first session of Parliament after the compulsory break was lifted on Wednesday evening. The prime minister is threatening to take the country out of the EU without a deal on October 31 if Brussels doesn&#39;t agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit deal. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
The prime minister said of Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union: &quot;The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and to reunite this country would be to leave the EU&quot;. Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya that killed 77, a memorial to honor the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument &quot;Jernrosene&quot; (English: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They commemorate the roses that thousands of people laid in front of Oslo Cathedral in the days and weeks after the attacks.
The project by artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to attend the opening.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then shot dead dozens of participants in a holiday camp run by the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers&#39; Party on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; detained in Iran was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in Iranian President Rouhani&#39;s peace plan.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After approval by the Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The &quot;Stena Impero&quot; has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, explained shipping company boss Erik Hånell. The ship left Iranian waters around noon. &quot;It&#39;s nice that it&#39;s over,&quot; he told Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Office in London described the arrest of the ship as illegal. &quot;This is part of a pattern of attempts to interfere with the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to uphold shipping and international law,&quot; it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the tanker on July 19 on charges of disregarding maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well under the circumstances, Hånell said. You would have behaved professionally in the difficult and stressful situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working on reuniting them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that the arrest of the &quot;Stena Impero&quot; was a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar: A supertanker with oil from Iran, which was said to have been destined for Syria, was chained there in early July. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war country Syria. The British had received the information about the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of &quot;piracy&quot; and threatened consequences. The &quot;Adrian Darya-1&quot; was finally released in mid-August. London vehemently rejected speculation that it was a barter transaction to free the &quot;Stena Impero&quot;.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world&#39;s oil export is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had escalated immensely in recent months. Merchant shipping has been drawn into the US-Iran conflict. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies that. In 2018, the USA single-handedly withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter agreement extended to other areas. Iran has so far resisted the pressure.
Because of the dispute over the &quot;Stena Impero&quot; and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the &quot;Coalition of Hope&quot; initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers.
India is blocking a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a &quot;war profiteer&quot;. In view of the punitive tariffs that America&#39;s President Donald Trump is imposing on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People&#39;s Republic feel compelled to change their plans. CFOs of Asian companies considering moving production from China to another country named India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. Of course, this has nothing to do with the imponderables of the Sino-US trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems destined to play a more important role in the global production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump&#39;s focus. Nicknamed the &quot;kingdom of tariffs&quot; by the White House warhorse, America withdrew trade privileges for 2,000 products from the emerging country at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the friction with India is of course only a sideshow. America also views the world&#39;s largest democracy through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington share concerns about China&#39;s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a volley of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India&#39;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just assumed a second five-year term, should therefore feel safe.
The problem, however, lies elsewhere: the empirically substantiated thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult time in the socialist republic of India. This also applies to Modi. His zeal for reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has for too long stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multinational state. Companies now receive building permits for buildings more quickly. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more effective insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for liquidating seemingly dead companies with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, a lot has changed for the better in India in the first five years of Modi. But that is not the case in trade policy. Inspired by the idea of protecting internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national-conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi has the aura of being an energetic reformer who is radically renovating his country&#39;s economy. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. Essentially, however, the &quot;India First&quot; advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen surviving thanks to their industries being closed are among the core voters of Modi&#39;s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Burial of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency reported, citing the Chiracs family. The burial will take place in close family circles. A public funeral service was scheduled for Sunday in the Invalides in Paris, as reported by the media.
Carried the competitors to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world elite had long since crossed the finish line when heartwarming scenes unfolded in the cold Khalifa International Stadium. In the first heat of the men&#39;s 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to sway dangerously. He could hardly stand with a good 300 meters to go and was running in an unhealthy stoop when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly hooked his arm and supported him the last half lap of the stadium to the finish. However, both of them still had the strength to stop the running wristwatch after crossing the finish line. As if the scene wasn&#39;t weird enough.
&quot;I just wanted to help him. Anyone in that situation would have done the same,&quot; said Dabo after the mixed zone race, when he unexpectedly caught the attention of the assembled journalists. He shyly avoided at first, not wanting to talk about his heroic deed at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the World Cup by the world association. Under normal circumstances he shouldn&#39;t even have started. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m proud to be running for my country here,&quot; he said.
He did that with emphasis that evening - and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this heroic deed will be remembered. Especially since Dabo let his competitor Busby go first at the finish and voluntarily took last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this heat. It was all useless in the end, because Busby, who only crossed the finish line with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation for exactly that reason.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, competed to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: &quot;I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before&quot;. But only in training, where best times don&#39;t count.
Million mash: Egyptians prepare for wild day of protest
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up ahead of possible anti-government protests. An increased police presence was observed in central Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed and streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In the past few days, the police had increased their street checks and searched the cell phones of pedestrians in some cases for messages and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. There hadn&#39;t been such an open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian building contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who lives in exile in Spain and who started the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for a &quot;million march&quot; in central places in the country for today, Friday. Ali calls for a &quot;people&#39;s revolution&quot;. The man isn&#39;t a &quot;good guy&quot; for most young Egyptians because he raked in millions as a subcontractor for the army, but his messages get through.
According to two monitoring groups, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These numbers could not be independently confirmed. The government also did not confirm or comment on the figures.
Arbitrary Arrests
Many people were &quot;arbitrarily arrested&quot; &quot;just because they were &#39;in the wrong place at the wrong time&#39;,&quot; HRW said, citing lawyers for those arrested. According to their lawyers, the allegations against those arrested range from &quot;spreading false information&quot; to membership in a &quot;terrorist organization&quot;. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothes, also randomly questioned and searched passers-by, according to HRW.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mail order companies should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
It is true that companies cannot be exempted from sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry said in response to a question from the Greens parliamentary group, which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday. However, the dealers could set the market value of the unsaleable returns so low that they would have to pay little or no sales tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg determined that Germans send back every sixth package they order online. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost companies additional money, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind as sales on which sales tax is then payable.
Green parliamentary group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree to make it clear that companies can rate products that are not for sale accordingly and donate them to non-profit organizations free of charge. Companies should be able to rely on not being penalized for donating. This applies not only to online trading, but also to other businesses from fashion shops to hardware stores.
Banksy Art Up for Auction: There&#39;s never been a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work by street art star Banksy, &quot;Devolved Parliament&quot;, is to be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy&#39;s work underscores &quot;the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the attitude shaped by animals and tribes&quot;. The painting is set to be exhibited at Sotheby&#39;s in the British capital from Saturday until it is due to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in south-west Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had exhibited the painting again - coinciding with the original Brexit date of March 29. On this occasion, the work formerly called &quot;Question Time&quot; was renamed &quot;Devolved Parliament&quot;.
The picture could change hands for millions.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a tough exchange of blows with the opposition on Wednesday at the first session of the House of Commons after the Supreme Court lifted a forced break imposed by Johnson. Johnson wants to complete the Brexit on October 31, which has already been postponed twice, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. At Dover in south-east England he painted a picture depicting a man breaking a star on the European flag with a chisel. The factory is seen by thousands of lorry drivers and other visitors entering the UK every day.
Brexit debate is like a &#39;walk in the park&#39;
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#39;s violent verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a &quot;walk in the park,&quot; said Dominic Cummings at a book launch on Friday. &quot;We&#39;re enjoying it. We&#39;re going to leave (the EU) and we&#39;re going to win.&quot;
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days, accusing them of &quot;betraying&quot; the people, among other things. He dismissed accusations that he could endanger MPs because they could become the target of death threats as &quot;humbug&quot;.
Cummings said the only way to calm things down was if MPs finally respected Britain&#39;s decision to leave the EU. It&#39;s not surprising that people are upset that the UK still hasn&#39;t left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. &quot;We should speak to each other with respect,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;And we should also listen&quot;.
Pakistan&#39;s Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
At his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, Pakistan&#39;s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict with an emotional appeal.
Otherwise another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, said Khan on Friday at the UN general debate in New York. &quot;When things go badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst.&quot; The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. &quot;You should have prevented that.&quot;
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India revoked the autonomous status of the Indian Kashmir region, suddenly increasing tensions in relations with Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Demonstrators in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is reacting with a heavy hand to the current protests in Egypt. They have the population shot at with live ammunition, and more than 2,000 people arrested join the 60,000 political prisoners who are already being held there. Protesting in Egypt has never been harmless. But since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi came to power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like that of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, a lack of prospects and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government drove millions onto the streets. And that&#39;s a problem that el-Sisi&#39;s regime can&#39;t get a grip on, no matter how tough it is on opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, and the inflation rate is 10 percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who you want to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was the case even before el-Sisi. The Egyptian people have a lot of experience with authoritarian regimes, and the dilemma in the supermarket is also an old one. It always becomes critical when large parts of the population have difficulties even affording a bottle of water.
TÜV tests in the terminal: BER boss: No more &quot;showstoppers&quot; for the capital airport
It was checked for two months whether the complex network of systems in the BER fire protection system worked together. The operators are satisfied with the course. But the TÜV is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale TÜV inspections in the terminal of the future capital city airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said the head of the supervisory board, Rainer Bretschneider, after a meeting of the control committee.
Airport boss Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said there were still deficiencies in the terminal to be worked out. &quot;We have many detailed topics, but we don&#39;t have a real showstopper&quot;. He assured that the timetable until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notification is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020; at the beginning of the year, this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of power cable defects remain to be fixed; the TÜV wants to check this until February. &quot;In order to create the conditions here for the start of flight operations, we must continue to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies,&quot; it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is a matter of missing evidence and less of new cables. There is also no approval for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is not yet working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it&#39;s about smoke curtains that slide down like a canvas in the event of a fire so that the smoke doesn&#39;t spread. You&#39;re going down too far. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, the costs have risen from two billion euros to an estimated 6.5 billion euros when it opens next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That&#39;s what the special meeting of the supervisory board on October 18 should be about, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. CFO Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. You put the airport finances on a solid footing.
Chemnitz: blown up vending machines for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and blew up a number of vending machines in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the past two years, the number of blown up cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply. There was a loss of millions!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstrasse and Further Strasse in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: &quot;In the course of the investigations into causing explosives to explode in conjunction with a particularly serious case of theft, which were conducted by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed.&quot;
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old from Chemnitz now confessed to a total of eight crimes.
The police spokesman: &quot;He apparently financed his addiction to narcotics with the loot.&quot; Between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019 alone, the bomber blew up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstrasse four times.
The resulting total damage amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The automatic bomber is now in custody. The police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic bombings in Chemnitz and neighboring counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over &quot;the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna,&quot; a press spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday. &quot;AviationNetOnline&quot; had previously reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. AUA will take over this from January 2020 in the &quot;we lease&quot;, i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter planes to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman said. The flight times should be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized transport from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a &quot;production company&quot; for the sister company AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be served with an AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings equipment. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under the AUA flight number are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but in Terminal 3, like the AUA.
A price war broke out at Vienna Airport after the Niki bankruptcy. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost airline is sending four Ryanair planes and their crews to Vienna, also in the so-called &quot;we lease&quot;, which the union criticized as a way of circumventing the collective agreement.
Ryanair boss Michael O&#39;Leary&#39;s challenge that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years was countered by AUA board member Andreas Otto on Friday: &quot;We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years&quot;.
Queen&#39;s granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have asked for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month. The palace announced this on Thursday.
&quot;We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to embark on this adventure together and can&#39;t wait to actually be married,&quot; shared the couple, who have been together since October 2018, according to British media reports. in the official communication.
And further: &quot;We share so many similar interests and values and we know that will help us a lot in the years to come filled with love and happiness.&quot;
Nurse Eugenie snapped the pictures
Her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), took the official engagement photos – and published them on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. The palace will announce more details on the date, location and everything else in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to that of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genome of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analyzing the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Swiss scientists want to track down the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, said the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kuehne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Hochgebirgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Obesity, smoking and an unhealthy diet are among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease that can be influenced. Genetic factors help determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it said. The scientists now want to compare the complete genome of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients at the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
According to the hospital, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are currently known to have possible disease-causing changes in the DNA - so-called mutations. About 200 are added every year.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac insufficiency and heart attacks. According to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center, the data could also be used in research into other common diseases. New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kuehne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuehne (82), also emphasized that there was a firm will to use the data to research other diseases. The foundation&#39;s clinic in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be built on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur, who lives in Switzerland, said that he had open-heart surgery in Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also take part in the &quot;Hamburg City Health Study&quot;. According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. When decoding the genome, strict attention is paid to protecting the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It&#39;s about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, a person&#39;s genome can now be decoded within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this would be around 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on October 1, and all 9,000 samples should be analyzed by the end of 2020. The first results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. After information from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. &quot;The victims were mistreated. Some of them said they were raped by their teachers,&quot; Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught the Koran and being &quot;corrected&quot;. In fact, the protégés were held by their teachers under &quot;the most degrading and inhumane conditions,&quot; Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children as young as nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for around ten years. Local residents have drawn the authorities&#39; attention to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They would have known nothing of the suffering of their children. According to the police, the operator and six employees were arrested.
There are many private Koran schools in the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to neighboring Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police free 400 children from school
Police rescued nearly 400 students from appalling conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. &quot;Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture,&quot; said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a tip in an Islamic school. The conditions there were &quot;inhumane&quot;. The officials arrested the principal and six teachers after the liberation.
The children, all boys, were kept like slaves at their school and put in chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in visibly poor health.
World footballer election: More allegations after Messi and Klopp&#39;s freestyle
Football &quot;Signature not valid&quot;
Jurgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe honored
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus a record.
After Nicaragua&#39;s captain declared that he had never voted in the world footballer&#39;s election, allegations came to Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not rated at all - with a curious reasoning.
Many things at Fifa have proven to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by President Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. So far, however, the Fifa world footballer election has not been suspected of being unclean - apart from the fact that the national coaches and national team captains of the member associations who are entitled to vote often vote more for sympathy than for an objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua&#39;s captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now coming to light: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly viewable voting record.
Fifa apologizes in that &quot;the signatures on the ballot forms were in capital letters and were therefore not valid&quot;. The Egyptian association was contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan&#39;s coach also puzzled
There is also outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in Egypt&#39;s case is understandable, the Sudanese FA say coach Zdravko Lugarisic didn&#39;t vote the way it was ultimately judged: with Lionel Messi first, Virgil van Dijk second and Sadio Mané third. According to Fifa, the vote was received in exactly the same way, with signatures and the official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua&#39;s captain Juan Barrera had also made allegations: &quot;Didn&#39;t vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my vote is wrong, thanks,&quot; he wrote. In his case, it has been suggested that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The message came from the association on Friday: That&#39;s right, but of course it wasn&#39;t intentional. According to a statement from the association, the completed election documents were “mistakenly” provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection. But the second captain, Manuel Rosas, actually voted. &quot;We accept responsibility for the administrative error,&quot; the statement said. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, &quot;exactly as it says in FIFA&#39;s official list&quot;.
Fifa is now examining the other cases in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Senior Republicans call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation into US President and fellow party member Donald Trump. &quot;I think the investigation is important,&quot; said Republican Vermont Governor Phil Scott. &quot;Where this goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established.&quot; He wanted to know more about the whistleblower affair before taking any action. Impeachment proceedings can lead to the removal of the President.
Scott said he wasn&#39;t surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj in a telephone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been watching Biden &quot;for years&quot;.
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, and few have expressed any unease about it. Scott&#39;s statements are now a first indication of this in Trump&#39;s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had repeatedly opposed Trump&#39;s policies, such as relaxing environmental protection regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican who spoke out in support of the investigation was Charlie Baker, Gov. of Massachusetts. &quot;It&#39;s a deeply disturbing situation,&quot; Baker said. &quot;The right course of action and the responsibility of Congress now is to investigate and get to the bottom of this.&quot;
As governors of US states, Scott and Baker formally have no say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Your utterances are therefore primarily symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first Republican senators have also expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, Utah&#39;s second chamber representative, said the case was &quot;extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing.&quot; US media are also reporting that cracks are beginning to appear internally among Republicans.
The affair could result in the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abusing his power to exert foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek impeachment. However, the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump&#39;s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed from office through an impeachment process.
Were torturers aboard Rackete&#39;s &quot;Sea Watch&quot;?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she illegally sailed into the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship &quot;Sea Watch 3&quot; and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - including from Austria&#39;s Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now new serious allegations against Rackete are loud. Three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy on the Sea-Watch 3. The suspects have been arrested in a reception center in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. &quot;We cannot rule that out, but we have no reliable information about it ourselves,&quot; said &quot;Sea Watch&quot; spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country. It is about Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). &quot;The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence,&quot; the statement said at the time.
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming onto the ships. &quot;We can&#39;t scan who the people are. They come without passports,&quot; said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. &quot;It is therefore very important that this is investigated.&quot;
Italy&#39;s right-wing former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini immediately demanded an apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
Musk is aiming for a delivery record at Tesla
Tesla boss Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
&quot;We have a chance to hit our first quarter of 100,000 deliveries,&quot; Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by industry blog Electrek.
Demand is strong, allowing Tesla to book 110,000 orders, Musk&#39;s circular said. The challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla must mobilize as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked it: Tesla&#39;s shares went up more than six percent from trading. The price has not increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, which was its best ever.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have recently been losses.
US budget dispute: Again only a bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1st without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding until November 21st.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 budget years, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year that begins on October 1st. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and approved a continuing resolution (CR) until November 21. Without such a decision, there would have been a shutdown at midnight on Monday, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will be financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year, which ends on Monday. This is because Congress was unable to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate funds to the various departments and agencies. For the time being, therefore, the federal administration cannot use the budget of 1.3 trillion for the new financial year. to 1.4 trillion. $ benefit from an expanded spending framework.
Democrats have completed 10 of the 12 bills in the House of Representatives, where they control. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly able to win a majority.
Opinions differ primarily on the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion to build the wall, one of President Trump&#39;s top priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the wall construction plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the construction of the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
Opinions differ on the construction of the Wall
It is currently unclear how the parties intend to approach each other on this issue. An extension of transitional funding beyond November 21 is more likely than agreement on all 12 spending bills in the next seven weeks. A shutdown is also not excluded.
With Congress continuing to fail to agree on the 12 spending bills in a timely manner and the threat of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity. Template p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year&#39;s level, prevent parliamentarians from traveling and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination should also be available to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority in favor of a government bill that would allow all women to use in-vitro fertilization. As a result, the demand for anonymous sperm donations is likely to increase significantly.
The bill still requires Senate approval. During the three-day, emotional debate, critics on the right warned that numerous &quot;children without fathers&quot; could grow up in the future. The French bishops&#39; conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as an &quot;opportunity&quot; for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social security.
Insemination with sperm from dead husband still prohibited
The National Assembly narrowly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to their dead husband&#39;s sperm for artificial insemination. Post-mortem artificial insemination is permitted in Belgium, Spain and Great Britain. In Germany there have been cases in the past in which women have unsuccessfully sued for the release of the sperm of a deceased person. Opponents of the move in Paris argued that a child conceived in this way would then have a &quot;particularly difficult fate&quot;.
Numerous MPs from President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) and MPs from the opposition had spoken out in favor of artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They emphasized that a &quot;double mourning&quot; is imposed on a widow if her desire to have children remains unfulfilled as a result of the death of her husband.
The initiators of the amendment, which has now failed, consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot father children. They must be married or have lived together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single people or lesbian couples.
Compensation payment for the climate: calls for universities to levy their flights are getting louder
A lot is flown at universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The principals say they have no money for it. But now they are also coming under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about a climate tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum again. After the state rectors&#39; conference reacted skeptically to a corresponding initiative from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a teacher training college advocate compensation for official flights. This is &quot;urgently necessary&quot; as a first step, and at the same time there must be a broad debate about the avoidability of flights, according to her statement. The cabinet decision originally planned for July is still on hold because the CDU has still not approved the Greens&#39; proposal.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB secret service, those arrested are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later succumbed to his injuries. This time there were no injuries, it said.
Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters. According to their own statements, the Russian coast guard is patrolling there to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 squid confiscated
During the renewed checks, 30,000 squid were discovered on the boats and confiscated. In addition, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, Russia&#39;s fisheries authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there at times this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about the high level of ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be fetched from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
Only 18,000 in the future: the USA lowers the upper limit for asylum seekers
The &quot;most generous nation in history&quot;: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials in the White House.
The richest country in the world is sealing itself off from those seeking protection: As confirmed by the State Department in Washington, the upper limit for the legal immigration of refugees will be lowered further. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis will be given asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for taking in new refugees again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020 in the United States, a maximum of 18,000 people should be allowed into the country, according to the US State Department. In the now almost over fiscal year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has drastically reduced the willingness to accept people from all over the world seeking protection in recent years. Under the previous administration of Barack Obama, admission limits were much higher.
The targeted upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980. The State Department nevertheless described the US as the &quot;most compassionate and generous nation in history,&quot; a formulation that is strongly reminiscent of the language of the incumbent US president .
&quot;Responsible handling&quot; of refugees aims to ensure that the refugees can return to their home countries to help with reconstruction there, Trump said. He has received a lot of encouragement from supporters for his tough course in migration policy, but there has also been massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. Trump declared a national emergency to finance the construction of a border wall. It is unclear whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Zelenskyi affair and a possible impending impeachment process.
According to the State Department, the US government intends to concentrate on taking in two groups of refugees in the future: people who are being persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger as a result according to the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The USA wants to ensure that people from this &quot;northern triangle&quot; in Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has signed migration agreements, first with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras, in order to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders orangutan released from zoo
A female orangutan has been moved from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a sanctuary for great apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. &quot;Sandra&quot;, who was born in Rostock Zoo in 1986, was granted the rights of a &quot;non-human person&quot;, which is why her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram great ape is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is to live in the open-air enclosure at the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including &quot;Bubbles&quot;, a former pet of pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving to Florida, however, &quot;Sandra&quot; still has to endure a 40-day quarantine at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After being born in Rostock, &quot;Sandra&quot; spent a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The lawsuit initiated by animal rights activists in 2014 over &quot;Sandra&#39;s&quot; fundamental rights has contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education center for the preservation of biodiversity is to be built there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussar ride on the almost 3000 meter high Great Peak in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double bottom or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550 meter high north face of the Great Peak in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, a T-shirt and only supported by an absolute head for heights, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. He undercut the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold now holds the record for free solo speed on four of the six major European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sporting goods manufacturer Nike has posted a significant increase in profits despite the trade conflict with China. Net income rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter. That is 25 percent more than in the same period last year, as the group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new &quot;Nike Direct&quot; marketing strategy, with which the Adidas competitor addresses its customers directly online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion for the three-month period ended August. Nike sales were the strongest in China, up 22 percent. The group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon thus also benefited in the People&#39;s Republic from its approach of addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive forward the sporting goods manufacturer&#39;s &quot;digital transformation&quot; with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted enthusiastically to the quarterly figures - the sporting goods manufacturer&#39;s shares rose by more than five percent.
Lifetime stadium ban for racism in Italy
The club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan because of racist comments about soccer player Juan Jesus from AS Roma. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then released the private messages and urged his club to take action. &quot;@officialasroma you already know what to do with a fan like this. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am,&quot; wrote the 28-year-old, who has been with AS Roma since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan&#39;s account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter should never attend a club game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist abuse against black players from rival teams. &quot;We can&#39;t have racism in society or in sport. The situation hasn&#39;t improved in Italy, and that&#39;s very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums,&quot; Fifa President Gianni Infantino said at the weekend. The reason for the statement were racist chants in the first division game between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Fiorentina last Sunday.
But there had also been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin recently. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 rioting fans of record champions Juventus Turin from the stadium. Four of them were not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, there are bans of four to seven years.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations into 12 leaders of Ultra fan groups linked to Juventus. The twelve are accused of, among other things, severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club started the investigation with a complaint last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are behind the black market in tickets. They &quot;militarily controlled&quot; the ticket trade for the fan curve and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees in order to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole cohorts are given catchy names. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe young people&#39;s attitude towards life?
&quot;The crabs are coming!&quot; With this call, crab fishing at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun officially started on September 21, marking the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, according to the public relations department of Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outskirts of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international &quot;Slow City&quot; in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international &quot;Slow City&quot; movement. From an ecological point of view, the city has ideal conditions with a mixture of &quot;30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields&quot;. The great natural environment of Gaochun provides its residents with all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started raising crabs back in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has become a formative industry that has generated high incomes and become an important part of Gaochun&#39;s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued large-scale, ecological and scientific development of shrimp farming, as well as technology-based shrimp farming. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers&#39; incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform of &quot;distributing power, optimizing management and government services,&quot; and carefully building the &quot;one-roof permit service network, a law enforcement team, a service network, a platform for... lending&quot;. With this, the city wants to comprehensively optimize the environment for permits, for services and for development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages of being connected to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and uses the development zone and its position as an international &quot;slow city&quot; as flagships to build high-end intelligent manufacturing plants, biomedical and medical technology companies , for energy storage and environmental protection, from the culture and health sector as well as companies for ecological agriculture, which are leaders in the &quot;3+2&quot; area, to settle here. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national all-area tourism zone and tourist spots of national importance. It integrated the ecological and cultural resources of Gaochun&#39;s countryside, greatly improved the condition of civic service and civil service buildings, vigorously developed the areas of &quot;Tourism +&quot; and &quot;+ Tourism&quot;, and promoted the development of high-quality cultural tourism. Gaochun&#39;s future is worth looking forward to.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Rouhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
After his return from the UN General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of an alleged offer by the USA to lift sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had promised to end all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: &quot;Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no&quot;.
Ruhani describes what happened as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. &quot;And America says I&#39;m lifting the sanctions,&quot; added Rouhani. The type of sanctions that should be ended was up for debate. &quot;And they clearly said we&#39;re lifting all sanctions.&quot;
However, this advance was not made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticized. In view of the punitive measures in force and &quot;the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure,&quot; no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - almost 200 aftershocks
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a very short space of time, the fear of a catastrophe is growing. 34 people were injured in Tuesday&#39;s earthquake. There have been almost 200 aftershocks since the quake the day before, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases the fear of a catastrophe.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been adequately prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Poorly built residential buildings collapse every year - made weak by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that were registered as places of refuge in the center have long since been built over. It was only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük quake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of Thursday&#39;s quake was in the Sea of Marmara in front of the district of Silivri and at a depth of around seven kilometers, according to the civil protection authority Afad. A few minutes later, a smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that there were initially no reports of injuries or damage. State broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic. Students were taken out of buildings in Silivri district for safety reasons. Some students were crying, as shown in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly prone to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian tectonic plates. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people lost their lives.
Researchers fear a 7.1 to 7.4 magnitude earthquake could threaten. But it is unclear when the earthquake will occur. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies draw up emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need by their front doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big quake will come is unclear.
After returning from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said eight people had been injured. Some buildings suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to him, two minarets of mosques in Avcilar and Sariyer districts collapsed.
Aftershock warning in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. buildings shook. Schools and hospitals have been evacuated. Telephone lines were broken. It was more violent than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned of aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official information, the time of the quake was given as 1:59 p.m. (local time). Just minutes after the initial tremor, there was an aftershock, which measured 4.0 on the Richter scale, according to CNN Turkey.
Only on Tuesday did an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.6 shake the Turkish Marmara region - it could be felt as far away as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also located in the Sea of Marmara west of the metropolis, the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It wasn&#39;t the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. This made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. &quot;These could be the signs of a major earthquake,&quot; Ersoy told the broadcaster. &quot;Sooner or later the big earthquake will come.&quot;
There had already been an incident a few weeks ago - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania just a few days ago - 68 people were injured. The earth also shook at Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, the US Democrats see themselves encouraged: the complaint submitted by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president contains important clues for investigations against the president. Trump once again sees himself as a victim of a &quot;witch hunt&quot;. He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet – plane diverted
A United Airlines flight was diverted after a passenger was trapped in the onboard toilet. The toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said, according to US media.
During an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. She was locked in there for about an hour, the US media wrote, citing other passengers. Passengers had to change planes to fly to San Francisco.
In a video circulating on the Internet, which according to US media is said to have come from Flight 1554, several people can be seen trying to free the woman. &quot;We&#39;re working on opening the door at the moment, ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll get you out soon, okay?&quot; says a man. The airline apologized to all passengers. It was initially unclear whether the woman would receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan Writes Brexit Novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He&#39;s writing a book about it - and its protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka&#39;s famous story &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;, the successful British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel &quot;Die Kakerlake&quot; (Original: &quot;The Cockroach&quot;) will be published in German on November 27, announced Diogenes Verlag (Zurich). It is about the transformation of a man named &quot;Jim Sams&quot;, who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is determined not to let anything or anyone stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying: &quot;If parliament is shut down so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like Soviet leaders once did, if Brexiteers in high places beg for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: to write&quot;. McEwan&#39;s novel &quot;Machines Like Me&quot; about artificial intelligence was only published in the spring.
Kafka&#39;s story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself &quot;transformed into a monstrous vermin&quot;, is gradually excluded from family and society and finally perishes. &quot;Ian McEwan salutes Kafka to describe an upside-down world,&quot; Diogenes Verlag said.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria&#39;s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are being fitted with whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot &quot;Connecting Europe Facility&quot;.
Thomas Cook: All trips canceled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips up to and including October 31, 2019 one day after filing for bankruptcy. Travel could &quot;not be started for reasons of insolvency law,&quot; the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid for in advance or in full. The company left open what the situation was about trips starting on November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was sucked into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs around 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer money to hotels again with immediate effect
On the other hand, starting this Friday, hotels abroad that are currently still accommodating Thomas Cook vacationers will receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, the payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. &quot;This applies immediately and provided that Thomas Cook travelers are not asked by these hotels to pay individual hotel bills or are otherwise required to do so,&quot; said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company was responding to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own statements, had been forced to pay for their accommodation themselves. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance spokesman. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has insured vacation and return travel for Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and to find a solution for the future.
However, the payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance that have now been announced will only help those travelers who are currently still on the road. Things are looking bad for Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on vacation first. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31st would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid for.
The company left open what the situation was about trips starting on November 1, 2019. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. On the Kaera website, customers could find out about options for refunding the travel price and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing Lady Diana&#39;s engagement for a long time. In Africa he is now following in his mother&#39;s footsteps.
Wearing a blue flak jacket, British Prince Harry detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
On Friday morning, in front of the TV cameras, he set up the ignition circuit near a camp run by the British Halo Trust near Dirico. At a safe distance, the explosive device detonated in the savannah landscape without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same explosives expert who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to cover the path that she was walking at the time. The pictures of Princess Diana walking through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She too had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations are faltering: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear decision: With him there will definitely not be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But which statements are of eternal duration with the polarizing Briton. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain hovers over the blond boy like the sword of Damocles. His suspension of Parliament to stubbornly pursue his Brexit course until the exit date was annulled earlier this week. And legislation passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral talks by October 31 if negotiations with the EU fail. However, Johnson had categorically ruled that out again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to go past Johnson noticeably. Meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he hinted that if no agreement was reached by the end of October, he would support an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we&#39;re going to obey the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31st.
And preferably with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and British negotiators still have around six weeks to prevent Great Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But the most recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October currently seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, the withdrawal date will be postponed again. But the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister&#39;s words. She fears that Johnson could somehow push through Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US agency: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to e-cigarette use in the United States has risen to 12. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, said the US health authority CDC. According to a study in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, there were already more than 900 people affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still unclear. So far, no similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe. The complaints appear to be limited to US users.
Fears of new protests in Egypt are growing
Mohammed Ali&#39;s videos have been shared millions of times on online networks. In it, the contractor and actor, who lives in Spain, calls for a &quot;popular revolution&quot;. For today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass rallies with a million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. An increased police presence has already been observed in central Cairo. Several subway stations remained closed and streets around central Tahrir Square were closed. In the past few days, the police had increased their street checks and searched the cell phones of pedestrians in some cases for messages and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There hadn&#39;t been such an open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces reacted accordingly harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arrested arbitrarily - just because they were &quot;in the wrong place at the wrong time,&quot; said HRW, citing lawyers for those arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and in some cases sentenced in recent years.
&quot;Ocean Change&quot;: Arved Fuchs returns from Greenland expedition
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. When he arrived in the port of Hamburg, he was greeted, among others, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht &quot;Malizia&quot;.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had been investigating and documenting the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship &quot;Dagmar Aaen&quot; off the coasts of Iceland and Greenland for the past few months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. For years he had waited for the younger generation to speak up. We have known for decades that the earth is warming. Despite this, many acted as if there was a planet B.
&quot;What happens at sea often takes place behind closed doors,&quot; said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to educate people about the effects of global warming and ocean pollution. During the expedition, Greenland glacier ice was measured with a drone and fished for microplastics with nets, it said.
The polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt received the &quot;Seadevcon Maritime Award&quot; during the Hamburg Climate Week for his &quot;fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world&#39;s oceans&quot;. &quot;For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model,&quot; said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. &quot;He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic over the last few decades.&quot;
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant&#39;Angelo in Rome: That seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The bill, which included a tip of €80, was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which sparked heated reactions.
&quot;Such cases damage Rome&#39;s reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a case of fraud,&quot; demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The restaurant owner responded immediately. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the restaurant owner justified himself. However, this cannot be inferred from the calculation. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is also normal, said the innkeeper.
One call to Ukraine and everything is broken? After the turbulent revelations of the past few days, US President Donald Trump could actually be faced with impeachment proceedings, the Democrats now want to examine this as quickly as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - we are talking about weeks before a decision is made.
The phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is said to be at the beginning of the scandal. The allegation of the whistleblower, who finally brought the conversation to the public with his complaint out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the USA, is monstrous: The President abused the power of his office to use the government of another country for a To exploit influence on the 2020 election. He used Ukraine&#39;s dependence to blackmail and wanted to force her to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be understood in the transcript of the conversation with Zelenskyj, which has since been published, although it does not reproduce the full text. The July 25 phone call is just one episode in a much larger story, which, in addition to Trump, focuses primarily on his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins in public view in May 2019 when the New York Times reported on Rudy Giuliani&#39;s plans to travel to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Zelenskyy, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. &quot;We&#39;re not interfering in an election, we&#39;re interfering in an investigation, which we have the right to do,&quot; he told the newspaper. You might think it&#39;s inappropriate, but &quot;there&#39;s nothing illegal about it.&quot; Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is little basis - &quot;because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could turn out to be helpful to my government&quot;.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixated on Trump&#39;s opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton colluded with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to provide a reason for the Russia investigation in Ukraine to construct the USA. However, this accusation was never taken seriously.
It is about exactly the investigations that Trump will talk about so prominently on the phone with Zelenskyj in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is that the former Vice President and currently a promising candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration&#39;s Ukraine representative, pushed for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin. This was to stop the investigation he was responsible for into the gas company, on whose board his son Hunter Biden served. Biden Sr. has been financially blackmailing Ukraine to cover up his family&#39;s corrupt activities.
In fact, the process was a little different. By the time Joe Biden demanded that Ukraine&#39;s attorney general go, the investigation into the gas company had already been completed, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. In addition, Shokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, and the US government was by no means the only Western partner pushing for his release. Incidentally, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Malfunctions with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide are reporting massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are particularly affected. On the website allestör.de, users report that Facebook hasn&#39;t loaded again and again since around 3:30 p.m. Instagram also gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. are often affected by disruptions
It&#39;s not the first major incident this year. The services had already failed for several hours in March and July. And as in previous cases, users are turning to Twitter in particular to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were traveling in an inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in misfortune - the Chilean rescue helicopter needed less than an hour for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
&quot;We got the message at 9:30 a.m., we started shortly before ten, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the dinghy&quot;.
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Caution: NEVER charge your smartphone wirelessly
Convenient but harmful
Although inductive technology via the Qi standard is extremely practical, it should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come onto the market that support wireless charging and are selling very well - above all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperatures clog the battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a cell phone normally with a cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. With wireless charging, however, the researchers always measured more than 30 degrees, even when the smartphone was perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up power consumption.
capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, temperature is a key factor in battery life. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, it also doesn&#39;t last as long overall. The service life is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore recommend always charging the smartphone with a cable. Since replacing the battery in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple recently increased the cost of replacing the battery again - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of tangled cables and laborious plug fumbling. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) is a worldwide standard that even Apple takes part in exceptionally, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest traffic jam photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer claims to have climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project &quot;Mission Possible&quot;. He has made international headlines before: a photo of mountaineers queuing on Mount Everest that went viral in spring came from him.
The image of the crowds sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died within a few days while climbing.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eight-thousander: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Bad weather is one of the reasons given. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal&#39;s government wanted to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants found in Sri Lanka
A pregnant elephant cow was among the dead animals, a police spokesman said on Friday. &quot;We suspect that the elephants were poisoned&quot;.
The four bodies were found in a sanctuary near the famous former rock fortress of Sigiriya, which is visited by many tourists. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Almost 200 elephants are killed in Sri Lanka every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, killing them is punishable by death.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being seized by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Authority, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards detained the British-flagged tanker on July 19, alleging disregard for maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook management criticized
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. It is said to be about the salary packages for the board of directors as well as the question of why the British government did not want to help the company, which was struggling to survive, financially. &quot;We are interested in oversight within the firm as well as oversight by outside auditors,&quot; said committee chair Rachel Reeves in London. &quot;Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of managerial greed.&quot;
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the increased risk of colon cancer in families has apparently been overestimated to date. This is the conclusion reached by researchers at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family eating habits, are therefore probably more important than previously assumed. The DKFZ scientists emphasize that this has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares soar
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek on Thursday (local time). Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk&#39;s circular said.
The challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly. To do this, Tesla must mobilize as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla&#39;s shares went up more than six percent from trading. The price has not increased so much in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, which was its best ever.
Musk needs records to achieve his lofty goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have recently been losses.
British government wants to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reticent
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile on whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the law against a no-deal Brexit recently passed by Parliament. In response to a question about this, he simply told journalists on Friday that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticized this as a &quot;surrender law&quot; that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson might try to use &quot;political chicanery&quot; to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that postponed the entry into force of the law until after the exit from the EU.
Johnson said he wants a deal with the European Union. &quot;We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31 and the best way is with an agreement.&quot;
Iran appears to be ramping up uranium enrichment
Iran&#39;s President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on the European contracting parties in the dispute over saving the historic nuclear deal. &quot;Unfortunately, the European states are showing inability or a lack of willingness when it comes to concrete action,&quot; Rohani said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they did not live up to their promises, he promised &quot;further steps&quot; away from the provisions of the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained a promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The United States single-handedly withdrew from the agreement in 2018 in order to use &quot;maximum pressure&quot; to force Iran to change course in what was considered aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump&#39;s government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now back to tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently reacted to this by restarting the uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium, or at least has prepared them for use. According to the IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to take their share of the deal and are therefore leaving the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani speculated. But there will still be further talks, which hopefully will bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran&#39;s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on an important oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. The Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen originally claimed responsibility for the attack, but the US saw this as a false claim. &quot;We have nothing to do with it,&quot; Rohani reiterated his position on Wednesday.
&quot;Those making such allegations must provide evidence,&quot; Rouhani said. However, the European leaders could not have done that in talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they only argued that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. Rouhani had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past few days.
Rouhani demanded that the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration be lifted before any talks could be held with US President Trump. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of &quot;dialogue and reason&quot;.
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from deep space. That worked once before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially just a guess has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The deep-space comet, named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer, has attracted the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennady Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a homemade telescope with a diameter of 65 centimeters. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object sighted during a transit of our solar system, after 1I/&#39;Oumuamua from 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get an up-close look at an alien solar system before it vanishes, never to be seen again. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. &quot;The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun at this distance,&quot; said Davide Farnocchia of the US space agency Nasa in a statement.
According to the analyzes, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which leads it out of our system - and is clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. She is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which was initially listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object to be discovered discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/&#39;Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already sighted on approach. This gives the researchers many months for investigations. &quot;The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and can then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020,&quot; explained Farnocchia. &quot;After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020.&quot;
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. A team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/&#39;Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to be between 2 and 16 kilometers in an initial study. Images from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. &quot;The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar,&quot; reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León&#39;s colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way of studying certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such flying visits are. A planned satellite mission by the European space agency Esa could possibly intercept one of the next interstellar visitors.
The agency wants to station the three-part &quot;Comet Interceptor&quot; spacecraft in a holding position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028. According to ESA Science Director Günther Hasinger, it should either be lurking for an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I/&#39;Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing&#39;s new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time for the People&#39;s Republic&#39;s 70th birthday, the first China United Airlines passenger plane has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers a year should be handled at the new airport, and by 2025 it should be 72 million. China&#39;s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. The latest prestige project in China is also called &quot;starfish&quot; because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world&#39;s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 and is much smaller, has been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, the first passenger plane landed after just four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that&#39;s what the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams of. The US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as saying that this supersonic flight, which is targeted for the 2030s, is to be made possible by a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire is developing. &quot;This is the technology that could definitely do that,&quot; agency boss Graham Turnock told the broadcaster. &quot;We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning and the work is already very advanced&quot;.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic passenger aircraft to date, the Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until it ceased operations in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours to do so. In 2000, an accident occurred when a Concorde was taking off at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, killing all 109 people on board. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the &quot;X-Plane&quot;, together with the US space agency Nasa. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its program.
&quot;Saber will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport,&quot; writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its website. The Saber drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that&#39;s five times faster than sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere and thus enable the &quot;next generation of truly reusable frame vehicles&quot;.
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipsters in the Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
&quot;I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information,&quot; Trump said Thursday to staff at the US Legation to the United Nations in New York. The person concerned is almost &quot;a spy&quot; and in the past such people were dealt with &quot;a little differently&quot; than today.
This was seen as an attempt to intimidate tipsters. The event was actually not open to the public. However, several US media broadcast audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats were outraged by the president&#39;s statement.
The Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced on Tuesday preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump. Their allegations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee who raises serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. Due to great public pressure, the whistleblower&#39;s descriptions were made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower claims to have received information from several government officials that the US President is &quot;using the power of his office&quot; to get another country to interfere in the 2020 US election on his behalf.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigate that could damage his political rival Joe Biden. It&#39;s about Biden&#39;s son Hunter&#39;s previous dealings in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary. Biden is ahead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of a cover-up with regard to the Ukraine call: top government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the call under the covers. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was prepared. After the conversation, this was removed from a database usually provided for this purpose on the instructions of lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The whistleblower&#39;s identity is not publicly known. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that it should be an employee of the foreign intelligence agency CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the &quot;so-called whistleblower&quot; had spread second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate. Therefore, there may be no tipsters or spies.
Trump&#39;s comments in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower caused outrage. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with concern and complained that Trump&#39;s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations into Trump and those around him have been going on for months in various committees. In view of the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pursuing investigations with renewed vigour, in order to initiate a possible impeachment process against Trump.
&quot;The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation,&quot; House Intelligence Committee chief Adam Schiff said. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accusing him of misrepresenting things and again calling for the resignation of the committee chair. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, most of whom served under Democratic but also Republican presidents, backed the Democrats&#39; investigation into a possible impeachment trial in a statement released Friday. If the allegations are true, it would be &quot;an unscrupulous abuse of power&quot; by Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment process. However, the decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump&#39;s Republicans have the majority. The prospects of success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed from office through an impeachment process.
VW works council: Jobs are being &quot;gradually&quot; cut
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the works council of the car manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros by two billion euros by 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
Personnel costs are a key factor here. The &quot;future pact&quot; negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs by 2020 in Germany alone. Basically, a job can only be cut at the car manufacturer if it can be proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. In addition, there is job security until 2029.
As our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production that are not actually up for grabs are being &quot;creepingly&quot; cut in a different way - in other words, bypassing the official course. Regular positions that become vacant are often not filled again.
In these cases, the works council has no way of forcing a replacement. In the meantime, there is a lack of staff in many places, work intensification is increasing, and concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants are growing. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW only said: &quot;As agreed, the volume of employment will be adjusted in a socially acceptable manner along the demographic curve&quot;.
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the goal behind this is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production Director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: &quot;Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof&quot;.
There have already been successes on this path: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle have fallen compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on October 24, will be reduced by 1.1 hours. VW does not give exact figures for the production time, according to information from our newspaper, the Golf 7 is around
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory that produces vehicles. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW&#39;s rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling demand for diesel and the problems with the conversion to the new consumption and exhaust gas test method WLTP.
As Production Director Tostmann announced last year, a million cars are to roll off the assembly line in Wolfsburg &quot;in the future&quot;. This should make the bundling of Golf production in the main plant possible - because the Zwickau plant is giving up Golf production due to the conversion to the location for e-car production.
The Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) SUVs are also produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of the Golf and Tiguan have recently been declining. Therefore, expectations now rest on the Golf 8. Despite all efforts to develop e-mobility, it should remain the bread-and-butter car of Wolfsburg for the time being.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria were sworn to, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected human traffickers have to go to prison.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to suspended and imprisonment terms of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The accused had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian women who wanted to leave the country had to take a ritual oath before a voodoo priest while they were still at home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were taken across the Mediterranean in rubber boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Once in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels in order to work off the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wages were therefore taken from them completely.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the smuggling and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women to brothels in the process. &quot;The work made the women physically and mentally difficult to create,&quot; said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. &quot;Some were really disgusted&quot;.
The verdicts are commercial and gang smuggling of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendants&#39; union Ufo has again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will &quot;inform you about the industrial action in the LH Group on October 14,&quot; said UFO collective bargaining board member Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate wages with UFO for months. It is also about the question of whether the union has lawfully terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labor Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements had not been terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company upheld the decision and is considering appealing the decision. &quot;I think it&#39;s unlikely that a second court will see things completely differently,&quot; said UFO board member Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Frankfurt Regional Labor Court to have the status of the UFO as a trade union reviewed by a court. The company argues that the union has not appointed a representative board for months and is therefore unable to fulfill its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, in the course of which numerous members of the board and advisory board resigned, including long-time union boss Nicoley Baublies. Due to doubts about its leadership, the UFO suspended a ballot that had already begun on strikes by cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not exactly been known as an international tourist magnet. But that should change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. According to the Tourism Commission, the number of international and domestic visitors is to be increased to 100 million per year by 2030.
&quot;The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,&quot; said Tourism Commission Chairman Ahmad Al-Khatib.
So far, Saudi Arabia has been difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only issued for short business trips, religious pilgrimages, or visitors with dependents in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more income from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country&#39;s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production plummeted and oil prices shot up. It may take several weeks for the kingdom&#39;s oil production to return to previous levels.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for their wedding feast
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time), where she can be seen in the white wedding look. According to People magazine, reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including ones printed with bananas, on Instagram and asked his followers: &quot;Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding&quot;. According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married in a church next weekend.
The Biebers tied the knot a year ago at a New York registry office. There wasn&#39;t a bigger festival back then.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found common ground after initial problems: &quot;If you don&#39;t want to compromise, you can&#39;t have a relationship&quot;.
Two dead in Czech plane crash
Two people died in a small plane crash in western Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police said. The dead are a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also involved in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is around 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers north-east of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-native species, unsustainable logging and urban growth are also causes of the threat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. She examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 would already be at the highest level of endangerment and thus on the verge of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: from &quot;Near Threatened&quot; to &quot;Vulnerable&quot;, &quot;Endangered&quot;, &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; and &quot;Extinct in the wild&quot; to &quot;Extinct&quot;. In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Mountain ash and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, rowan trees (Sorbus) are particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. &quot;Most are threatened because populations are small anyway, or through conversion or degradation of their habitats.&quot;
Things are also looking bad for the wild horse chestnuts. They have been classified as &quot;Vulnerable&quot;, level two on the IUCN scale, since 2017. Besides a fungus, the biggest threat is the Balkan leaf miner. It has been spreading from south-eastern Europe across the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at fewer than 10,000 specimens. Trees in cities, parks and avenues are not taken into account in this assessment.
Shrub species and mosses are also at risk
At the same time, IUCN scientists produced new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than a fifth of mollusks and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Mollusks such as snails play a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
&quot;This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of Europe&#39;s ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,&quot; said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office. &quot;We must limit human impact on our ecosystems and make protecting these species a priority.&quot;
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 injured reported
The recent earthquake in Turkey injured 34 people. According to the information, there were no deaths. Dozens of people had to leave their homes and 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. There have been almost 200 aftershocks since the tremor the day before. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake shook the Marmara region off Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, announced Oktay. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been adequately prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly prone to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian Fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian tectonic plates.
One of the most powerful was a 7.6 magnitude tremor near Istanbul in 1999. At that time, the epicenter was in Gölcük, south-east of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people lost their lives.
A magnitude 4.6 earthquake had already shaken the region around Istanbul on Tuesday. Authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show at the next American football final, the Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. &quot;It doesn&#39;t get any bigger,&quot; Shakira captioned a photo of herself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to be on the Super Bowl stage. February 2, 2020 will be the day in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she&#39;s dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross take to the skies at the halftime show. &quot;Now it&#39;s even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I&#39;ll be performing with another Latina.&quot; She can&#39;t wait &quot;to show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world&quot;.
Shakira said in a statement she was honored to join another artist on one of the largest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. &quot;And then on my birthday too!&quot; The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two &quot;queens&quot; were on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York to parents from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American football season. The game and halftime show are among the most watched television broadcasts in the United States. Even if the number of viewers has recently fallen: This February, the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers in more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been an uproar in the run-up to the halftime show of the last Super Bowl: According to media reports, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in the dispute over how to deal with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 headlined the halftime show - the reviews were not very kind.
Kaepernick, then quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, got on his knees before NFL games during the 2016/17 season at the national anthem to protest police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, and numerous players took over the gesture. This caused a great deal of excitement, and US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been without a club since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook bankruptcy: Hotels get money from the insurance company
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dearly. There is a risk of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in its Friday edition.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would have to write off their books by up to 1.8 billion pounds sterling (around 2 billion euros). That would have been shown by estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Bondholders would face write-downs of between £900m and £1bn and lenders between £550m and £825m. The actual amounts to be written off are likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the newspaper.
How big the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end will become apparent after the end of the insolvency proceedings. One person close to this trial didn&#39;t seem too hopeful. For example, Thomas Cook&#39;s 40 or so aircraft in the UK are &quot;old&quot; and many of the properties are in poor locations. The most money could probably be made with the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it said.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. &quot;We cannot rule it out, but we have no reliable information about it ourselves,&quot; said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, of the dpa news agency.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception center in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer emphasized that the refugee organizations could not check who they let on their ships. &quot;They come without passports&quot;.
Carola Rackete illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29, ramming a ship belonging to the Italian financial police. The three suspects are said to have arrived there that day. The captain is under investigation for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
US warns federal government about Huawei
The head of the US Internet authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great,&quot; Pai told the &quot;Handelsblatt&quot; with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a &quot;national security law&quot; that obliges every company &quot;under Chinese jurisdiction&quot; to follow the instructions of the security organs.
Applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,&quot; the FCC chief continued. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has now agreed to require a &quot;declaration of trust&quot; from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the &quot;Handelsblatt&quot;, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
The software is particularly important to keep the devices up to date. This software is made up of billions of lines of code that change over time,&quot; Pai said.
It is &quot;very difficult to imagine&quot; that a government agency, &quot;no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks,&quot; the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close ties to the Chinese state apparatus:
Ownership is unclear. The employee company that allegedly owns the company is not necessarily independent of the government,&quot; Pai told Handelsblatt.
The United States has evidence that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the US position.
Chemical plant in northern France on fire: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire lights up the sky above a chemical plant in northern France. The fire was extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
As a precaution, the facilities in twelve municipalities would not open on Friday, the responsible prefecture announced. The Interior Ministry had urged citizens to stay indoors as much as possible and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders have been urged to bring their animals indoors, protect their feed and stop harvesting for the time being.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk of odor spreading after the deletion, the prefecture said on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the scene of the fire.
A gigantic column of black smoke had previously risen from the chemical plant. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the factory of the Lubrizol company, which produces oil additives. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are specially monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso, near Milan, Italy.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news broadcaster BFMTV that initially no &quot;high toxicity&quot; was found in samples. However, pollution of the nearby Seine cannot be ruled out. Dams have been built in the river to prevent pollution, the prefecture said.
The fire broke out around 2:40 a.m. in the early morning, authorities said. The cause initially remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French finance minister: &quot;Germany must invest now&quot;
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the euro zone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better,&quot; said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The minister warned that the economy in the euro zone was weakening.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to take the necessary decisions.&quot;
Those states that have budgetary leeway for more investment would have to act, said Le Maire, with a view to Germany, among other things.
France does not have this leeway, the minister added, referring to his country&#39;s high national debt. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French national debt must be &quot;stabilized&quot; and &quot;reduced&quot;, said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is reacting to the protests of the yellow vest movement, among other things. New borrowing is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson dodges question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson has sharply criticized the &quot;surrender law&quot; passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. But critics fear Boris Johnson could still exploit a loophole. However, when asked about this possibility, the Tory politician dodged it.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a low profile on whether he wants to push through a no-deal Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament to prevent exactly that. When asked about this, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would abide by the law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the exit date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticized this as a &quot;surrender law&quot; that made negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major suggested on Thursday that Johnson might try to use &quot;political chicanery&quot; to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that would postpone the entry into force of the law until after the exit from the EU. Johnson said he wants a deal with the European Union. &quot;We are confident of leaving the EU on October 31 and the best way is with an agreement.&quot;
Meanwhile, Johnson&#39;s chief adviser Dominic Cummings said he saw the political disputes about Brexit as a &quot;walk in the park&quot; and was confident that the planned exit from the EU would still come about: &quot;We&#39;re enjoying it, we&#39;ll win, we&#39;ll (Note. d. Red.: leave the EU), don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Cummings, according to the British newspaper &quot;Telegraph&quot;, at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, is now chief strategist at Downing Street. He is said to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
&quot;The Polaroid Diaries&quot; by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn&#39;t always have to be glamour. The photo book &quot;The Polaroid Diaries&quot; (bags) delves deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until Linda&#39;s death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the illustrated book &quot;The Polaroid Diaries&quot; at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Other illustrious guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
Posting the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram, &quot;#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary pre-Instagram family, a celebration of LindaMcCartney&#39;s legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film.&quot;
For Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona before she discovered photography, the camera was always with her. She has made thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now being published for the first time in &quot;The Polaroid Diaries&quot;.
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70&#39;s to the late 90&#39;s. &quot;She wanted real moments,&quot; writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course one person is always the center of attention: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, makes phone calls in a bathrobe with a bag on his head, or wears bulky moon boots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also lived normal lives away from the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that as a baby she slept in a bed her father had made from old potato boxes. And things weren&#39;t always tidy with the McCartneys either.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney&#39;s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It&#39;s about the decisive click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment,&quot; said Paul McCartney. &quot;If you shoot two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo.&quot; And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. &quot;She just knew she had it,&quot; Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the picture section and the colors are all right, which not only makes &quot;The Polaroid Diaries&quot; an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to everything anecdotal, where landscapes sometimes seem abstract paintings work. The perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
&quot;We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran&quot;
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighboring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot cancel oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,&quot; Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil because some companies &quot;withdrew because of US threats&quot;.
Nevertheless, Turkey &quot;will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues,&quot; said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since withdrawing from the international nuclear deal with Iran, the United States has been pursuing a policy of &quot;maximum pressure&quot; on the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to a collapse in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. Tensions in the Gulf region have escalated significantly in recent months.
The US government wants to limit the intake of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The US State Department said on Thursday that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said the US would remain committed to helping refugees. But the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. The US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The US government wants to focus on taking in two groups of refugees going forward: people who are being persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have become endangered as a result, according to the State Department statement emerges. A maximum of 1,500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Launched in 1980, the program selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for budget year 2020 would be the lowest in the program&#39;s history. Even the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low. When US President Donald Trump&#39;s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the announced lowering of the upper limit. &quot;This is a very sad day for America,&quot; said International Rescue Committee chief David Miliband. By doing so, the US would further damage its leadership in protecting the world&#39;s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, both legal and illegal. According to the US government, it expects 350,000 asylum applications in the coming budget year. These numbers are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - &quot;Comes close to an informer&quot;
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage. Whoever gave the informant who accused him of abuse of power &quot;comes close to an informer,&quot; Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This is reported by several US media unanimously.
Accordingly, Trump spoke to employees of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied: &quot;That&#39;s close to a snitch&quot;. Then Trump added, &quot;You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. The spies and treason, we used to deal with that a little differently than we do now.&quot;
Observers interpreted the latter remark as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump&#39;s statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It is also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment trial against him, wrote the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees.
In a complaint that has now been published, the whistleblower accuses the President of abusing his office to request another country to interfere in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyj in the summer: During the conversation, Trump suggested that he initiate investigations into his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst with the CIA.
Refugee boat capsizes: Baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Again and again people try to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea. The boats, which are often far too small, regularly capsize. When a rubber dinghy went down, seven migrants died - including five children.
Seven migrants died when a rubber dinghy sank off the Greek island of Chios. A baby and four other children were among the fatalities, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
A smuggler is said to be among the victims, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which countries the migrants come. Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in boats that are far too small. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year.
The Who cancel concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of lead singer Roger Daltrey&#39;s illness. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the crowd, &quot;I think I should skip it while it&#39;s still going&quot;.
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey &quot;really can&#39;t speak right now&quot;. Townsend promised the audience that he would get his money&#39;s worth at a redemption concert. However, a date has not yet been set.
The Who canceled performances scheduled for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. They should be made up for at a later date. Daltrey, 75, and his 74-year-old bandmate, Townsend, are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork has grown from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear billions in income.
The crisis at the office landlord WeWork threatens to upset the balance on the world&#39;s largest real estate markets. The company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as boss a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as private jets for executives in order to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British &quot;Financial Times&quot; reports, among others, that WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. As a result, the largest tenant of office space in New York and London, among other places, is suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces on a long-term basis and then rents them out to members in small units for the short term. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money at breathtaking speed with this business. Last year the company lost $1.6 billion on sales of $1.8 billion. This year, rental costs alone are said to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars due to the leasing of more and more large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is said to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. Those huge liabilities could pose a problem not just for the company and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months. WeWork&#39;s new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new space that had come onto the market during this period. Without WeWork&#39;s expansion, office vacancies in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in &quot;Business Insider&quot;. The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in prime locations.
In the British capital, too, the balance on the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion by the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant in an office building in the center of the financial metropolis that was bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have invested heavily in converting their properties to meet WeWork&#39;s requirements. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, property owners will probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in revenue. Despite the long-term leases, they do not have access to WeWork&#39;s - already scarce - reserves. Because the individual WeWork locations are usually rented by specially founded subsidiaries, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable to a limited extent.
Russia arrested scores of North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coast guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past few days, a total of 262 poachers who had been fishing illegally in the waters had been arrested, the Russian domestic secret service FSB said on Friday, according to the Interfax agency.
Just ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. The border guards had previously been fired upon and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters. According to their own statements, the Russian coast guard is patrolling there to protect their marine biological resources. During the renewed checks, 30,000 squid were discovered. In addition, according to the information, three fishing boats and two motor boats were confiscated and taken to Nakhodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the Ria Nowosti agency, the Coast Guard identified more than 8,000 violations in 2018
Even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, the Russian fisheries authorities had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea were temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently complained about the high level of ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be fetched from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose. The ships themselves also do not comply with the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian coast guard were injured in the arrests in the previous week. According to the FSB, a North Korean who was also wounded later died of his injuries. On that September 17, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
US imposes travel ban on ex-President Castro
The US has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The US State Department justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro&#39;s involvement in &quot;gross violations of human rights&quot;. As head of the Caribbean country&#39;s Communist Party, he presides over a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also complicit in human rights violations there by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. &quot;The Cuban regime&#39;s disregard for human rights and use of force to prop up the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela,&quot; US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump issued entry bans on Wednesday against members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle has been raging between the government and the opposition for months. The US has imposed a slew of sanctions on Maduro&#39;s government in a bid to bring him to his knees and put opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaidó in power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro&#39;s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to estimates by the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also dispatched numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands upon thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strikes, the Fridays for Future movement is again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. Because of the time difference, New Zealand and Australia should start before the protests spread across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how great the worldwide response will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was in good spirits. &quot;Last Friday over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we&#39;ll do it again!&quot; she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
In Germany in particular, the influx was very large last Friday. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all demonstrators worldwide - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a listing by the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. In major cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg sat down in front of the Swedish parliament to call on her country&#39;s politicians to do more to protect the climate. The Fridays for Future movement emerged from this within a short period of time. Schoolchildren and students in particular take part in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against global warming and the impending climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be contained to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic trip on an ocean-going racing yacht. There she had recently taken part in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she delivered an emotional speech at the UN, in which she appealed to the consciences of world leaders. In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize by the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. &quot;This also applies to smoking,&quot; said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergencies on Thursday in Moscow, according to the TASS agency. The ban is set to come into effect on October 1.
Anyone who still smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette ignites a fire, the penalty will be higher. According to the ministry, burning candles are also covered by the ban. Grilling meat skewers on the balcony is also no longer permitted.
Strike against cybercriminals - investigators dig out servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have dug up a large server provider for illegal business on the dark web for the first time.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as operators of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which international criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday evening. The dark web is a shielded part of the internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world&#39;s second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, &quot;Wall Street Market&quot;, which investigators had broken up in the spring. According to the Attorney General, the attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled via a server in the cyberbunker.
Such a hoster had been raised for the first time in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighboring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, the investigators want to provide more details.
New worldwide climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands upon thousands of people want to take to the streets again today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international week of climate strikes, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a mass rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests ǀ Who are Thunberg&#39;s backers?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming the climate. It is all the more astonishing that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror in front of the powerful people of the time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical feat or manipulative tactic for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is getting the masses moving and young people standing up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person has managed to win over a crowd of children and young people. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt he had been chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he was also able to win over a group of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made a journey to America with a sailing boat.
But is there a downside to this? Why does it take a stock called &quot;We don&#39;t have time&quot; to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. Incidentally, her mother has published a book which has sold widely thanks to her daughter being in the spotlight. Even tried and true followers of Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some of the successors. This is also not unfounded, because the campaign was very well received in the media worldwide and a lot of money is flowing thanks to the impressive campaign.
This is where opinions differ: is it morally right to enrich oneself financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter which position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democratic society, because democracy thrives on different opinions and discussions. It can therefore make sense to critically question the seemingly pious intentions of certain trendsetters.
Comet Spotted: Interstellar Guest Cruising Through Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: a foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is crossing our solar system at the moment. It was named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
Said body was discovered in Crimea by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borissov. He looked up at the sky with a home-made telescope, and further follow-up observations confirmed his initial suspicions. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to have been spotted flying through.
The big chance for astronomers is now to get a close look at an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which is taking it out of our system.
Comet was sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before that happens, astronomers can observe it closely. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted on its approach, which means it can be studied from Earth for many months. &quot;The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and can then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020,&quot; explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. &quot;After that, it will only be observable with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020.&quot;
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 &quot;Oumuamua&quot;.
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to have a diameter of 2 to 16 kilometers. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the tail star&#39;s spectrum is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through processes similar to ours, added de León&#39;s colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may open up a new path for investigating certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep researchers busy. A giant asteroid just sped past Earth, coming dangerously close.
&quot;Absolutely reprehensible&quot;: Rachel Johnson appalled by her brother
Things are getting lonelier around Boris Johnson. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister clearly castigates the prime minister&#39;s warlike language as &quot;tasteless&quot;. It&#39;s not the brother she knows.
&quot;Capitulation&quot;, &quot;fraud&quot;, contract: Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly arming himself - at least verbally Word reported: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation as if those opposed to leaving the EU should be &quot;hanged, stretched, quartered, tarred and feathered&quot;. She thinks that is extremely reprehensible. She doesn&#39;t recognize her brother&#39;s version, said Rachel Johnsons, who ran for the anti-Brexit party Change UK in the EU Parliament elections.
She was particularly offended when her brother mentioned Jo Cox, a pro-EU MP who was murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 exit referendum. The best way to honor their memory is to go through with Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons. &quot;It&#39;s very distasteful to refer to an MP who was murdered by someone shouting &#39;Britain first&#39;,&quot; Johnson&#39;s sister said. The perpetrator apparently came from the right-wing extremist camp, which felt empowered &quot;by this kind of language&quot;. For all those who mourned her, it was very tasteless.
Cox&#39;s widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. &quot;It makes me sick when Jo&#39;s name is used like that,&quot; he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up passionately and resolutely for what you believe in - no matter what your beliefs are. But you should never &quot;demonize the other side&quot;. He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson&#39;s younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and as a Tory MP. &quot;I&#39;ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest over the past few months - it&#39;s an irresolvable tension,&quot; Jo Johnson said.
Johnson&#39;s language also drew sharp criticism from within the church. As the &quot;Times&quot; reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language, which is &quot;not worthy of this country&quot;. In a joint statement, they said: &quot;In the past few days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak to each other with respect&quot;.
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is setting a strong example: Two women with Latino roots will appear in the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl. They promise &quot;an explosion of fun and energy&quot;.
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the US football league NFL. The organizers announced this on Thursday (local time).
&quot;I&#39;m incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, which is incredibly strong in the United States,&quot; Shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th anniversary next year, will take place in Miami on February 2nd. Many people with Latin American roots live in the metropolis on the southern tip of Florida. Shakira (&quot;Waka Waka&quot;) is from Colombia, Lopez (&quot;On the Floor&quot;) is of Puerto Rican origin.
&quot;I love that this time the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage - and two Latinas,&quot; Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises &quot;an explosion of fun and energy&quot; for the show.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she had big hits with songs like &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s Get Loud&quot; and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama &quot;Hustlers&quot; in German cinemas from November.
Shakira rose to fame in Colombia as a telenovela star and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and single &quot;Whenever, Whereever&quot;.
The announcement of the halftime guests is always eagerly awaited in the USA. This year, many see the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least because of President Donald Trump&#39;s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL finals, and it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
Political controversy arose in the run-up to the event last year. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up when the national anthem was played in protest of police violence against black people and had been attacked harshly by US President Donald Trump, among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 performed was ultimately criticized by many.
An actor and YouTuber puts pressure on Egypt&#39;s rulers: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who are influential in bringing blood back to Egypt&#39;s streets have both spent the past week abroad. One of the two floated back into Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 deposed the Muslim Brotherhood Mohammed Morsi, the country&#39;s first freely elected head of state, had a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi&#39;s actions against political Islam and not a syllable about human rights violations lost on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt&#39;s security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest against the president. He had &quot;no reason to worry,&quot; said Sisi at the airport into the state television microphones. &quot;The Egyptians will not be misled&quot;.
Misleading - according to the President, that is what the other man who currently determines what is happening on the streets is trying to do. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, evading the reach of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to set foot on Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old actor was only known to a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country&#39;s cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: With his YouTube channel &quot;Mohamed&#39;s Secrets,&quot; Ali calls on his compatriots to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president is wallowing in luxury and having magnificent new palaces built, it says. Ali accuses the army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these very gentlemen in his second job as a building contractor for 15 years, he seems to know pretty well what he&#39;s talking about - at least that&#39;s the impression many Egyptians have, as the exploding number of clicks shows.
After thousands of people demonstrated against his rule last week for the first time since Sisi took power and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a &quot;million march&quot; for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would dare to take to the streets. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the town of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests in which participants accused al-Sisi of corruption and called for his departure. During these protests, police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. Initially, these videos could not be independently verified. Security sources said the police had ended the protests.
A heavy police presence was reported on Friday in the Nile Delta city of Mansura, where demonstrators tore up banners bearing the president&#39;s portrait last week. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on arterial roads. In Cairo, several downtown subway stations have been closed for &quot;maintenance work,&quot; and most roads around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, have been blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the toppled Muslim Brotherhood Morsi holed up in 2013 until the army fired on them and killed up to 800 people, another measure was intended to prevent dissatisfied people from gathering: Sisi&#39;s future party wanted a major rally here of all places hold for the President.
These precautions prompted Mohamed Ali to change his tactics: &quot;Our goal doesn&#39;t have to be Tahrir Square,&quot; Ali said into his video camera in Barcelona. &quot;Let&#39;s not clash with police officers&quot;. But that shouldn&#39;t be understood as a retreat: &quot;The whole of Egypt is Tahrir Square.&quot;
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the speed information provided by the provider. In the event of anomalies, customers can check for themselves how much of this has actually been achieved.
After all, the transmission rates promised in advance are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian consumer advice center.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options. The measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
&quot;However, the provider tests are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively,&quot; the Bavarian consumer advice center points out.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to provide the promised service. The best way to do this is in writing by registered mail.
If this does not work even after repeated requests, customers can cancel and possibly also claim damages. But if there is no success, the only way to go is to take legal action.
First senior Republican for inquiry
Vermont&#39;s governor became the first senior Republican to open an impeachment investigation into US President Donald Trump. &quot;I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established,&quot; Phil Scott said at a news conference Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken - impeachment proceedings can lead to the president&#39;s dismissal.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call to investigate interventions in Ukraine by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. Because Trump has been watching Biden “for years”.
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed unease about it. Scott&#39;s statements are a first sign of this in Trump&#39;s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump&#39;s policies, such as relaxing environmental regulations and tightening immigration rules.
Spider-Man Stays in MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the &quot;Avengers&quot; universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: After &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot;, Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several US media unanimously. According to this, the theatrical release should already be certain: In the USA, the film should start on July 16, 2021.
Marvel boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying in Screenrant magazine: &quot;I&#39;m delighted that Spidey&#39;s path is continuing in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are extremely excited that we can continue to work on it... He&#39;s the one only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on its Spidey-verse. You never know what the future will bring.&quot;
But how did the sudden good news come about? Sony is said to have made an offer to Marvel. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also owns Marvel, would take a 30 percent share of the income from upcoming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the &quot;Suits&quot; finale
After nine seasons, the series &quot;Suits&quot; has now reached the grand finale in the USA. There were many happy endings in the last episode and just as many cameo appearances. And the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, were also paid tribute in a charming way. Warning, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
First of all: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a last farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some throwbacks once again showed the most memorable scenes with today&#39;s Duchess. For example the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she greets him after he has served his sentence.
But her real-life husband, Prince Harry, was also casually mentioned in the &quot;Suits&quot; finale, in a wedding scene, of course. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks down the aisle to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark about his suit. The bewildered Harvey wants to know from the groom whether he has actually put on a frock coat, only to then remark snippy: &quot;Louis, you&#39;re not the Prince of England&quot;.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned when a refugee boat capsized in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the accident, the Greek coast guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and mainland Turkey. Four children, three women and five men were saved.
Hundreds of migrants are currently crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 174 people died on this route last year. Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he intends to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to &quot;inform himself in Turkey about the status of the refugee situation,&quot; said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards he wants to learn more about the &quot;administrative problems of the Greeks&quot; in Athens, so that he can help to solve them.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday Seehofer&#39;s planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France&#39;s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
An unusually large number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive in Greece. On Tuesday alone, 654 people crossed over to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Citizen Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally come to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
However, the processing of asylum applications is progressing only with difficulty due to a lack of staff on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Citizen Protection, almost 29,400 people are waiting on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The situation on Lesvos is worst: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
The state broadcaster reported that there had never been so many since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical experts, climate change will put the healthcare system to the test in the future. The climate changes are &quot;definitely&quot; one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. The cardiovascular system in particular was affected by high temperatures and large jumps in temperature within a short period of time, leading to an increased number of heart attacks. Above all, people with cardiovascular diseases, the elderly and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to answer for an embarrassing photo glitch
The leader of the Canadian Green Party, Elizabeth May, during the election campaign - was the cup tampered with for this reason?
The Canadian leader of the Greens holds a reusable cup in one photo. But now it came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally got noticed. Canadian Green Party leader Elizabeth May has never held the reusable coffee mug with a metal straw in her hand. On the party&#39;s website, she was photographed with this mug, talking to citizens. However, the photo had previously been published and also distributed to the media - and the cup was still a plain (cardboard) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green boss has to answer for a photo glitch
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news in order to appear more credible on the topic of &quot;environmental protection&quot;. And that in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which Trudeau is also having an increasingly difficult time because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media, fueling discussion about fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: &quot;The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup&quot;.
May was shocked and claimed on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, with a cup in her hand. However, she corrected it, it was made of bamboo. You always have him with you. A spokeswoman for the party said it was just a matter of putting the party logo in the picture and not covering anything up. Only a section of the photo can be seen on the website.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did this. &quot;I don&#39;t want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide,&quot; she told the Guardian, while at the same time asking her over-dedicated team: &quot;If they want to edit a picture again, they couldn&#39;t do anything with it make my face look younger?&quot;
The German Greens also got into shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. The head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with a plastic spoon on vacation, as reported by merkur.de*.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifetime flight ban at Cathay
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng was promised an upgrade by email from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Getting an upgrade to Business Class on the spur of the moment - that&#39;s what many passengers dream of. Sometimes they are lucky and the check-in staff will offer a free transfer from Economy Class.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. More than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng on Instagram. She flew from Taiwan to New York on May 30th and back on June 7th.
On the outward flight, the staff refused Jaqueline an upgrade, even though she had shown an email in which Cathay Pacific allegedly offered her the prospect of an upgrade. The influencer claims to have received the letter from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of forging the email.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman is said to have shown the same email, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they checked with the head office. And in fact, the employee who allegedly sent the email denied having email contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
Airline officials at the airport canceled Jaqueline&#39;s ticket and issued a lifetime flight ban on Cathay Pacific. She had to buy a new plane ticket to Taiwan for 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros).
The influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, with her case. Because Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed back the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: the influencer committed fraud for Cathay, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline&#39;s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline doesn&#39;t want to be satisfied with that - and is now hiring a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after Yemen ceasefire report
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in a very short space of time on Friday afternoon. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea Brent cost 61.83 US dollars - around 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) variety fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger for the price slide was a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia in mid-September brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill. The Houthi rebels, allied with Iran in civil war Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Like the US government, Saudi Arabia blames Iran. A ceasefire would defuse political tension in the region.
If an agreement is reached, the focus can be on growth and demand concerns, Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, told Bloomberg.
Oil prices are continuing their downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil cost almost $59 and Brent almost $65.
Recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September is progressing faster than expected. Accordingly, the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders who report rapid progress being made by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there were some signs of easing in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker &quot;Stena Impero&quot; is on its way to leave the port more than two months after being seized by Iran and the recent release. The crew is now preparing for departure while the ship is still at anchor, shipping company boss Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS.
However, the United States announced that it would transfer missiles and soldiers to Iran&#39;s archenemy in Saudi Arabia. Fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the USA and Great Britain had at times pushed up oil prices significantly in the past few weeks.
Allegations against Trump are intensifying
In the affair of a possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of a cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several top government officials have made intensive efforts to prevent access to the text of the conversation after a contentious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of &quot;covering up&quot;. Trump spoke of a &quot;witch hunt&quot;.
North Korea doubts third Trump-Kim summit
North Korea has expressed doubts that there will soon be a third summit between ruler Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The purpose and chances of success of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements from the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The US has so far done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean foreign ministry. He also criticized tightened US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. But he hopes for a &quot;wise&quot; and &quot;courageous&quot; decision by Trump so that there can be a rapprochement again.
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim would bring before agreeing to it. Negotiations on disarming North Korea&#39;s nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi in February. In June, the two then met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the consultations, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help with mine clearance
Wearing a blue flak jacket, British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. He set up the ignition circuit near a camp run by the British Halo Trust near Dirico. The explosive device detonated at a safe distance. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later demanded in front of the TV cameras: &quot;I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who did not help to clear them up, to pledge to help &quot;.
Pound under pressure - rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
The pound is depreciating against the euro in the face of an imminent interest rate cut.
Frankfurt Speculations that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon cut interest rates are weighing on the pound sterling. The British currency fell by up to 0.4 percent to $ 1.2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders. He brought up a rate cut, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista said the statement came as a surprise given that Saunders is seen as an advocate of tight monetary policy.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the strains on the economy caused by the Brexit hiccup without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU on October 31 if necessary, even without a divorce agreement.
More: The British Prime Minister took a high risk with his provocations. But it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More proven Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today&#39;s head of integrity at the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia came to light - and they destroyed the little credibility that Russian sport had regained at the beginning of the year and only to a limited extent. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the requested samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic cheating in Russian sport was revealed. Wada then blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage. After individual assessment, the International Olympic Committee allowed around 270 Russian athletes to compete under a neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, and 168 Russian athletes competed at the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to take part in the World Cups in various sports, and in the summer the soccer World Cup took place in Russia with the host as a participant.
There are no positive findings
The following September, Wada lifted the Rusada ban but demanded access to the laboratory and said samples. The data should provide information about the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. They were finally delivered three months later.
The chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory have been manipulated. &quot;Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data,&quot; said David Howman in an interview with the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; on Friday. &quot;We found numerous discrepancies between the data Wada received from a whistleblower and the data it received from the Russians in January.&quot; Many of the positive findings mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The athletics federation is the only organization that adheres to the ban on Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train and undergo tests outside the Russian system.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already alleged manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatened with another ban on Rusada and, in the worst case, exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
