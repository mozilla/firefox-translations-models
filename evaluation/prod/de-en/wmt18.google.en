Munich 1856: Four maps that will change the way you see the city
An insane asylum where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Allotment gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich reveals exciting stories.
It&#39;s annoying when maps aren&#39;t up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass knows this.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, offered by the state government&#39;s Geoportal Bayern, are anything but up-to-date - but that&#39;s why they are very informative.
Especially when you compare them to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the distribution area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork quilt that is not immediately recognizable as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and communities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army commander occupied Bavaria from the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was today&#39;s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV Joseph pushed the project further, founded the &quot;Topographic Bureau&quot; - and with it the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and, like all the others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison of the past and present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today&#39;s Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: when you zoom in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered parcels of land from the so-called &quot;original recording&quot;, from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots of land are no longer occupied by farmers - but allotment gardeners of the &quot;Land in Sonne&quot; complex.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads in the area of today&#39;s district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name &quot;am Gasteig&quot; or from the hill &quot;Auf der Lüften&quot; - but also in large letters &quot;Irren Anstalt&quot;.
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people with delusions were once locked up.
The Munich district insane asylum &quot;Auf der Auer Lüften&quot; was established there in 1858/59.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
&quot;He was progressive for his time and stopped chaining the so-called insane, for example.
He also prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates,&quot; says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Haidhausen Museum, who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition.
There was initially space for 280 patients, but this was later expanded to accommodate 500 patients.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district insane asylum in Haar in 1905.
The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
On the site of the former Auer institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth center with training facilities.
To the west is the soccer field of TSV München Ost, to the east are residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children&#39;s house &quot;Casa Don Bosco&quot; was built - in an architectural style based on the original building of the insane asylum, which was destroyed in bombing raids in the Second World War.
Marienplatz was listed as &quot;Haupt Platz&quot; around 1856, Kaufingerstrasse was called &quot;Kaufinger Gasse&quot;.
The Second World War also brought decisive changes in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, Allied bombs tore many holes in the city center.
A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second main S-Bahn line are taking place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today&#39;s aerial photo - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state&#39;s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
&quot;The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, scheduled to take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to exercise extra caution and caution when traveling through the state, as a A number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred across the state and are noted here,&quot; the group&#39;s statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state&#39;s law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel advisory, the NAACP said.
&quot;You have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They get stopped because of the color of their skin, they get beat up or they get killed,&quot; Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
&quot;We&#39;re hearing complaints at a rate we&#39;ve never heard before.&quot;
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents including racial abuse against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black Tennessee man.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and being taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General&#39;s office showing that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
&quot;The recommendation is that people be aware and let their families, friends and associates know what could be happening in Missouri,&quot; Chapel said.
&quot;People have to be ready, whether it&#39;s bringing bail money or letting relatives know they&#39;re traveling across the state.&quot;
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI&#39;s Hate Crime Reporting Program, which ranks the state 16th in the country for the number of such violations.
The travel advisory is also in response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel advisories are typically issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently advocacy groups have deployed the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
Electric fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.
The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got an idea on site.
At the Rechtgrabenhof belonging to the Schwendemann family, representatives of the local CDU association in Fischerbach met Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann first gave an insight into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, takes care of 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
According to Schwendemann, &quot;Schwarzwaldmilch&quot; is the only marketing channel for the milk from his cows that has no alternative.
Only regional dishes are put on the holiday guests&#39; table.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as &quot;fundamentally important&quot;.
I can&#39;t farm profitably on such steep terrain.
The grassland area causes a lot of work, a lot has to be processed with a brushcutter.
&quot;We&#39;re struggling here with the conditions and the topography,&quot; stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over his parents&#39; business and manages it without chemical pesticides or fertilizers, even if he doesn&#39;t run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: &quot;The municipality has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the Leader funding&quot;.
With costs of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could be dragged out for quite a while.
&quot;The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business,&quot; emphasized the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for the funding
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced in by eleven participants using the electric fence promotion.
The open area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of 71,500 euros was funded by Leader, and a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
This left the farmers with EUR 12,610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
&quot;The big advantage is the longevity of the fences,&quot; explained Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: &quot;You&#39;re doing a really good job, it doesn&#39;t work without farmers and rural women&quot;.
Peter Weiß was also certain: &quot;The best food is produced here&quot;.
The landscape maintenance guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state subsidies for pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced in must not be farmable with a tractor (slope gradient over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach pasture fence project 2018, eight participants with 24 plots are currently applying, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the Trump White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans value it as much as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad&#39;s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime&#39;s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a token ax to the Statue of Liberty amid a heated argument with CNN&#39;s Jim Acosta over the president&#39;s proposals to drastically curb legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked its meaning, and particularly the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument&#39;s completion.
As Miller berated Acosta, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American liberty that lights up the world.
The poem you are referring to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.&quot;
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it&#39;s not really about history.
It&#39;s about the contemporary resonance of the rousing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: &quot;Your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely / the wretched refuse of your rich shores.&quot;
There has never been a time when the &quot;miserable waste&quot; on our screens has been more visible.
Miller didn&#39;t engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump&#39;s United States.
This conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who worked to get her words out on the grassroots after her death - knew very well that they were performing a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of liberty in a worn classic pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has been given a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The pairing of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating assault on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing people have long wanted to change it back.
Big shouter Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is inviting no one but rather an early neocon bringing the American flame to the bedraggled world: &quot;Lady Liberty is leading.
She is to carry the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not intended to light the way to the United States.&quot;
Quite unusually, Limbaugh stumbled upon something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of perspective.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen on the decks of ships by the weary, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys.
It&#39;s literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking sanctuary and a chance to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And that, of course, isn&#39;t the perspective Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Her torch is not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is her only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots on the Great Britain team
UK Athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad &quot;will be a massive contribution to the team&quot;.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that &quot;something special is developing in Scotland&quot; and that UK athletics needs to learn something from it.
&quot;We welcome it, and we&#39;re trying to understand it, and we&#39;re going to keep it going until we find out,&quot; Black said.
&quot;I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it&#39;s absolutely brilliant.&quot;
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, whilst Eilidh Doyle has been chosen by the squad to be team captain.
&quot;Eilidh is quite humble.
Your captain&#39;s speech was incredible,&quot; says Black.
&quot;A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room feeling very proud and very motivated.
The passion and genuine emotion that Eilidh naturally brought was amazing.&quot;
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m at her fifth World Championships, says it is &quot;incredible&quot; that there are 16 Scots on the British team.
Scotland&#39;s best ever total of athletes at the World Cup was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will compete in the 1,500m and 5,000m races.
Chris O&#39;Hare, who runs the 1,500m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers their first World Championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is &quot;enormously proud&quot; of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but will also, in some cases, be involved in the medals and finals.
&quot;What&#39;s special about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me is empowering made it very special to me,&quot; she added.
&quot;Obviously I&#39;m very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we&#39;ve come.
And they&#39;re here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I was just pointing out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it&#39;s really important to bet on that home support and take advantage of being back at the Olympiastadion.
I&#39;m getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it&#39;s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.&quot;
Blocking Critics via Facebook: Don&#39;t run for public office if you can&#39;t stand voter-bashing
The father of our country knew about bad press.
Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn&#39;t long before the newspapers slammed him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the criticism, sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: &quot;Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we shall be led like sheep to the slaughter.&quot;
This brings me to Maryland to see Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan&#39;s staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him over it earlier this week.
The governor&#39;s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was rife with a &quot;So what?&quot; backlash. .
&quot;It&#39;s just Facebook,&quot; many people said.
But it&#39;s important.
And it&#39;s especially important when it&#39;s a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state who is amazingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation&#39;s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in running his state and strict adherence to principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents and easily debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people from coming to the governor&#39;s side — which is a public forum pretended to be official and employees paid in public tax dollars — is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan&#39;s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor&#39;s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it&#39;s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people wielding the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people speaking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a minister, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The minister quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan&#39;s Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md. was not hateful, but did ask about hate crimes.
&quot;I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other breaking news,&quot; she wrote in the comments section of The Post news show.
&quot;I don&#39;t like that idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue then some tend to disregard it as a so-called collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens.&quot;
What the governor&#39;s staff called a &quot;concentrated spam attack&quot; others would likely call &quot;advocacy.&quot;
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It&#39;s a lot cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing, dispatched staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
But that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening digitally right now.
Hogan isn&#39;t the first public official to be criticized for berating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn&#39;t be that difficult.
In Washington&#39;s time, the era of affordable postage had a similar impact to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers lashed out at its leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people using pseudonyms like &quot;Juricola,&quot; &quot;Valerius,&quot; &quot;Belisarius,&quot; and &quot;Portius&quot; all wrote letters to newspapers beating down Washington&#39;s decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project&#39;s Online Papers.
But he didn&#39;t shut her up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are fundamental to our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led to the finals next door at Archerfield Links last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and is acting as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
&quot;I saw the Renaissance Club being built and we see it achieve its glory with this event,&quot; said Rafferty.
&quot;The players will see this course at its best, it&#39;s in great shape.
Jerry did a great job pinpointing this location.
He is a keen supporter of this game and proud of his achievement here.
This is a great showcase for this course.&quot;
England&#39;s Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
&quot;It feels really special,&quot; said the Southport-based player.
&quot;I wasn&#39;t able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was withdrawn from the program the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a truly special time and one we will always cherish.&quot;
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
&quot;It always means a little bit more when you play at home,&quot; said Orr, the Helensburgh man.
&quot;You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I played some solid golf.
I&#39;m happy with how it turned out.&quot;
Joining the trio on the field are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, parking is £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Passive smoking reduces lung cancer deaths
In the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoking.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
&quot;According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year can be attributed to passive smoking,&quot; said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Strasse is in full swing and &quot;is reasonably in time&quot;, according to the head of the building yard, Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, since there is a lot hidden underground that is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, poses a major problem for the Stumpp construction team.
&quot;The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barriers is enormous,&quot; reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
&quot;The hot days were pretty exhausting.
But luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,&quot; says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn&#39;t use a stove.
In fact, she rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - known locally as a &quot;nota&quot; - right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the dirt floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. B. washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
&quot;Nobody dares walk around the village after 5 p.m.,&quot; she says.
It&#39;s a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, recorded in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when just 1,026 elders were to vote by public census before occupying forces.
An existing pro-independence movement against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and bars foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated iron roofs that have been rusted to various hues of tawny.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
&quot;We weren&#39;t used to wearing those clothes,&quot; Degei says, hinting at her vibrant, handwoven turban, dark shirt, and light-colored skirt.
&quot;We used to only have leaves on our bodies.&quot;
Papua is Indonesia&#39;s poorest province, where 28% of the people live below the poverty line and has some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia&#39;s gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized upland province with a population of 153,000.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources valued at an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring Indonesia&#39;s powerful military maintains a stifling presence.
A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are being treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua&#39;s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
&quot;We Will Lose Everything,&quot; says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, including unlawful executions and torture - rape and electrocution being particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
&quot;It&#39;s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,&quot; said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua&#39;s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province&#39;s population of 3.5 million is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up here.
&quot;Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than local Papuans,&quot; explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
&quot;It has cost the native Papuans — the mama-mama [the women] of Papua — their market.&quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua&#39;s 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
&quot;Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored,&quot; You says.
In fact, Paniai hit rock bottom just two months after Jokowi&#39;s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers burst through the darkness on a motorbike.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and hit the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Government Commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - walking in circles and imitating a bird song - by Papua&#39;s Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the atmosphere heated up, an order was sent to the soldiers over an internal radio: &quot;If the masses resist more than three times, shoot them dead,&quot; according to an official TIME document, which has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali&#39;s Kego Koto district, saw the looming danger and called for calm, urging the crowd to return home.
Nobody was in the mood to listen.
&quot;As I turned around, I suddenly got shot in my left wrist,&quot; he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who fired, but says the bullet came from among the soldiers gathered here.
&quot;It was crowded, many shots were fired,&quot; he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.
&quot;I ran to him and checked his body to make sure it was him,&quot; said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, told TIME in a somber mood.
&quot;I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.&quot;
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to &quot;secure&quot; their station because it was under attack.
&quot;We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,&quot; Papuan police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
&quot;It&#39;s about life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others injured.
News of the killings was filtered to Jakarta the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the victims&#39; families and vowing to address historical grievances in Papua.
&quot;I want this case to be solved immediately so that it doesn&#39;t happen again in the future,&quot; he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
&quot;Most of the injuries happened a long time ago.
Some were in the 90&#39;s and early 2000&#39;s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed,&quot; he said.
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a grievance mechanism in Papua.
Instead, &quot;everything will be regulated by law,&quot; he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has indicted for &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; that left more than 1,000 dead in East Timor&#39;s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims met such claims with grim disbelief.
&quot;I&#39;ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there hasn&#39;t been any progress,&quot; says Yohanes.
&quot;I am tired.&quot;
He says years later he still lives in fear.
&quot;I&#39;m scared,&quot; he says.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot.&quot;
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
&quot;After I buried the bodies, the military came looking for me,&quot; he says.
The shootings haven&#39;t stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai&#39;s Deiyai neighborhood.
One person died and 17 others were injured, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company, which refused to take an unconscious man to hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company&#39;s on-site office.
Police said villagers threw stones at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one.
&quot;We were so panicked, we&#39;re afraid there will be revenge,&quot; said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
&quot;I hid in my house for two days.&quot;
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the dissatisfaction of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribesmen living in Papua&#39;s verdant highlands.
Many have joined the Free Papuan Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to be defending Papuans&#39; rights by instigating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years under the pretense of &quot;securing national sovereignty&quot;.
Some never show up again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as &quot;a tragic, forgotten place&quot;.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
What little rice is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruits and leafy greens.
Farming is the job of the women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have grown between native Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since new flight routes to Nabire Airport opened.
The few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or skills to run their own businesses competitively.
&quot;The young people are not interested in staying in the village...because there are no jobs or money here,&quot; says John Gobai, head of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the world&#39;s eyes off Papua.
In addition, international media coverage restrictions remain strained.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi&#39;s campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not materialized.
&quot;There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to cover Indonesia&#39;s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting,&quot; he said in a statement.
A lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua&#39;s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot;various and widespread violations&quot; in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group&#39;s allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: &quot;Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases.&quot;
Local people want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and harassed him &quot;We want freedom,&quot; according to a source who attended the meeting but wish to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
&quot;Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shooting,&quot; said Gobai, the head of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under constant threat from a predatory military, find themselves in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote for Jokowi as a &quot;debt&quot; that he must repay.
&quot;They don&#39;t need money, they just want justice,&quot; he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims performed a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of one victim was buried at a compound just opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don&#39;t let those responsible forget their crimes.
&quot;A member of our family was killed,&quot; says Yacobus, head bowed.
&quot;What else can we do?&quot;
Fires engulf Dubai&#39;s &#39;Torch&#39; skyscraper for the second time
A fire raged at one of the world&#39;s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter, 79-story building.
It&#39;s the second fire to sweep through what happens to be the Torch Tower in just two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and there was no direct word as to the cause of the blaze.
&quot;We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,&quot; a resident, who gave his name as George, told Reuters.
Dubai&#39;s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident may reignite questions about the safety of materials used in exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by management of the Torch building following its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was from the cladding, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the insulation and cladding panel system on London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June that killed around 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Next best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal, which was revolutionary for this sport, to only play Davis Cup singles for two winning sets, was wafer-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-movement classics, which are often very long but are also highly valued for that very reason, are retained in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favor of the reform, the goal of the ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only just missed.
&quot;We respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,&quot; said Haggerty.
We will continue to work on improving the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final at a neutral location had not even come up for voting.
Only comparatively small details are new from 2018: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training grounds etc. will be relaxed and the players will have to attend fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US travelers bring prohibited items on planes, survey finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed items.
Less than 1 percent claimed they belatedly discovered they had inadvertently traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people -- conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. -- also found younger travelers were more likely to flout the rules.
Of those respondents who admitted they had knowingly attempted to fly something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items intentionally smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying bladed objects through security, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally got contraband through airport security and how many did it intentionally.
It&#39;s no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly the most.
However, the company points out that TSA policies are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they can take with them or how much of them.
So it&#39;s no surprise that the largest quantity of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might consider books contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn&#39;t care: tens of thousands of Tesla customers are canceling orders
Electric jack of all trades Elon Musk likes to show off the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla &quot;Model 3&quot;.
So far, he has ignored the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservations.
In addition to the always triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk revealed another, less glamorous number for the first time when the latest quarterly balance sheet was announced: that of the cancellations of the new mass-market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has often advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, which is just starting to be delivered.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will fully refund the €1000 (US$1000 in the US and £1000 in the UK) &quot;reservation deposit&quot;.
Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts that there are currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders to date could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but the production side.
Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles last year.
In 2018 it should be - all models together - 500,000, in 2020 a million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently being added every day.
Anyone ordering a &quot;Model 3&quot; today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to run its brand new, never before tested production lines at maximum capacity without major interruptions.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are longer delays, the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt resigns for delaying Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
A day after being sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental agencies.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It&#39;s about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot;interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma&#39;s Attorney prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly taken action to block or delay regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries oppose.
Wednesday&#39;s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt&#39;s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority in attempting to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his about-face on ozone standards is simply increasing EPA&#39;s willingness to work with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in a timely manner.
&quot;Under previous administrations, the EPA has often missed deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others and come to an agreement to schedule the implementation,&quot; said Pruitt, who has guided the EPA to more than a dozen Mal in his previous job.
&quot;We don&#39;t believe in law enforcement and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us.&quot;
Still, EPA&#39;s statement said that at some point, Pruitt will use its &quot;authority to delay and any other legally available powers&quot; to ensure the rules are &quot;based on sound policy and the best information available.&quot;
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month would delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep the legal pressure going.
&quot;EPA&#39;s reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by smog pouring into their communities,&quot; said Schneiderman.
New York in this case joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is formed when pollutants from automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for vulnerable groups of people, and contributes to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered Pruitt&#39;s surprising change of course.
&quot;It&#39;s disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from those responsible for protecting the air we breathe,&quot; said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
&quot;We must continue to fight the Trump administration&#39;s ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests.&quot;
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the jubilee of the mountain church, a serenade will be held in the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16 at 4:30 p.m.
Due to its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to linger.
The visitors of the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen have made it their concern to save and preserve the oldest building in town.
Walter Martini emphasizes: &quot;It is a unique village gem&quot;.
In 1267, the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold &quot;the mountain with the parish church on it in Tumlingen, including the bailiwick&quot; to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 silver marks.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a manorial farm on the Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, in addition to the lower and upper villages, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the &quot;mountain&quot; was the third, the manorial core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical facts.
The right of patronage arose from early medieval proprietary church law.
A gentleman who built a church, furnished it and staffed it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be surrendered in 1942 during the Second World War.
During the Thirty Years&#39; War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and pews and used them for firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlingen Hilarius Cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year&#39;s Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the dwarf tower that still exists today has been preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the &quot;Schaffigen Rentern&quot; team take care of the Hilarius facility as Dieter Dockhorn&#39;s successors.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16th at the St. Hilarius chapel in the old cemetery.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Hartmut Romann has the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the serenade there will be a drink in front of the cemetery.
&quot;Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest&quot;, the organizers emphasize the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to looking after their homeland, as the serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have the approval of wind turbines checked
&quot;Boisheim defends itself&quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore contacted the district administrator.
The &quot;Boisheim defends itself&quot; association has asked District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in Boisheim&#39;s Nette.
It was done illegally.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at that time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone on the city limits to Schwalmtal.
In principle, the construction and operation of wind turbines is possible within this concentration zone, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being &quot;sparged&quot;.
A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by changing the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved this due to a formal error.
&quot;Due to the lack of a legal planning requirement, the approval notice that was issued is still illegal and therefore has to be withdrawn,&quot; said Christoph Erkens, chairman of &quot;Boisheim defends itself&quot;.
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: &quot;This means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out under planning law&quot;.
The Circle acknowledges receipt of the request.
&quot;The corresponding letters have been received by the Viersen district since last week,&quot; said a spokesman.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to examine the matter again.
However, they are unlikely to lead to the process being stopped.
With a view to the ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argumentation of the association &quot;Boisheim defends itself&quot; on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines, each 200 meters high, on an area on Boisheimer Nette.
The company, in which the city of Viersen has an indirect stake, concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site last year.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity requirements of around 11,400 households should be covered - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all Viersen households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen&#39;s city council gave the go-ahead for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn district).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an escort on the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and dealers plan &quot;home shopping&quot; weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping possibilities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend of September 8th and 9th to lure the residents into the city center for a shopping spree.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the &quot;home shopping&quot; weekend is intended to sensitize customers to what offers their own city has in store apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present their training positions.
In addition, the shops in the city center should invite people to &quot;shopping in the middle of the night&quot;.
The campaign is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
According to Christian König, commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that refer to the campaign weekend are in preparation.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The trade association and the city are thus entering a further stage of the &quot;Attractive inner city&quot; project.
This includes new offers such as the first &quot;Active Day&quot; for the fountain festival, including a Sunday when shops are open, discussions with all tradespeople and innkeepers to encourage them to actively participate.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be newly or again developed.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals also lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - right down to landlords, companies throughout the city and clubs.
It is important to use a network to overcome the lethargy that has spread in some cases, König said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that for the first time five Thuringian cities are taking part in the third nationwide &quot;Home Shopping&quot; day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should &quot;promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities,&quot; said Streich.
The campaign, led by the IHK and with many partners, also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his immediate environment with his purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
A gas explosion occurred in the school building during construction work.
New more people were injured.
A gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis killed two people and injured nine others, some seriously.
According to the fire brigade, one injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the blast.
An initially missing person was later recovered dead.
The dead were school employees.
The authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline to be the cause of the accident.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by the Washington Post.
On Jan. 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena, Trump urged Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall. He reportedly told him, &quot;You can&#39;t tell the press that.&quot;
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the US southern border and vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull that a deal for the US to take on refugees migrating to Australia was &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;lousy&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; and that insisting on the deal being brokered by the Obama administration , would make him look like an &quot;idiot&quot; after proposing a ban on resettling refugees in the US.
Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull &quot;this is the most awkward call of the day.&quot;
Moore&#39;s Ford massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynch act as call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a crowd of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia and rumbled toward Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates hovered in fear.
&quot;We want that n----r Roger!&quot; the man yelled.
&quot;Get him out of the car!&quot;
Screams shattered the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Luckily, that horrifying scene that played out on July 22nd is just a re-enactment.
But then, when a noose is thrown around &quot;Roger&#39;s&quot; neck, almost everyone in the audience let out very genuine sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
&quot;It&#39;s really unbelievable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,&quot; said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping organize the reenactment.
&quot;It&#39;s a smudge on a story, but it&#39;s a burden on our souls.&quot;
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia State Congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that a wrong has never been righted.
&quot;We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice,&quot; he said.
&quot;We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.&quot;
A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But none have ever been charged.
Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations behind the lynchings have always been citywide well-known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black Georgia citizens to vote in the summer primary for the first time.
Around the same time as the election, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed and stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly over a woman, according to the FBI.
Brooks said the rumor around town was that Hester had slept with Malcom&#39;s wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband&#39;s.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to break Malcom out of prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they walked away from the jail and near Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
&quot;As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings,&quot; concludes an FBI report.
&quot;It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the killings, removing evidence and covering up the identities of witnesses.&quot;
Brooks put it even more succinctly.
&quot;It was a suffrage massacre,&quot; he said.
&quot;They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: &#39;If you register and if you vote, this is going to happen to you.&#39;
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene directed the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It&#39;s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that&#39;s the point.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about the lynching because then we&#39;ll be confronted with the ugliness in all of us,&quot; she said.
&quot;But I can&#39;t relate to you if you don&#39;t want to listen to me or what I&#39;ve been through.&quot;
Rehearsals for this year&#39;s production began in June, and on day one nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed outline of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene&#39;s co-director here.
He&#39;s played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
&quot;I feel dirty because I&#39;m not like that,&quot; Marbaugh said.
&quot;But I think it&#39;s very important to keep that story alive because we don&#39;t want to go back to those times.&quot;
Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their lines.
The play begins with Malcom yelling and harassing Hester, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
&quot;I said, n---er, get off my property!&quot;
Rascona returns fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
&quot;What?!&quot; Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
was i too hard
&quot;No,&quot; Greene said, still giggling.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think white people said &#39;n---er&#39; back then.&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; one of the other black cast members quipped.
&quot;You just have to type the hard &#39;R.&#39; meet.&quot;
And that&#39;s where the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replacing the uneasiness.
Everyone is busy trying to get this right, not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four people that were killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunshots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday&#39;s mourning eulogy, &quot;Strange Fruit.&quot;
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred yards behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.
A couple traveled from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia&#39;s oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours as Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the Malcom and Dorsey burial grounds.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels ghostly.
As the last notes of the song play out, Greene invites the crowd to come over and inspect the bodies.
Children perch on their heads, registering the fake blood and still bodies, and whispering to each other.
&quot;You&#39;re not really dead,&quot; a little boy murmurs, as if trying to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it&#39;s over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clanmate.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then collapses in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through.
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; whispers one of the women.
&quot;We know it&#39;s not in your heart.
You did this for a reason.&quot;
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about a re-enactment with a black couple they&#39;ve just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for the feeling the performance left behind.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to hear those horrific words and actions ... coming from people who look like you and who are doing it because they look like you,&quot; she said.
&quot;What this is really doing to me makes me believe the lynching is still going on,&quot; she added, &quot;nowadays it&#39;s just called a police shooting.&quot;
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eats, and commemorates civil rights.
He said he has already started planning next year&#39;s performance.
&quot;The re-enactment is inspiring in a way as it describes the horror of what we endured, but it&#39;s also a learning moment,&quot; he said.
&quot;The thing is, if we don&#39;t learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, are doomed to repeat it.&quot;
&quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner&#39;s monumental work, director Frank Castorf also relies on a colourful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the remains of the Wall and a kebab shop in Berlin, a &quot;Plaste und Elaste&quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Parked in front of it is an open vintage Mercedes, in which the Rhinemaidens pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf&#39;s leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through his &quot;Ring&quot; production.
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully, as they did in &quot;Rheingold&quot;.
They kessily seduce Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood style and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, who has the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
The scene when he kills Siegfried is brutal.
Later Gunther (Markus Eiche) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who bows modestly and forms his hands in the Merkel rhombus, are enthusiastically celebrated.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which appears on stage for the first time - again in casual leisure clothing in view of the great heat.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors had been eagerly awaited.
In 2013 he had to endure a shrill whistle concert, but five years later there was great jubilation, in which the occasional &quot;boo&quot; was lost.
Festival director Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it.
&quot;You can tell that the audience has grown together with the &quot;Ring&quot; in a certain way,&quot; she told dpa shortly before the performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also gained an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
You will work in several places during your volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have already worked at the school in the open full-time.
How is your experience with it?
Crowd: It&#39;s a nice, broad spectrum I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-call volunteer.
how come
Crowd: I graduated from high school.
And then, let&#39;s say, successfully completed a degree in civil engineering.
I&#39;ve realized that it&#39;s the wrong thing for me and that I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Do a social year, you get an insight, you can see what it&#39;s really like on site, perhaps in the focal point.
And was it?
Crowd: I got great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I&#39;m going to study dual, I&#39;m probably doing social work training at the youth welfare office in Herne and I&#39;m studying at the University of Applied Sciences in Hamm.
Isn&#39;t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from a retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what appealed to me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Different from studying civil engineering?
Menge: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in mind, each with a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren&#39;t afraid of contact?
Crowd: I&#39;m not the type for that.
It&#39;s an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that&#39;s life.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting the dividend to revive the business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut a further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as it launches another restructuring program to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, which CEO John Fallon announced will mostly take place in late 2018 and early 2019, come on top of his previous restructuring, which already saw 4,000 job losses.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by a further £300m ($394m) in a third cost-cutting program to revitalize a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the financial year was unchanged after posting a 1 percent increase to £2.05 billion in the first half.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and one interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - killing more than 30 people at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
A NATO statement said the blast happened Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot;person-carried improvised explosive device.&quot;
The statement says all of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombardment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the country&#39;s deadliest militant attack since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs increasing the number of US troops supporting the country&#39;s military and police forces.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis in public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghani&#39;s reputation.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision by the Obama administration to delay regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions. This comes a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to move forward with what it calls the &quot;2015 ozone regulations,&quot; saying it shows the agency&#39;s commitment to working with states.
&quot;We believe in engaging with and responding to our government partners,&quot; EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA&#39;s intention to extend ozone regulations - which will measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - by a year, to October 2018 to delay.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda Trump said is designed to boost economic growth.
But the effort has sparked backlash from Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the public health impact of larger emissions.
The EPA&#39;s website says that breathing air containing ozone &quot;can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms&quot; such as asthma.
City council wants common room
In the end, the decision was clear: with two dissenting votes, the Fluorn-Winzeln municipal council decided to set up a community room in the future senior citizens&#39; residential complex.
Before the discussion, there is one important piece of information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
It will be a while before the area previously owned by the church community is owned by the community, but there are no longer any planning obstacles for the project, which is to be managed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common room for that.
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to accommodate the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council have in mind that such a common room should not only be a meeting place for the residents of senior-friendly housing, but open to the community.
As an example, the word &quot;knitting café&quot; made the rounds.
The decision, which was made in advance by providing funds for the current budget last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in the redevelopment area.
According to Tjaden, setting up a community room would be eligible for funding at 60 percent out of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that one does not want to throw a spanner in the works in this respect, the proposed resolution provides for the statement that both a gabled roof - which is based on the surrounding buildings - and a pent roof - which reduces the eaves height and the Construction more economical power - would be possible.
Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks that this addition is unnecessary.
If it helps: it passes the board unanimously.
It&#39;s not that easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you don&#39;t really make much progress, but now you lean out of the window in the common room, she says: &quot;I&#39;m having a hard time with it&quot;.
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favor of the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation.
She sees behind this a hidden subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
That is not the case, because the purchase of the area does not give you a subsidy, but you get a real value that can be marketed in case of doubt, is the counter-argument.
Staiger&#39;s motion to split the proposed resolution accordingly has three supporters.
With two dissenting votes, the original program remains, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: &quot;If we make the decision like this, we will take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure&quot;.
Collision with a car: cyclists are thrown onto the road
An 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car while crossing the street in Garath on Wednesday and was seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on his bike at 12.20 p.m. on the Schwarzer Weg cycle path coming from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When Langenfelder drove onto the street, he apparently didn&#39;t pay attention to oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old woman from Hilden.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich has to do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to skip the game against Dortmund.
FC Bayern is traveling to Dortmund for the first competitive game of the new season with personnel concerns.
The defending champion in the Supercup is missing seven professionals against the cup winner.
The personnel worries at the German soccer record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (8.30 p.m. / ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in the duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, Munich&#39;s Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team&#39;s game for the five defeats in the last six friendlies.
&quot;We know that we are not in the best physical condition,&quot; said Ancelotti, adding: &quot;The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn&#39;t good in the end.&quot;
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official competitive game of the season.
&quot;Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently,&quot; said Ancelotti, who expects a &quot;difficult, intense game&quot;.
The duel between the two German football heavyweights casts a spell over the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hike from star to star in the Harz mountains
Germany&#39;s first &quot;Star Path&quot; is to be created in the Harz Mountains.
This is planned by the Sankt Andreasberg observatory association.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A &quot;star path&quot; meets the information needs of many Harz visitors, it said.
He combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up boards along the planned route and provide information about the stars and constellations.
In a first phase up to 2018, the association is planning &quot;easily accessible installations at five to six locations&quot; in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber could be considered.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, good mobile network reception plays a role when choosing a location.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be expanded step by step.
&quot;On the Star Trail, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars,&quot; the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another even though it is much further away.
It is also conveyed in which constellation a selected star is located and when it can best be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be clearly seen with the naked eye.
In the university town there has been something similar to the planned star trail since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen - the planet trail.
Beginning in front of Gebhard&#39;s hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; location in Diemarden (community of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto at the end point, which has been demoted to a dwarf planet - are set up exactly at a distance and on a scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere with a diameter of 6.5 millimeters, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the Planet Trail is a good four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are therefore faster than light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most thrilling under-147-pound boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Featherweight Champion.
Following Garcia&#39;s victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, &quot;How are you, champion?
I wish you luck.&quot;
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas remarked that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the &quot;perfect scale&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m a former featherweight,&quot; Garcia recalled.
&quot;I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds] but I&#39;m not that tall.
I&#39;m small for 140.
I want to go down to lightweight.
And he has to move to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That&#39;s what the fans want.
Let&#39;s give them that.&quot;
Lomachenko agreed.
&quot;Boxing needs this fight.&quot;
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy Lomachenko, with a 135-pound debut, will have to fight this year to set a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts ) who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on September 23rd.
&quot;This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking for it,&quot; Garcia said, later opening up about fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can garner that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready...&quot;
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is &quot;a tremendous fighter&quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko lingered on the generous praise for Garcia, saying he thought the Riverside three-way champion looked &quot;very slow, sorry Mikey... you wanted the knockout.&quot;
Garcia said the focus is showing punching power, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building for their own fight.
&quot;This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and excitement.
I&#39;m more than happy to be working on it,&quot; Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for the top fighters and this is Mikey.
It&#39;s going to be a great fight.&quot;
Four injured after tire blowout
Four people were injured, some seriously, in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle around 4:30 p.m. shortly before the Marktbreit junction, probably after a tire burst.
The car spun to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then landed on its roof in the grass verge.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were injured in the accident, some seriously.
While the rescue service was providing first aid to the injured, the A7 northbound was closed for about an hour, after which traffic on the left lane was diverted past the scene of the accident.
Fortunas Hoffmann: &quot;Back three works better&quot;
After the 2-2 win against Braunschweig at the start of the season, Andre Hoffmann hopes that optimizing the defensive formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and also with the result, if it hadn&#39;t been for the two goals conceded in the 2-2 win against Braunschweig.
&quot;That was two goals too many and we have to be even more careful in Aue,&quot; said the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Ore Mountains, the chain of three should also be further optimized.
And the Fortunes don&#39;t want to catch a goal after a free kick anymore.
&quot;For the future it will be the case that no one stands next to Michael (Rensing) on the line.&quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get along better with the back three than with the back four, even after the experience gained in preparation.
&quot;I still don&#39;t know how we will act in Aue,&quot; says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of himself, &quot;because we have players in the back three in the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well &#39; said Hoffman.
&quot;The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we don&#39;t allow so many playing errors in the structure.&quot;
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
&quot;But I don&#39;t know whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw.
The performance could be okay,&quot; said Hoffmann.
&quot;But if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, then we can definitely say that the season has started well.&quot;
His coach didn&#39;t want to know anything about that.
&quot;I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days,&quot; said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn&#39;t want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the Saxons&#39; game in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely due to a storm.
&quot;Now they can basically start the season with a home game,&quot; said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue could perhaps even be a little fresher, since they didn&#39;t have a difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in their bones.
&quot;But they don&#39;t know 100 percent where they stand at the moment,&quot; says Fortuna&#39;s central defender.
The guests from the Rhineland go into the match in the finally (almost) finished stadium in Aue as the slight favorites on Sunday.
&quot;The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the right to finish in the top six is nonsense,&quot; says Funkel, whose record of just one defeat against Aue in nine games is quite positive.
&quot;There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start,&quot; explains Fortuna&#39;s head coach.
&quot;To make such a statement would be arrogant and presumptuous&quot;.
And that&#39;s not how Funkel wants to see his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who underwent a new method of medically assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Board of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
They are said to make age assessments more accurate during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to assess the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot;possibly 18 years of age or older&quot;.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person &quot;may be under the age of 18&quot;.
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person&#39;s age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
&quot;We don&#39;t see a big difference in the statistics over the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent,&quot; he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that &quot;suggested that the person tested was 18 years of age or older.&quot;
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of those cases the person had openly stated that they would be 18 that year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some quarters.
One skeptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work involves assessing people&#39;s biological maturity to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
&quot;I had reason to think about it and I don&#39;t think that type of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can&#39;t say for sure, then we shouldn&#39;t pretend we can,&quot; he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: &quot;In general you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18, in which case it&#39;s about 10 percent.&quot;
Right on schedule
Work on the three bridges on Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
&quot;We are very well on time, it&#39;s going great,&quot; says Reinhold Leicht, site manager in the Department of Roads and Traffic in the Regional Council of Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach that were in need of renovation.
Construction is scheduled to end in October and Leicht is confident that the schedule will be met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is an arched bridge made of concrete clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it is now showing its age.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges cross the Lauterbach.
They are built of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 meters long respectively.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach received a so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side, which is 1.30 meters wide and weighs seven tons.
This is an edge fortification that is also used as a service path.
A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be installed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is where the pedestrian walkway should go.
The special thing about it is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges already have the patented bridge caps.
Laying the lines through the structure in Lauterbach required a great deal of finesse.
A fiber optic cable also runs there, to which many companies are connected.
In the run-up to the work, the local residents were informed about the project by flyers.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished out first.
For the bridges between the depot building and the collecting pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated to one lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge near the hotels &quot;Tannenhof&quot; and &quot;Sieben Linden&quot; is completely closed.
The costs for the three bridge renovations total 700,000 euros.
The whole thing is funded by the state.
AfD in Gerolstein: colorful protest with German potato salad
It doesn&#39;t happen that often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), things come together that are otherwise difficult to reconcile.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel district council (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that is peacefully flying the flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the &quot;big election campaign start&quot; according to the poster.
And brings well-known names to the starting line - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal elections on September 24th, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are there hours before the event begins don&#39;t want to listen to the AfD members, they want to demonstrate.
The motto &quot;The Eifel stays colourful&quot;.
The city picnic was originally planned under the motto &quot;Everyone at one table&quot; on Brunnenplatz, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that presents itself.
And what makes Christa Karoli, Chairwoman of Forums Eine Welt and one of the main organizers, really happy: &quot;It&#39;s great how many people have come together here&quot;.
There is music and lots of food, including a &quot;original German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,&quot; says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, they are particularly present at the train station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come up with Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he tried to organize such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked in Daun, but was rejected there because there were not enough parking spaces due to the Laurentius fair that had already been set up.
So now the roundabout, Hompes is happy that &quot;we can have such a nice event here&quot;.
Looking at the event on the roundabout, he says: &quot;People have every right, the main thing is that it stays peaceful.&quot;
It does: around 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment on the roundabout in front of the square, and various speakers in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are around 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the federal elections, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence has not changed, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little over an hour, the guests on the forecourt have more staying power, but there too it is time to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone meets trumpet
The Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will be heard again in the Haslach Monastery Concerts series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto &quot;Black Sea meets Black Forest&quot;, or &quot;Balkan folklore&quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass band music.
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist with the SWR Symphonieorchester.
Both are united by the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments, but also to merge the borders of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like it&#39;s in a new guise with the two, Daniel Schnyder&#39;s &quot;World Music&quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece &quot;Exchange Suite&quot; by Jazz Echo Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing are mixed into a fascinating total work of art .
This core part of the program was premiered this spring in Freiburg with great success.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart opens up about her bisexuality
&quot;Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything,&quot; Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
&quot;Once I bite into grilled cheese I&#39;m like, &#39;Oh that was cool, what&#39;s next?&#39;&quot;
Probably the Hollywood star&#39;s most well-known relationship was with her &quot;Twilight&quot; colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately ended bitterly.
Despite all of that, the brunette actress told Harper&#39;s Bazaar magazine, &quot;I&#39;ve been seriously in love with everyone I&#39;ve dated.
Or do you think I played it?&quot;
After their split, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: &quot;I&#39;ve always lived dualism and genuinely believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I&#39;ve just never liked not being taken seriously.&quot;
According to &quot;Bang Showbiz&quot;, she suffered particularly from this when she was at school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: &quot;Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven the kids told me I looked like a boy.
I felt really offended, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and I&#39;m like, &#39;Girl, be proud of yourself!&#39;.&quot;
She doesn&#39;t like to explain her love life to the public in particular: &quot;People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don&#39;t like having to justify myself to the public at large.&quot;
West Virginia&#39;s governor announces he&#39;s changing parties
. West Virginia&#39;s Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would switch parties.
Like it or not, the Democrats have walked away from me,&quot; Gov. Justice said.
&quot;Today I will tell you with much prayer and much thought...today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I cannot help you more once I am a Democratic governor.&quot;
The rally erupted in cheers.
&quot;Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I would say it&#39;s time to play a different game.&quot;
Mr. Trump earlier promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
He&#39;s worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, &quot;Governor Justice&#39;s change of party is another blow to a Democratic party that would hinder rather than work to make our country great again. &quot;
&quot;With only 15 governorates and controlling the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice&#39;s announcement is just the latest rejection from a party left top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message,&quot; RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises &#39;honest&#39; Russian apology for doping scandal
World chief of athletics Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as a blatant apology from Russia over a doping scandal, but he reiterated it is not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.
Russia&#39;s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country&#39;s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he feels sorry for &quot;all the athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched away in competitions.&quot;
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
&quot;I thought it was a very candid response today, a very honest presentation,&quot; IAAF President Coe told reporters.
&quot;The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized within itself that it has been through some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped.&quot;
Coe said he was also &quot;pleased&quot; that Russia was accepting the criteria for his reinstatement.
&quot;I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force&#39;s recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia,&quot; Coe said.
&quot;We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,&quot; he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutrals under the strict IAAF criteria at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
IAAF task force chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still operating freely, he told reporters in London after speaking at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar, north Hesse, around 1,000 people commemorated the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the cause of the crash, which is still unclear.
However, she described the two pilots who died as &quot;experts in their field&quot;.
&quot;We bow to this supreme sacrifice that you have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany,&quot; she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old staff captain from northern Hesse died in West African Mali a week ago on Wednesday.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and, accompanied by a Bundeswehr wake, brought to Fritzlar Cathedral in Sankt Peter on Thursday.
At noon, initially only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
The funeral service then began with family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politicians.
Among them were the Prime Minister of Hesse, Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr, Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
Fritzlar residents and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen in front of the church.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as &quot;highly decorated&quot; and experienced in action.
The staff captain helped set up the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six Tiger pilots in his regiment to receive training.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: &quot;If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one could have.&quot;
Minister von der Leyen showed no doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the mission was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance &quot;for a country from which we are only separated by two states,&quot; she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
The Bundeswehr did not provide any information on when and where they will be buried.
Prince Henrik doesn&#39;t want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband&#39;s decision, the statement said.
It is still unclear where Prince Henrik will be buried.
But he has no intention of being buried in his native France.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to have become king.
In 2016 he retired and also gave up the title of &quot;Prince Consort&quot;.
Since Henrik did not get the title and position he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman for the Danish royal family.
It is still unclear where the 83-year-old&#39;s final resting place will be.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his native France, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the Thames he worked in the French embassy.
While expressions of sympathy from the people always flew towards his later wife, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes during his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first years in Denmark: &quot;A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was shaky, I preferred wine to beer, silk stockings to knitted socks, Citroën to Volvo, tennis to football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had a reputation in this country for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
i was different
I seemed content with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!&quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants quick new elections
CDU and FDP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
After the loss of the red-green government majority, Lower Saxony&#39;s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favor of a quick new election in the state parliament, but he does not want to resign.
Weil spoke out in favor of dissolving parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprising exit of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step by not being nominated for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
&quot;I see my political future in the CDU,&quot; she said in Hanover on Friday.
CDU faction leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his faction to include them.
This means that the CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far the relationship has been the opposite.
The new state parliament will be elected on January 14 next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the state parliament decides to dissolve itself as quickly as possible.
The CDU parliamentary group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility for the state parliament to withdraw its confidence in the prime minister and elect a successor.
&quot;Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be checked legally,&quot; said Thümler.
&quot;All questions will be discussed in peace once they have been properly examined from a legal point of view.&quot;
Thümler called Twesten&#39;s step &quot;a bit strange&quot;.
The politician herself emphasized: &quot;I&#39;m not a traitor.
I feel very good&quot;.
She described herself as a supporter of black and green.
The Greens called on the renegade MP to return her seat in the state parliament.
&quot;Of course, we assume that she will return her seat in the state parliament, which she received via the green state list, with immediate effect,&quot; said state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The parliamentary group leader of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: &quot;We very much regret Elke Twesten&#39;s decision&quot;.
She made a conscious decision not to have a debate in the group.
&quot;Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step.&quot;
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the conversion of the Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
&quot;The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red-Green Party,&quot; wrote the head of the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the state parliament.
Twesten&#39;s exit will cost Red-Green a majority in Lower Saxony.
&quot;In her injured vanity and her frustration, the politician put her personal interests before the welfare of the country,&quot; criticized SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil.
&quot;It&#39;s a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigues and trying to make political capital out of it.&quot;
Lower Saxony&#39;s CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his MPs include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
At that time, the CDU was the strongest force ahead of the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Interview with the Minister of Agriculture - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) answers questions in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a good look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp.
The federal states post the latest information about the batches of eggs affected on the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarning.de.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically impossible.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the range - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the federal states since it became known that Germany was affected.
All information and the risk assessment are available to consumers.
Retailers, like manufacturers, have to ensure that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not marketable.
However, unencumbered eggs can be sold and consumed.
It&#39;s not the farms&#39; fault this time.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly to blame.
Rather, they have to reckon with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it just a lack of staff or also of coherent responsibility?
It was the official controls that uncovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal activity can never be ruled out 100 percent.
For this very reason, consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor&#39;s office in cases in which criminal offenses may have occurred are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a thorough investigation from the responsible authorities.
Is the regular alarmism about food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to only receive safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
The adulterated drug has put manufacturers, retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Basically, it must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be worked on consistently and at full speed at all levels.
I expect all responsible authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely.
How football&#39;s financial rules affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar&#39;s world-record transfer from Spain&#39;s Barcelona to France&#39;s Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences are yet to come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the governing body overseeing European play has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, instituted by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar&#39;s transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona have paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar&#39;s move to France.
PSG can certainly cash in on Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars given the team&#39;s funding from the energy-rich Qatari ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money to acquire players, but must counter this with legitimate revenue streams that allow them to break even in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs&#39; debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant the business model Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - was to become a tougher proposition.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can sustain losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini falling out of favor from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin remains committed to discouraging excessive spending.
&quot;Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules in the future,&quot; Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar&#39;s buyout clause in a lump sum, they can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, meaning that the transfer fee for the next five years can be reported in the financial statements at €44.4m.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG with the heaviest sanctions along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City.
PSG were fined €60m ($82m at the time), which was later reduced to €20m - and ordered that the squad for the 2014/15 Champions League be reduced to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited.
UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that might try to outsmart their financial regulators by inflating their revenue through companies linked to a club&#39;s owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not consider it legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of PSA&#39;s sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of PSG&#39;s payments to Neymar could come via payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more alert to heed any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar&#39;s transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than €10m in 2015/16 with a turnover of €542.4m.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expect Neymar&#39;s arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandise and kit sales.
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 per cent after the signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of football&#39;s best players go and tried to prevent Neymar&#39;s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
&quot;It&#39;s a clear case of &#39;financial doping&#39; with the club and the state,&quot; La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS in regards to Qatar&#39;s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga&#39;s reservations about a state funding a club.
&quot;It&#39;s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years,&quot; Wenger said on Thursday.
&quot;Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can walk different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.&quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is re-tendering the contract.
At the request of the sda news agency, Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report in the newspaper &quot;Nordwestschweiz&quot; on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products are checked and quality controlled every two to three years.
&quot;We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey,&quot; said the spokeswoman.
Every year, flight attendants distribute around 17 million small red and white wrapped chocolate bars weighing 14 grams to passengers before they land.
Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
According to &quot;Northwestern Switzerland&quot;, industry insiders estimate the order volume at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago when it started working with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with delicacies from Confiserie Sprüngli, in Business Class passengers can enjoy chocolates from Lindt and in Economy Class chocolates from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss chocolate from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on short-haul routes, both in Business and Economy Class.
Athletics - Olympic discus champion Robert Harting reaches the World Cup final
The three-time world champion is fighting for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion in 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
The Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, also qualified for the final with the first attempt.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; and &quot;Comrade Detective.&quot;
This iteration of history is at the same time nostalgic for the characters&#39; glory days of the &#39;80s, for the &#39;90s grunge era (when masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter were filming the sketch comedy &#39;The State&#39; for MTV ), and for herself - that is, for 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
&quot;First Day of Camp&quot; worked surprisingly well, and not just for its absurd humor (it featured an original story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the gag&#39;s gist - middle-aged actors play horny kids growing up - they still managed the impossibility of retrieving the last part of the joke.
&quot;Ten Years Later,&quot; with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and more watering-can in its parody, including a riff on &#39;90s stalker movies like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. (&quot;The hand that rocks the cradle&quot;).
At one point, a character is browsing through an Apple PowerBook, some inline skates, and &quot;a bunch of other things from 1991&quot;.
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn&#39;t forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn&#39;t lost his virginity.
And there&#39;s another insanely vicious plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) now backed by George HW Bush (a well-done impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the digressions are the best part of the franchise.
It&#39;s especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing off Matt Dillon&#39;s mustache from &quot;Singles,&quot; whose former big-man-on-camp Andy is now feeling like an old geezer.
It&#39;s the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise, like a sort of repetitive &quot;Seven Up!&quot; series until he reaches what I take to be his logical conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, the final scene of which will show the gang attending the film premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon&#39;s Comrade Detective, meanwhile, evokes a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of The Americans, the movie Atomic Blonde, and even GLOW, with its East vs. West wrestling iconography .
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas claims to be a found TV series: an eighties Romanian drama with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the Fighting the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hardened Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with dialogue dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It&#39;s a brilliant idea.
But it&#39;s not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV like Americans might watch football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.
But &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - involving a killer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays as one.
With six long episodes, it drags on and the comedy isn&#39;t fast enough or frequent enough.
Edited to a shorter length, &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; could do a better job of delivering its agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American Embassy, whose lobby is always manned by two fat men devouring a pile of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make anything fodder for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators weren&#39;t wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and theirs.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Konstanz public prosecutor announced on Friday.
15 suspects between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
The officers also seized large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspected Italians.
The two will therefore probably be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were on duty.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
The public prosecutor&#39;s office in Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany since the summer of 2016.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor&#39;s offices in Constance and Palermo, and the investigators from the Rottweil Criminal Police Office were in almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
The investigations primarily targeted Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian mafia.
The gang can also be blamed for an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning.
Weise bemoans large gaps in the register of foreigners
&quot;Data from citizens that shouldn&#39;t appear there&quot;: According to a report, the foreigners&#39; register in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to &quot;sometimes serious wrong decisions&quot; in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Weise in an analysis available to the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;.
According to the information, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded in the register, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by around 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 was found, &quot;from people who have long since passed away, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register&quot;.
&quot;Incorrect data entry can significantly slow down return processes,&quot; the report continues.
The statistics on people who are obliged to leave the country also include EU citizens who do not have to leave the country at all.
However, such incorrect assignments led to &quot;a distorted debate about how to deal with those who were obliged to leave the country,&quot; according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently started sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy if they entered the country from there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot;.
The paper states that the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures &quot;regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since June 1, 2017&quot;.
Since the end of 2014, this has practically no longer been possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, the EU country that they reach first is responsible for refugees.
If a migrant travels on to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
As a reason, the office now writes: “In the meantime, the capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly”.
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these promises to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic policy spokeswoman for the left-wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: &quot;Due to the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system, families with children are threatened with receiving conditions that violate human rights and endanger the child&#39;s well-being.&quot;
Second best result achieved
The blood donation service has already made a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach available for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First and foremost Jürgen Greule, who has now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood at the municipal council meeting.
&quot;It&#39;s brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the donors who donate their blood to strangers, and we do so unselfishly,&quot; emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
&quot;A single blood donation helps several people,&quot; explained the district head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned goods are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from one blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
&quot;This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors,&quot; said the DRK district preparedness leader.
Apparently, the move to the theater a few years ago led to a higher number of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were each awarded 50 blood donations.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger registered half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave 500 milliliters of their lifeblood ten times.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and moderating inflation dampened speculation of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain &quot;sluggish&quot; as it maintained interest rates on family income amid mounting pressures.
Policymakers at the bank&#39;s Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to hold interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members targeting a hike this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn should.
But she signaled that rate hikes would be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit.
She will call for time for the funding plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from next February, although it has been said it is now expected to provide £15bn more under that scheme - at £115bn.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: &quot;In MPC&#39;s central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the near term as pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh on consumption.&quot;
On interest rates, she reiterated that &quot;some monetary tightening&quot; would be needed to cool inflation and &quot;a little more&quot; magnitude than markets are expecting.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;limited&quot;.
The bank&#39;s downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next compare to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It kept its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision on no change comes after recent disappointing growth numbers dampened rising expectations for a rate hike and second-quarter GDP rose to 0.3% from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to come in at 0.3% in the third quarter, although according to the bank it will recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest Inflation Report offered little enthusiasm for households hit by rising inflation and modest pay rises, as the tightening will first get worse before set to improve.
She added that monetary policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; the collapse in incomes over the next few years, but added that wages will recover &quot;significantly&quot; by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy will also be boosted by rising demand for UK goods due to weak sterling, which will offset some of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Ahead of the bank&#39;s latest rate-rate ruling, calls for a rate hike had increased as inflation put pressure on hard-pressed budgets, with three policymakers calling for a hike to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has eased to 2.6% over the past month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and will pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was &quot;entirely&quot; attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers said: &quot;Given the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are clamoring for business and looking to end the year on a positive note.
The market is looking particularly good for those who are maturing their existing deals and getting new mortgages, and many with no-fee options and low rates are gaining popularity.&quot;
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be able to access &quot;transformative&quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a High Court battle against funding for the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service via an initial three-year study involving an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeal upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that gave the NHS the power to pay for PrEP despite claims that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as an &quot;important new intervention&quot; by NHS England boss Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a &quot;defining moment&quot;.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to enroll, with more clinics to follow in October before rolling out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are just enough drugs in a person&#39;s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken as little as two hours before intercourse every day or so.
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, trans people, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinicians will identify eligible participants who will consent to the study, including males, females, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England who are registered with a GP can also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The scheme is worth £10million and NHS England signed a deal to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is being targeted, taken up and implemented at scale.
Stevens said: &quot;This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity&#39;s greatest public health challenges.&quot;
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: &quot;This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted to those in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to transform the UK HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which will improve many, many lives leads.
We warmly welcome this announcement.&quot;
Ian Green, Chief Executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: &quot;The priority now must be to ensure that the study is rapidly rolled out across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people living with HIV.&quot;
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health secretary, said: &quot;After months of delays and hesitant government implementation, the start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study is carried out across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society come&#39;.
Living the Big Life: Mezzanines and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a lavish home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, downsized from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It&#39;s on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it&#39;s a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn&#39;t packed and sold her bags.
&quot;Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room,&quot; says Joanne.
&quot;I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.&quot;
Since the initial viewing, the 1,000 square foot home has had a complete makeover.
Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to make the most of the ample ceiling height.
&quot;I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,&quot; she says.
To that end, she commissioned Notting Hill-based Erfan Azadi architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Shed to take advantage of the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but a place to live for Joanne .
The ceiling was not large enough to fit two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine to stand on.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the challenge.
&quot;The steel mill is quite complicated,&quot; he explains.
&quot;We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.
It wasn&#39;t just about building a simple platform, but laying out the steel so that it was the right height for the function at the top or bottom.&quot;
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two full-height rooms on top of each other—with plenty of added drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic Retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents, and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units accommodate all of Joanne&#39;s cutlery and glasses.
Perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close off the kitchen when not in use.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
&quot;A bit of engineering went into that,&quot; explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
&quot;It&#39;s counterbalanced so when you slide the door up it slides very easily.&quot;
Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16m², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
&quot;At the end of the day, you&#39;re going to sell the floor space -- or how your property is valued,&quot; Erfan says.
&quot;In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and make a calculation based on floor size.&quot;
Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
&quot;The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,&quot; says Erfan.
&quot;You don&#39;t fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don&#39;t play with your heart.&quot;
It shows that good design and increased square footage can transform a home from something standard to something truly amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave this one.
Brothers fight over a $500 million real estate empire
Four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, two brothers find themselves locked in a spat over one of Victoria&#39;s largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors down from his younger brother Paul. He took him to the Supreme Court to see how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a heated argument over the split erupts in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 38 properties valued at more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood shop in 1973.
It was there that the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold for $85 million in 1999.
That money has been invested in real estate and the De Lutis portfolio now includes downtown offices, the developments of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping malls.
By agreement with her late father, Colin—described by Paul as &quot;the chief operator and the dominant figure&quot; in the De Lutis family—owns about two-thirds of the company&#39;s assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
A court filing says this means Colin owns $316 million in property and Paul owns $176 million.
Dividing real estate and cash has proven to be a pain point for Paul.
&quot;The partitions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best properties,&quot; he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are also now fighting for control of the existing business - which Paul claims Colin locked him out of.
Colin argues this is not true, instead accusing Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
&quot;My Italian heritage dictates that family is the number one priority,&quot; he wrote.
The cost is mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and involving leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950&#39;s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970&#39;s.
They used the security to purchase the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family&#39;s first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was &quot;in my senior years of high school, when Paul was just a little kid (about 10 years old).&quot;
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons amicably.
&quot;Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court,&quot; she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, &quot;have become embittered about the terms of their financial split.&quot;
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL board member and the TV star&#39;s best friend, according to a 2015 bio by Eddie McGuire.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.
Only Colin responded via text message to say &quot;I really can&#39;t say much&quot; because the case is before the courts.
&quot;It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and have our family name through the courts,&quot; he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our father wouldn&#39;t have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current argument,&quot; he said, adding that he &quot;still hopes for a resolution.&quot;
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
&quot;Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future,&quot; Colin wrote.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit the president&#39;s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information on President Trump -- including news media reports -- in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even tack.
Here&#39;s a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:
&quot;When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior officials on his first day on the job, he laid out a major problem in President Donald Trump&#39;s White House that he wants to fix: bad information getting into the President&#39;s hands .
Kelly told staff that information should flow about him -- whether on paper or in briefings -- because the president would make better decisions if given good information.&quot;
Kelly&#39;s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump&#39;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he&#39;s in the White House, his television advertising is still going strong.
&quot;When candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair reporting from agencies that needed persuading,&quot; former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico&#39;s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that &quot;the key to keeping Trump&#39;s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure his personal media consumption includes steady praise.&quot;
OK.
But the idea that Trump&#39;s Twitter habit was ever &quot;under control&quot; is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something the rest of us don&#39;t - that without their intervention, Trump&#39;s tweets would have been even more explosive.
We&#39;ll likely never know about the tweets Trump didn&#39;t send.
If his co-workers have managed to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts have paid off.
But nobody has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing factions, the people keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting material to Trump that might further their views of the world.
Politico -- deep in the story -- reported in May on the advisers&#39; penchant for providing the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
&quot;Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and become obsessed with finding out where they came from.
That&#39;s exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of &quot;being the source behind a bunch of leaks&quot; being in the White House.
Despite Johnson being permanently banned from Twitter for bullying or not offering concrete evidence or having made false allegations in the past and retracting them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh.&quot;
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter &quot;were trying to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives.&quot;
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisers still strive for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly&#39;s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted criminals are naturally not known, clues from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the campaign, which follows the &quot;EU Most Wanted&quot; advent calendar from winter.
According to Europol, experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding at holiday destinations.
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been put together.
The website www.eumostwanted has been around since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of those searched online have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of tips after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to &#39;Millionaire Row&#39;
Some of the West Midlands&#39; wealthiest homeowners are once again at loggerheads with some determined travellers, who have negotiated a council dug moat to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside an affluent Solihull street dubbed &#39;Millionaires Row&#39;.
They have brought horses, babies and an army of transports after being thrown out as recently as May, but have not been deterred by a ditch dug by the council to thwart their incursions.
The tactful group found a breach in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unobstructed to find a route.
Angry residents have harried Solihull Council, who said it was &quot;useless to deal with the issue&quot;.
An anonymous resident said: &quot;They moved there on Monday night after being redirected from Bentley Heath where they threw rocks at passers-by.
The Council must be shamed into action as it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today.&quot;
She added: &quot;Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long briefings to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I&#39;m not happy to keep paying my council tax when the council can&#39;t even stop it.&quot;
A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous, we&#39;ve only just seen the last round of these travelers only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area.&quot;
A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: &quot;We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihulls Police. We are taking the necessary legal action to ensure they move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 911.
This helps to create a picture of the situation where the court needs to consider when we present our case.&quot;
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house on the outskirts of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on March 1st next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by what was then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost at the time, as well as income from the visitor&#39;s tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing number of refugees coming to the district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the municipal council at the time.
Above all, Freudenstadt&#39;s Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious prospects for the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a three-star plus category hotel under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, rubbish containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings were partially dismantled, and old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do before March.
&quot;It&#39;s actually a nice hotel,&quot; says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms will be equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything should later become &quot;nicely citizen-friendly&quot;, as Thomas Scherer puts it.
&quot;We want to make a jewel out of it.&quot;
The facilities include a swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room.
Scherer emphasizes that they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but at a higher level in the city centre.
The Waldhotel Luise, with around 60 rooms, wants to expand, Scherer explains.
Both individual vacationers, groups and business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
According to Scherer, he has already had talks with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
&quot;We are on the same line.&quot;
When asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.
Just under a million euros, he calculates.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought into shape, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace will be created in an inner courtyard, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: &quot;Freudenstadt is a good market&quot;.
Russia affair: US special investigator uses grand jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has started work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump&#39;s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of intentionally interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump&#39;s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation is said to focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the election campaign.
Mueller was also reportedly scrutinizing Trump&#39;s private and business lives more and more.
The &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator has personally focused on Trump and is investigating the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The primary role of grand juries is to review existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
They are usually involved when the cases are larger and more controversial.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the public prosecutor&#39;s office to summon people for questioning under oath.
According to the broadcaster CNN, subpoenas have already been issued relating to the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting were asked to testify, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump&#39;s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will ultimately be involved in deciding whether to indict.
However, the appointment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
&quot;The Russia story is a total fabrication,&quot; Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to &quot;feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.&quot;
His special counsel, Ty Cobb, said in a statement he was unaware of the grand jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any measures that &quot;fairly&quot; expedite the work of the special counsel.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation.
There is no reason to assume that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller was only installed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, allegations against Trump had been raised that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to drop the investigation into then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under a lot of pressure over the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his staff.
That sparked speculation that Trump might want to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent special counsel for Congress, such as in the Watergate affair involving late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the President&#39;s urging.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators introduced bills Thursday that would make firing the special counsel more difficult.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg floating in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and covers an area of 5800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years before it has melted.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
It poses no danger to humans.
According to researchers, it is unclear to what extent climate change played a role in the break-off of the iceberg.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus that has now broken off was previously part of the Larsen C Ice Shelf.
Ice shelves float on the sea and are fed by large glaciers.
It grows further and further into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C Ice Shelf lies south of South America near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this ice shelf, the growth/breakdown balance was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf has collapsed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C Ice Shelf is also in danger, because the leading edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could crumble if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelves and icebergs does not raise sea levels because they float on water and ice displaces as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain away much faster than before.
That could eventually raise sea levels, but only by a small amount, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (MIDAS).
According to AWI, the Larsen C Ice Shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica at almost 50,000 square kilometers.
It is up to 700 meters thick at the transition from the mainland and around 200 meters at the front edge to the open ocean.
There it breaks off regularly.
&quot;Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position,&quot; said Martin O&#39;Leary of UK Swansea University.
&quot;This is the furthest drop since records began,&quot; he said.
There is debate among scientists as to whether the Larsen C Ice Shelf will grow again or whether it will be in long-term decline and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, &quot;Our models say it will be less stable.&quot;
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not attribute the break-off of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice cover of the Antarctic Peninsula has receded by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature contributed to the decrease.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers&#39; association to leave the association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district council approved 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
Apprenticeships at the district are obviously very popular.
Around 620 applications were received for the places to be allocated this year.
Nevertheless, the district still lacks staff to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
There are currently 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers as well as general administrative staff are sought after.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the district council together with the FDP and the UWG and counteract the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration should &quot;develop a concept for recruiting and developing personnel&quot;.
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The CDU, FDP and UWG demand that the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for career changers and include a training offensive.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the district is dealing with personnel problems that were previously unknown.
Other cities poach good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
There is talk of a real &quot;competition between public employers&quot;.
In addition, there are a large number of employees who retire due to illness or old age.
So it&#39;s high time to act so that no more positions remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU parliamentary group, goes beyond the joint application with his party.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district council when he publicly questioned the cap on personnel costs and amazed the other parties.
Völker wants all options to be reviewed that allow for a withdrawal from the municipal employers&#39; association.
&quot;If we don&#39;t find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should work with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the towns belonging to the district - to work towards an in-house tariff,&quot; says Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is attempting to pay employees and civil servants better than the collective bargaining system for the public sector actually provides.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is based on years of service.
But the tasks of the district have grown more and more in recent years.
Just a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, district administrator Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue doing so unless they comply with new rules governing their operations.
&quot;If NGOs don&#39;t sign a new code of conduct, it&#39;s difficult to see how they can continue working,&quot; Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti&#39;s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to the German aid organization Jugend Rettet because its crew had effectively colluded with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
&quot;For us, saving human life is and will remain our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment,&quot; the organization said in a statement on social media.
&quot;We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.&quot;
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the &#39;Jugend Rettet&#39; boat, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew takes on board dinghy migrants delivered directly to them by traffickers and allows the smugglers to leave so the ships can be used again.
At least one such clash allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor&#39;s filing, the contents of which were released by Italian media.
The crew are suspected of flouting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not any other motive.
Most importantly, under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the Code: Save the Children, Malta&#39;s MOAS and Spain&#39;s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail &quot;substantial changes or hindrances&quot; to their rescue operations.
Among those refusing to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy following the rescue efforts has fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and work with local mayors have borne fruit.
&quot;In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries hoping to reach Europe.
climbs and trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the &quot;Berlin Outpost&quot; and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
Viewpoints followed, some on towers, from which one could see far across the Palatinate Forest and the plains in front of it.
In between there were always longer climbs, which were rewarded with long trials.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Viewpoint after viewpoint lined up again, connected by &quot;flowy&quot; trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inns brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also headed for.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters in altitude, the group got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - in terms of sport and culture.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga is gearing up for e-sports
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of fighting their way across the stadium lawn, sweating through all kinds of weather?
The fact is: E-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
The first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognized this.
VfL Wolfsburg made the start in 2015, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
&quot;We hope that this will inspire completely new young target groups for VfB,&quot; says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is certain &quot;that a number of clubs will get on board this train&quot;.
The world football association FIFA is organizing the first &quot;Interactive Club World Cup&quot; in London next weekend, in which gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have all qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual soccer players.
&quot;Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, so that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future,&quot; says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, one could be present online in these markets far more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as &quot;League Of Legends&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;Counterstrike&quot; or the football simulation FIFA are fought at competitive level.
As in normal sport, leagues have long been established in which professionals compete against each other.
And at the Asian Games 2022, e-sports are already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea will certainly take some getting used to.
Ingo Froboese also grappled with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and the ability to react quickly.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
&quot;The fit player is a good player.&quot;
But Froboese also sees problems: &quot;Doping is becoming more and more of an issue&quot;.
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the structures of classic sports are missing in the scene.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players travel internationally, it&#39;s like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were turned over in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales should be 130 million.
That&#39;s not much compared to the almost 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga.
However, e-sports are &quot;not far removed from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,&quot; write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further along.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O&#39;Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are involved in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports bookmaker Unikrn.
A lot is also happening in Europe.
E-sports have been introduced as a subject in a Norwegian school, says Froboese.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the first division football clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
&quot;In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind,&quot; explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia and glorifying the old days is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
&quot;We live in a digitized world,&quot; agrees Dutt.
&quot;You can&#39;t just stick to the fact that football is the only thing that stays the way it always was.&quot;
Farewell to poison eggs - the egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal surrounding poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil should be placed on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of lyrics urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for texting and calling her boyfriend to encourage suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and has been suspended for five years.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy&#39;s father said at the hearing on Thursday: &quot;My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.&quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free pending appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood teary-eyed, hands clasped and eyes downcast as she was sentenced.
&quot;Your actions killed Conrad Roy,&quot; the prosecutor told the court.
&quot;She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility,&quot; she said.
&quot;She has shown no remorse&quot;.
But Carter&#39;s attorney said it was a &quot;terrible circumstance that she deeply regrets.&quot;
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that their &quot;age or level of maturity or even mental illness had any significant impact on their actions&quot;.
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy&#39;s mother, Lynn Roy, which said that &quot;there is not a day that I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity.&quot;
Roy&#39;s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was &quot;haunted&quot; by the realization that she would never attend her brother&#39;s wedding or be an aunt to his children.
&quot;Not having that one person that I&#39;ve been with every day since birth is a pain that I will always carry with me for the rest of my life,&quot; she said.
The case appears to set legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter&#39;s text messages revealed she encouraged him to end his life.
&quot;Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don&#39;t know, there are many ways,&quot; she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
In the moments leading up to his suicide, she wrote, &quot;You must do it, Conrad&quot; and &quot;All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.&quot;
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention from Roy&#39;s death and ordered that she take advantage of the case through any press.
The case divided legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the 2007 murder of her British flatmate in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times: &quot;Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail.&quot;
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from Bayern&#39;s new mini-lame
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was able to captain the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern believes the Confederation Cup winner can have a great season - extra motivation doesn&#39;t hurt.
Something was different in his place in the dressing room, Joshua Kimmich saw it immediately, even if the additional piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, he put the bandage assigned to him on his arm.
&quot;The coach didn&#39;t announce it,&quot; said the Confederation Cup winner after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the debut could have gone better than the 0:2 against SSC Napoli.
But Kimmich could also interpret the sign from the coach.
Arturo Vidal, eight years older than him, was not chosen as captain in the C-Elf, which consisted of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just returned from vacation.
One likes to hand out sweets to those who one trusts a lot, who one wants to keep in a good mood.
So anyone who has been chosen to inherit from Lahm can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: &quot;That&#39;s what you want as a player: take responsibility&quot;.
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old raced across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that&#39;s his position now, the white bandage on his arm did the rest.
And anyway, in this starting formation, Kimmich seemed like the one who can take the helm best.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the uncoordinated troops.
He saw the big picture while many others were preoccupied with themselves.
Vidal to cover up his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches, come hell or high water to build on the achievements of the Asia trip (it only worked to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not attracting negative attention in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
Anyway, that worked quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently.
The well-known Napoli-Sturm often found it difficult, and Süle also tried a few times to build up the game successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result &quot;wasn&#39;t what we had hoped for&quot;.
But he also put in a decent performance on his debut.
Change of game, change of pace: &quot;I was also brought in for this style&quot;.
How unusual this Bayern world is for the newcomers was evident after the game.
Rudy, for example, didn&#39;t give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but at least six or seven.
After a few crisp statements, Kimmich said goodbye to his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: &quot;I&#39;ve already noticed what&#39;s going on here.
At Bayern you just have to win every game&quot;.
After all, he no longer has to teach the newcomers.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria&#39;s best-known footballer tweeted shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is practically a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is rooting for our ladies.
The tweet from the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Our ladies could also use the famous Bayern Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Industry praises Wissing&#39;s pace
The relationship between the state and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Economics Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economics Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) has been in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy when asked on TV - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: &quot;Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, all of which Lemke blocked&quot;.
Natus sees the greatest reversal in infrastructure policy: Closing the gap in Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the state&#39;s list of priorities.
The ministry is hoping for a plan approval procedure before the end of this year, and the building permit should be in place by 2021.
The western bypass of Trier, which is a priority in the Federal Transport Routes Plan, also plays a role in the state&#39;s plans.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been falling for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new foreman bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A bonus of 1000 euros is planned for passing the master craftsman&#39;s examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the master&#39;s training.
But the country&#39;s homework list remains long.
With the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the state lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, general manager of the Trier Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state office for mobility, only 29 positions have been filled so far.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU faction deputy Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the state is investing more than 20 million euros less in maintaining state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus is also expecting a concept from the state on how it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only gave the grid supply a grade of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about faltering internet connections and crashes.
Ex-Economics Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she left after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face backlash
A day before Audi&#39;s announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes &quot;there are smarter options than driving restrictions&quot;, referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
Neither company described the ventures as a recall.
European automobile manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralize exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful auto companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used so-called cut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but back off under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi&#39;s engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face a trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a German criminal investigation into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and an inquiry centered on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen&#39;s profits.
The raft on the Isar has this message on Saturday
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that visitors to the Isar can also take part, a raft with a special message will travel through Munich tomorrow, Saturday.
Anyone who is drawn to the Isar again on Saturday will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information banner.
It shows a mountain of rubbish.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to visitors to the Isar.
With the motto &quot;True love is ...&quot; the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worthy of protection should be sharpened.
The raft already crossed the Isar last summer and this year there are further campaigns and measures to achieve considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo&#39;s bulbous noses and laughter against suffering
At one point, Mordillo was one of the most widely published cartoon artists, and his characters&#39; bulbous noses are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laughter, &quot;because there is too much suffering in the world&quot;.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 to Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the early years as an artist, he struggled through, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
&quot;The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job,&quot; he once said.
After working in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in &quot;Paris Match&quot; and then also in &quot;Stern&quot; and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist was repeatedly inspired by cities.
Large, plump Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
According to his own statements, he still sits at the drawing table early in the morning and works almost ten hours a day.
His droll figures continue to be widely distributed around the world in the form of calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches.
He has also been working on an animated film and a TV series with his characters for the past six years.
The main character in the film &quot;Crazy Island&quot; is a giraffe - Mordillo&#39;s favorite animal in his drawings - who has a centipede as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is due to hit cinema screens in 2019.
&quot;I don&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re going to say, it&#39;s strange to me,&quot; says Mordillo.
The screenplay is not written by him.
That&#39;s why he prefers the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It&#39;s become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there&#39;s a warning it&#39;s threatened by climate change.
Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert from the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: &quot;The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
There&#39;s also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits leafhoppers, and in very dry weather there&#39;s a lot of them.&quot;
And the stakes are high.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in great demand for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: &quot;Instead of having very long plant ears with large numbers of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, and either absent or weakened.
So we have fewer essential oil parts.&quot;
Solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing cultivars that are more drought-resistant.
The town of Geisa in the Rhön region of Thuringia is celebrating its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Grocers, guilds, traders, vagabonds or a lansquenet camp should be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staffers at the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on Sinaloa State&#39;s recent chaos at the hands of organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: bring their children, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, to the office or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a plaque at the front of the room: Enemies, Neutrals, Allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on government or cartel payrolls, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists have joined the ranks: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
&quot;The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word &quot;Justice&quot; hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in their thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his signature Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death and the reporters discuss their common issues, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor&#39;s office was established in 2010 to handle journalists&#39; cases, it has only initiated two criminal cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists rarely bring the killers to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on covering the violence of Sinaloa, heartbroken and even though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security is of little use, Ibarra says.
&quot;It&#39;s very foolish to waste my time in this workshop,&quot; he says.
&quot;Until we know why, we distrust everyone.&quot;
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the offices of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was pulled over by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably because of the newspaper&#39;s name - which translates to &quot;Twelfth River&quot;.
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly loose in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman&#39;s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country&#39;s bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
It doesn&#39;t matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kingpins that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot;quiet&quot; when only one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt of failing to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman&#39;s sons.
This publication may have angered the Sons, with suspected gang members buying up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was failing to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexico&#39;s violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be around.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 equity interests.
In Sinaloa, &quot;it was impossible to do journalism without running into the drug problem,&quot; Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious &quot;Maria Moors Cabot Prize&quot; for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists&#39; International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing Mexico&#39;s drug history, wherever it led.
He freely admitted that he was scared.
&quot;I want to live on,&quot; he said at the time of the CPJ awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa &quot;is a way of life,&quot; he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
&quot;You have to take on the job that falls to you as a journalist - either that or play the fool.
I don&#39;t want to be asked, &quot;With so many dead, what did you do...why didn&#39;t you say what was going on?&quot;
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who could swear like a docker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs while staying alive.
&quot;They don&#39;t like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine runways&quot; to move drugs.
&quot;These things were not allowed,&quot; Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that &quot;smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happened.&quot;
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly not allowed in the room where Riodoce employees met for safety training. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers took shelter from the 104 degrees (40C) heat under the shade of a tree.
They were hired by the state government to protect Riodoce&#39;s offices in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It&#39;s been months since reporters went to the mountainous terrain where the drug gangs are under de facto control.
For this week&#39;s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former popular boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a government spending exposé that focused on the governor&#39;s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the DA&#39;s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite haunt of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of politics for most of the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the venue, including one in which a son of &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman escaped a military ambush.
Just months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez&#39;s column as the most informed source on the kidnapping.
&quot;We would have known what happened earlier,&quot; said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; for his slim build.
&quot;Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office has been repurposed as a repository for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because staff have become what they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor&#39;s office the next morning to protest over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was discovered and officials say it is his based on DNA testing.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal, writing &quot;SOS Press&quot; on sidewalks and structures in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez&#39;s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be reassigned by the government because she is concerned her anger violated her objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot;surrounded&quot; by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
&quot;In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up,&quot; Ramirez said.
Apparently the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note said to be signed by the Zetas Cartel: &quot;Here I am for my reports.&quot;
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the March assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Others are carrying on, as did Nuevo Laredo&#39;s El Manana after the assassination of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly targeted the drug cartels with a front-page editorial headlined &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It&#39;s a painful decision.
It&#39;s hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets, looking for danger.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it&#39;s a daily dance of risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits the drug trade terrifies him.
&quot;Mexico is going to hell and that&#39;s why I became a reporter,&quot; he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when all of a sudden their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they published the news on Riodoce&#39;s website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby - another gun battle in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the officers standing guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were afraid at all, they didn&#39;t show it.
Under the massive portrait of the newspaper&#39;s fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce staff followed in his footsteps.
&quot;How can you even consider closing,&quot; Bojorquez said, &quot;when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to put her out on the street to report.&quot;
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid its enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first glimpses of a Canadian miner&#39;s incredible rhinoceros were so well preserved that experts have described it as the &#39;Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs&#39;.
It was so well preserved that they could even tell its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and they said it had something of a &quot;troubled past&quot;.
The report in Current Biology called it &quot;the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the finest specimens of dinosaur in the world.&quot;
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has stunned researchers, who describe it as &quot;truly remarkable&quot;.
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) clod of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.
&quot;If you blink your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe it was asleep,&quot; said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
&quot;It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved specimens of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.&quot;
Researchers have found that although this herbivore is covered in armor and resembles a walking tank, it was likely threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend in better with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting it may have been threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature of the nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal, naming it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.
The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered countershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the creature&#39;s top was darker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, as Borealopelta&#39;s size far exceeds that of animals alive today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that employ countershading—think deer, zebra, or armadillo—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle for survival.
&quot;Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaur predators must have been,&quot; Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur&#39;s skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents, to find out what it ate for its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it got caught in a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were probably much further inland than they are today.
&quot;This nodosaurus is really remarkable because it&#39;s completely covered in preserved scaly skin, but it&#39;s also preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal&#39;s original shape,&quot; Brown said.
&quot;The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don&#39;t need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you squint your eyes just a little bit, you could almost believe he&#39;s asleep.&quot;
The Cretaceous Period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the earth.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank under the sea and became mummified in the mud after it died.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk while digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it&#39;s the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to rump.
The creatures averaged about 18 feet (5 meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch spikes protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe the armored herbivore swept through western Canada until a flooded river swept it out to sea.
But the dinosaur&#39;s underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of skin still cover bumpy armor plates along the length of the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as &#39;rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it gets.
Petrified remains of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that support the animal&#39;s skull.
His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on its sole&#39;.
In the thunderstorm: pile-up on A8: many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a pile-up.
There are numerous injuries, miles of traffic jams - and onlookers.
Around 20 people were injured in a pile-up on the Stuttgart-Munich autobahn (A8) late Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, crashed into each other.
No information was initially available on the exact number of people injured.
A police spokesman said the injuries were minor to moderate.
A large contingent of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of around ten kilometers formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstructions on the oncoming lane - by numerous onlookers.
The fire brigade wrote down the license plate numbers of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with severe penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests &quot;comfort check-in&quot;
It&#39;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced at least once: You sit on the train and sleep, not suspecting anything.
Or you are engrossed in your work and just have a brilliant idea.
And then: puff.
The conductor comes and wakes you up roughly or pulls the passenger out of the workflow.
ticket control.
But the days of interruptions will soon be over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing conductorless ticket inspection.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thereby validate the ticket.
Test operations are currently running on two routes.
&quot;If the offer goes through, we&#39;ll expand it.
It will then probably be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year,&quot; said a railway spokesman.
&quot;Comfort check-in&quot; is what Deutsche Bahn calls ticket validation without a conductor.
In order to be able to use it, however, a few requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You also have to have bought it via the Deutsche Bahn app, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because &quot;Comfort Check-in&quot; works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under &quot;My Tickets&quot;.
A button for electronic validation then appears for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train conductor comes to seat Y during ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger with an already validated online ticket is sitting there.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The &quot;check-in&quot; has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
&quot;Anyone who wants to travel in a relaxed manner without having their tickets checked by our train attendants can simply check in themselves in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to personalize their travel time on the train,&quot; says Michael Peterson, Board Member for Marketing at DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: &quot;And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs&quot;.
Anyone who often travels by train knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because you often do not have all the documents with you that you need to validate online tickets, but in any case one of the passengers does not have them with you.
Either the credit card or the identity card or another document that you have to show is missing.
The consequences are endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad atmosphere in the compartment or the large area and delays in checking your own tickets, and ultimately takes the time away from the conductor to take care of other matters.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question, &quot;Whose Streets?&quot;
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone in high school.
&quot;Police just killed an 18-year-old child and he&#39;s still lying on the street,&quot; it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she shut down Facebook and opened up on Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown&#39;s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours.
&quot;That&#39;s wild,&quot; Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were photos of police tape and people shouting and of a man claiming to be Brown&#39;s father carrying a sign that read, &quot;Ferguson&#39;s police just killed my unarmed son!&quot;
She watched a live feed showing a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer cocked his gun and yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you... animals all.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not common,&quot; Ferrell recalled her statement.
&quot;This is not the kind of murder that we have become accustomed to and can call typical.&quot;
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.&quot;
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father&#39;s house and decided the two of them would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, &quot;Whose Streets?&quot;, in theaters May 11.
It&#39;s a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, set through the eyes of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two went over a conversation they&#39;d had countless times before that morning &quot;about the black experience and the black condition.&quot;
&quot;You remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe in?&quot; she remembered what she said.
&quot;We&#39;re going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn&#39;t right.
I couldn&#39;t take her with me,&quot; Ferrell later said.
&quot;What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see and be raised in it.
She needs to be well developed, not just activism and organization, but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free, to liberate ourselves.
While I&#39;m fortunate enough to give her an experience where she doesn&#39;t personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I&#39;d be doing her a disservice by keeping her out of it.&quot;
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location across from the police department that became a camp area as activists awaited Officer Darren Wilson&#39;s possible non-charge.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them to protesters.
A new kind of activism for Ferrell slowly began to take shape.
&quot;My activism totally changed after August 9,&quot; she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food equity and health inequalities in black communities.
&quot;I had no organizing experience.
It all came.&quot;
Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film&#39;s co-directors.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to &quot;document&quot; what was happening.
One question came to Ferrell&#39;s mind: &quot;Are you going to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?&quot;
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases from people, often whites, in a community that thrived on their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, &quot;We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn&#39;t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently.&quot;
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team from &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; in the years after Brown&#39;s shooting.
&quot;This documentary isn&#39;t someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We talk,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that&#39;s how I&#39;m going to be portrayed.&quot;
The goal wasn&#39;t to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experience — to show that the movement is &quot;not about a messianic leader, it&#39;s a community that&#39;s coming together,&quot; Folayan said — it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell&#39;s life, falling in love and marrying her wife.
&quot;I felt like I was naked,&quot; Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
&quot;But I understood that there has to be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.&quot;
Additionally, Ferrell&#39;s story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film &quot;BlacklivesMatter&quot; on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
&quot;Black gay women leaders have carried the movement as a whole,&quot; Ferrell said, &quot;and so we&#39;re constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black gay women have to bear the brunt of everything.&quot;
Folayan agreed, noting that &quot;the movement is really being held up by black women and a lot of black women&quot;.
However, she insists that &quot;this is not an affirmative type of action&quot; in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film.
&quot;She was the person who shook up that energy,&quot; she said.
&quot;It&#39;s no coincidence, even though she was on the front lines, because there&#39;s so much at stake living at these crossroads as a black gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen.&quot;
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson are long gone, but racial ties between the community and the police linger.
Ferrell is on probation for 2½ years for blocking a freeway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home: &quot;A mess&quot;.
Still, she clings to a chant, and she&#39;s been committed to that memory ever since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
&quot;It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.&quot;
From &quot;dream&quot; to &quot;megalomania&quot;: TV readers discuss the bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping center at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since it was first presented in 2009.
The topic hardly leaves anyone cold.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot;Friend of the People Bitburg&quot;.
While some say about the bit gallery: &quot;That would be a dream&quot; (Anja Becker) or &quot;That would be really great&quot; (Nicole Schausten), on the other hand: &quot;No one needs it&quot; (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: &quot;Megalomania!&quot; (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters count on a gallery attracting more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed dry.
What&#39;s more, the gallery is being planned on exactly the same site as the farmers&#39; market hall, where 13 direct marketers will offer their products.
This will come to an end when the construction work begins.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - facing Bede Square with the option of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: &quot;We have been shopping in the farmers&#39; market almost every week for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes made by the country women.
We also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like to have a chance to continue this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
This is also the case in other cities.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting.&quot;
Gerd Densing: &quot;Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the rent.
But that shouldn&#39;t be exactly low with the new project.&quot;
Eva Kilic: &quot;Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.
There&#39;s enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
Since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly from the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not affordable for a retailer.
It&#39;s a pity, there are almost no specialist shops anymore and what&#39;s left of it will probably disappear.&quot;
Wolf Fandel: &quot;For me, a shopping center with a market hall doesn&#39;t go together.
And the gallery doesn&#39;t fit in Bitburg.
Above all: where should the farmers&#39; market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - also in the long term, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or will the Bit-Galerie ghost manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg before that?&quot;
George Marquet: &quot;It&#39;s just not going to work.
And nobody needs a shopping center that is empty.
I think it would have been better to sponsor a real farmer&#39;s market instead of this gallery.
But there is no longer any room for a farmers&#39; market hall thanks to the insane number of - in my opinion - senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers&#39; market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear.&quot;
A fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning&#39;s DNA
In the center of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, almost subtly alike - hanging from cables hanging from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence after leaking classified diplomatic leaks via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computing and the arts, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he was just three days in his had office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has made a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, comment not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has been open about identifying as a woman since she was a teenager, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by prison, so much so that there was only a single photo — a grainy, black-and-white selfie of Manning visibly uncomfortable in a driver&#39;s seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig — with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had just come from the huge success of her 2012 project &#39;Stranger Visions&#39;.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like.
That&#39;s when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
&quot;They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn&#39;t be visited at the time and she couldn&#39;t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a Suppressed Images comic, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future where the President would commute Chelsea&#39;s sentence and she would be able to see the exhibit in person.
That Obama would actually call for Manning&#39;s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of fortunate coincidence.
There&#39;s something deep and powerful about the opening of the exhibition, too, now that Donald Trump is waging a war against government whistleblowers and transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to resolve the rigid divisions he was meant to mend. continue to ignite.
When asked about the odd timing of all these things, Dewey-Hagborg said that &quot;things happen for a reason&quot;.
In an artistic statement inscribed on the gallery wall, Manning, with her oversized signature below it (the &quot;i&quot; in her family name is followed by a heart), called for an end to &quot;the automatic fragmentation that has been based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. &quot;
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist&#39;s sophisticated scientific lexicon), to show how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
&quot;What I hope people will take away from this is that our genome doesn&#39;t care about who we are and how open genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is,&quot; said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories , can also be seen.
&quot;DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that&#39;s 30 of those stories.&quot;
The final piece in the exhibition, kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
It shows Manning emerging from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong, speakerphone in hand.
&quot;If they cold your speech, then they&#39;ve won,&quot; they say.
&quot;So never shut up&quot;.
&quot;It came right out of a letter she wrote me,&quot; said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
&quot;I still get goosebumps talking about it.&quot;
Manning has yet to see the exhibit in person - as was presciently anticipated in the comic book - but if she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra, moving like hordes rally of protesters.
That was also purposeful, as was everything in the exhibit, right down to the height (5&quot; 2, Manning&#39;s stature) at which their genetic haplogroups were penciled.
&quot;In the past I&#39;ve had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,&quot; said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
&quot;I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation.&quot;
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff wanted for manslaughter
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Arrest warrants for murder were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court filings show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
A community alert system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on leave and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
&quot;This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation,&quot; Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that &quot;we are in contact with police in the UK and stand ready to assist US investigative authorities in any way we can.&quot;
The statement added that Warren&#39;s colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he urges the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
&quot;Police have an idea of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very gruesome.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also happened on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were inside the building.
&quot;We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,&quot; Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: &quot;Police are currently working on the victim&#39;s timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.&quot;
&quot;We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future&quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
&quot;At a certain stage of fulfilling the roadmap criteria, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard,&quot; Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA&#39;s Code Compliance Roadmap, which outlines the criteria for RUSADA&#39;s reinstatement, recently published on the organization&#39;s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
&quot;Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,&quot; he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported findings of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: &quot;We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we&#39;re not going to admit something that doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;
Mutko&#39;s words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia&#39;s independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted to past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: &quot;We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,&quot; Smirnov added.
In November 2015, RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping controls in Russia by WADA in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she has been allowed to schedule and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After visiting the organization&#39;s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is &quot;moving in the right direction&quot; to be reinstated.
Aldi is no longer selling eggs
This was announced by the corporate groups.
It is a purely precautionary measure and no health impairment can be assumed, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs that have been proven to be negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice agents can be delivered to Aldi.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The startups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn&#39;t work.
Responses were often vague, unhelpful, or worse, fraudulent.
And even when she promised anonymity, some workers didn&#39;t trust the process.
&quot;There was just never any consistency or objectivity,&quot; said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called outside people for help.
A new breed of human resources startups is burgeoning to help companies find out how their employees are feeling.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide employee anonymity and grievance hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and go directly to the board of directors.
&quot;You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where&#39;s the Fitbit for your business?&quot; said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained better insight into what her employees are thinking and feeling over the three years with Glint.
In addition to Snap polls and surveys by specific teams, it provides a Company Heat Map that shows at a glance which units have the most grievances and which executives have low approval scores - so you can drill down into why.
Companies are coming to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture lest they become the next Uber embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment at where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial engineering website Let&#39;s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a surge of interest and activity earlier this year amid the discredited Uber case.
Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized &quot;pulse&quot; surveys, collect confidential real-time responses, and view heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline for employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go straight to the board of directors.
&quot;The court of public opinion has gripped the regulators,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent&#39;s founder and chief executive officer.
If a company is found treating its employees badly or behaving unethically, it can face costly consequences through consumer boycotts, worker turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for corporate headquarters, make a formal complaint, and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday&#39;s general counsel, who said there wasn&#39;t a good way to track employee grievances.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives sitting in city or state offices—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be more quickly identified and addressed.
&quot;I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view of the employment experience,&quot; said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday&#39;s risk management group.
&quot;And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation.&quot;
Businesses began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical violations in the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it wasn&#39;t until &quot;social media came into its own&quot; that companies realized they couldn&#39;t keep their dirty laundry from getting online.
&quot;Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,&quot; he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies recurring fees for using their products.
It&#39;s a business model and an opportunity that has been endorsed by venture capital investors who have backed both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in February funding from companies including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing total capital to $47 million.
Sparkles secured $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There&#39;s a growing body of research showing that today&#39;s workforce expects more from their jobs than they used to.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
&quot;When people are happy to be at a company, feel that their voices are heard and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,&quot; said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies do well. Businesses thrive when employees work hard and are engaged.
When third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it&#39;s no wonder you&#39;re finding support.
Employee engagement data is important according to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if a company&#39;s administrators don&#39;t take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And when change doesn&#39;t come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
&quot;If you&#39;re asking for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,&quot; said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too heavily on data collection .
&quot;Because if you don&#39;t follow, employees will be like, &#39;Did you really hear me?
Take care of that?
And if you don&#39;t care, why should I? &quot;
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, has been able to take action the same day when an issue is reported through Glint, Errett said.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, the speed of decision making and the quality of communication enabled her to reorganize several teams within the company and add communications training to address the issues.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company continues to gain new insights about its employees, and it hopes that, over the long term, it will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high turnover.
&quot;If you&#39;re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you&#39;re going to lose people,&quot; Vitrano said.
&quot;And when you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA is eliminating the two-day practices and making a long day for the Bruins
It&#39;s 11 p.m. as a crowd of UCLA football players converse on one side of the team&#39;s new on-campus practice fields.
Some have removed their jersey tops, revealing backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good portion of the team, those idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return after the three-hour practice session for their final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
&quot;It&#39;s a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days,&quot; Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day drills to lighten the players&#39; burden, and it&#39;s actually lengthened its days -- at least until Friday&#39;s finals.
Therefore, UCLA&#39;s first three practice sessions were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players&#39; already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day that saw the Bruins delay the start of camp nearly a week after last season and practice during summer school for the first time in Mora&#39;s six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 drills over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their opener against Texas A&amp;M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA&#39;s rule change, even as it adds another point to players&#39; busy routes.
&quot;We put this enormous load on them for three or four days and it&#39;s very challenging,&quot; said Mora.
&quot;And they just pushed through, they keep pushing, they&#39;re amazing people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it&#39;s going to be really great.&quot;
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is over, which is given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already had footballs pelted clearing a safety net behind a goalpost , will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be an issue once those rooms become vacant during the season.
&quot;We will use our security,&quot; said Mora.
&quot;It&#39;s a real problem and it&#39;s not far-fetched to think that people would rent a room there and then go there and set up to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape from an exercise, it&#39;s a pretty good deal.
But we have security there, and we have security in parking lot 8.
We&#39;ll do the best we can with what we have.
I&#39;m not too concerned about that.
We have a plan.&quot;
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook plans to send more potential hoax articles to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world&#39;s largest online social network said Thursday. It&#39;s one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect potential false reports and send them to fact-checkers, who may display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, which many believe also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being inundated with false stories ahead of May&#39;s presidential election, and Germany backing a plan to punish social media networks when they fail , to quickly eliminate hateful postings like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
&quot;Beyond knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,&quot; Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its &quot;related article&quot; feature and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Graphic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
More recently, tiny Scotney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of tumultuous history from his cozy perch in Kent&#39;s Bewl River valley and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
&quot;I think it&#39;s so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who&#39;s been dead for 300 years,&quot; he says wistfully.
&quot;What a personal connection to hold this letter in my hand.&quot;
&#39;A Castle in England&#39; spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It&#39;s not Rhodes&#39; first book to be based on an archive: he wrote &#39;Dead Men&#39;s Teeth and Other Stories&#39; in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
&quot;I only reacted that way to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent working for the Jacobins in the 1700s,&quot; he says.
&quot;That&#39;s his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days people lit a fire for the light.
For someone living 300 years later, the smell has the effect of being there too.
Oh, I love archives!&quot;
For someone so wrapped up in paperwork that he&#39;s supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England, and lived in a castle for almost four months (&quot;To be honest, I overstated my welcome a little&quot;), that all seems like it to be too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian &#39;new&#39; castle, perusing the archives and studying the castle&#39;s many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the moat.
He would wander the grounds and ruins of the old castle, speaking to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes the artists who worked on his book&#39;s illustrations.
Then, at night, he &quot;drank whiskey and started writing&quot;.
Scotney&#39;s intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff was just beginning to tend to the archive, which he described as &quot;hundreds of years of aristocrats saying, &#39;Oh, throw it in the attic.&#39;
Diaries, letters from the English Empire period, maps showing who owned what: &quot;You&#39;d think land conflicts would be boring,&quot; says Rhodes, &quot;but there was a birch tree that two families fought over.
Boys, let everything take its course!&quot;
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a jumping off point to delve into broader English history, including &#39;The Labourer&#39; which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasants&#39; Revolt of 1381.
&quot;There is a record of a riot occurring at the castle in 1380 in this book called &#39;Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,&#39;&quot; says Rhodes.
&quot;The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?&quot;
Other stories are firmly rooted in the castle&#39;s history - such as &#39;The Priest&#39; which tells the story of the Jesuit Father whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or &#39;The Smuggler&#39;, which portrays 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with rocks (a discovery not made until years later when his coffin was unearthed) .
The Darrells are Rhodes&#39; favorite Scotney family: &quot;The gentlemen seemed to be quite the crooks, always running into debt and spending money on things they couldn&#39;t afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I picture them as a bunch of handsome boys with a knack for wooing heiresses.&quot;
After his stint at the Castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He completed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that nature has since reclaimed.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
&quot;I was sad to leave,&quot; he says.
It was like, &quot;Oh, now I have to deal with my damn life again.&quot;
Campaign started: over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf wrapped up
With the wrapping of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand on Friday (Rundschau from Thursday).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
&quot;Too beautiful for us.
Or?&quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
&quot;We don&#39;t really think so (of course!),&quot; they write on their website, which was released yesterday.
&quot;But we are using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they appear.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we, as Bad Honnefer citizens, are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city.&quot;
The campaign is about more than &quot;just&quot; a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
&quot;It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling point&quot;.
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is spending a mid-five-digit amount on its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan&#39;s fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) meets in Ankara to discuss retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So also this week.
At first glance, this is a normal process.
But nothing is routine for Turkey&#39;s armed forces a year on from the attempted coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister&#39;s office.
The five deputy prime ministers and the ministers for defence, interior, justice and foreign affairs now also took part in the deliberations chaired by the head of government.
This meant that the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is tightening the reins on the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the attempted coup have been tried in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan described the attempted coup as a &quot;godsend&quot; because it gave him the opportunity to &quot;completely cleanse&quot; the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper &quot;Hurriyet&quot; published an article entitled &quot;Discomfort at military headquarters&quot;.
The newspaper wrote that there were concerns among the general staff about the increasing &quot;Islamization&quot; of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers.
In any case, the cleaning up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7,395 civil servants fired by decree, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real rulers of the country.
They staged a coup three times, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan gradually pushed back the power of the military, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately driving the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine &quot;Vocal Europe&quot; an unnamed officer who sought asylum abroad after the attempted coup for fear of persecution warned that in a few years the Turkish army would be &quot;full of extremists and Salafists&quot;.
If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there are doubts in the alliance about the operational readiness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot;weakened,&quot; say NATO diplomats.
Washington is changing the rules for the green card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change green card rules, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work permit visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
&quot;This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.&quot;
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate skills that will benefit our economy,&quot; Trump said, quoted by American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for Rennsteig shuttle
The future of the Rennsteig shuttle has been the subject of repeated arguments over the past few months - now things should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, work is to be carried out on the dilapidated route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route is to begin before the end of this year.
&quot;With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the state is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism,&quot; said Secretary of State for Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at around 2.5 million euros.
The state takes over 75 percent of this sum.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the state in the future, is currently being finalized, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as the operator have already agreed on the technical details.
&quot;The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have thus been negotiated,&quot; said Sühl.
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a train connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig train stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In the course of a pilot operation in the past few months, a test was carried out to determine whether the route was used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also in parts very dilapidated.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned
Just when you thought 2017 couldn&#39;t get any crazier than this, a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot field arrives.
Yes indeed.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot&#39;s eye color, nipple shape, and fingernail type.
&quot;People make fun of them, but companies are shipping a lot of them and we&#39;re going to see them a lot more,&quot; said Mr Sharkey on the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that&#39;s warm to the touch - with deliberately human responses achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also &quot;customize&quot; their robot according to their beliefs, choosing everything from the color of the robot&#39;s eyes, to the shape of its nipples, to the type or color of its fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling as many robots possess the &quot;personalities&quot; that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to customize their robots to have traits they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the True Companion-developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with pre-programmed personalities like &quot;Frigid Farrah&quot; who gives the impression of shyness and &quot;Wild Wendy&quot; with an &quot;adventurous&quot; personality.
&quot;Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible,&quot; enthuses True Companion&#39;s website.
So she likes what you like and she doesn&#39;t like what you don&#39;t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be &quot;in the mood&quot;!&quot;
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics that hint at rape when taking a step towards frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah are worrying one most.
On its website, True Companion likened Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
&quot;If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can&#39;t men have Roxxxy?&quot; it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional extra.
Most men will not, of course, own sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for the time being.
But what is transpiring from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the times we live in.
And a lot of people aren&#39;t weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to be.
There&#39;s some overlap, though, that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women&#39;s rights are under threat around the world, when there&#39;s a President in the White House who has boasted about sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series &#39;The Handmaid&#39;s Tale&#39; is not the graphic imagery, the entwined bodies and gouged eyes, but how realistic that vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn&#39;t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their &quot;personalities,&quot; the robots don&#39;t represent actual women.
They cannot part with their companion or simply walk away.
They have no mediation or backstory, nothing suggesting independence or anything to disturb the fantasy of total submission.
In other words, they are obliging slaves.
Or to put it in 2017 idiom: maids
Trump&#39;s great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We are all supposedly making an effort to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been Trump&#39;s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including Republican kin with whom she had fought over politics for decades, is suddenly and oddly on the same page.
That&#39;s certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in a broader context that it also entails considerable risks.
The left has been empowered by Trump, but the disfiguring impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about &quot;normalization&quot; and Trump, we&#39;re referring to the chilling possibility that one day we won&#39;t be repelled by his antics.
There is an even more chilling long-term scenario, however, in which Trump &quot;normalizes&quot; right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of sanity by his standards.
I find myself gripped by an active nostalgia these days for Mitt Romney&#39;s hilarious version of the lunatic - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which compared to Trump, in fact, as one very mild offenses occur.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee need only be sane to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we would take our kids to the Central Park Carousel, the largest of the New York City Parks Department&#39;s carousels, and the best three dollars to spend in town if you don&#39;t need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns snarl and the animals twist to look over their shoulders in fear - supremely sinister, and the strumming music oddly conveys this.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings grow old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city doesn&#39;t live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I&#39;m still not quite over the day, when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not Swiss Cottage - Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub doesn&#39;t count - but a major roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel is still an oddly magical experience, however, as two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can all ride it and have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel I would have given it full marks but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week at a department store, I was forced to rate my transaction &quot;experience&quot; on a scale of one to five stars before I could swipe my credit card.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to match the review with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
Not only does this slow down what should be a neutral exchange, but it also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood there grinning apologetically while I wearily had the experience of handing her my five star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pains
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
He was hospitalized last year for treatment for cuts on his wrists, which prison authorities say he suffered after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against an initial manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine&#39;s Day 2013 by shooting multiple times at her through a toilet stall door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he mistook his girlfriend for a late-night intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal Pistorius&#39; six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius risks having his sentence increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were the last of the Blumberg schools to be released for vacation and secondary schools.
In the future, three of the discharge students will go to grammar school and four to secondary school.
Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public to the Biesental community center in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol for the dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken yard, but is then released into the wild.
In addition, the lively group performed a musical entitled &quot;The Eagle in the Chicken Yard&quot;.
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let his hens incubate it.
Instead of a chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was dashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank&#39;s rehearsal.
The hens danced in competition with the young roosters, who wore top hats.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that they felt accepted in their new school.
Words of thanks followed to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly stepped in when there were bottlenecks in teaching, and the parents&#39; representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students sang a song about summertime and vacation time.
The children erupted with great joy.
Eight first graders have already signed up for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, quoted by TV.
On the morning of August 1st, in Sithonia, the police arrested a group of people camping illegally, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping, and are imposing significant fines on anyone found staying in a place not meant for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behavior of cars in the Euro 5 and, in some cases, Euro 6 emission classes.
This does not apply to Euro 4 diesel or worse.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new promotion mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
&quot;The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have cheat software,&quot; says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to everyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done as part of it.
How long should the conversions take in total?
&quot;It&#39;s hard to say,&quot; says Smetanin.
That depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
&quot;Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily when it comes to the environment.&quot;
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It can be more time consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don&#39;t drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait and see.
According to Smetanin, foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit.
Is there now a massive drop in prices for Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are imminent.
In rural areas there has not been any loss in value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Honors
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees this year.
The awards will be presented in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony with his wife Melania.
Lear, who has become known for his progressive TV series, has therefore already announced that he will not be attending the gala.
He told the New York Times: &quot;This presidency has chosen to completely neglect—even defund—the arts and human rights, and that weighs on me.&quot;
Estefan, 59, stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to get her point of view clear.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural facility in the US capital.
Past honorees include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living in
Roland Wacker, Haslach&#39;s master builder, will retire next year.
The position has already been advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been the city master builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys his work a lot, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application has met the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
In this way, there should still be enough time for induction, taking into account the regular notice periods.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have the relevant qualifications.
The city definitely wants to keep this function.
If she were no longer able to fill this out, citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But being close to the citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports that there is a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, a number of important projects have accumulated that Wacker looks back on with pride.
&quot;We make the city worth living in,&quot; he says with certainty about the building authority and its employees.
But there will also be a variety of projects on the agenda in the future: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen car park, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the renovation of the stadium is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, &quot;if we do it right,&quot; estimates Wacker.
&quot;All in all, great tasks await my successor.
Working here is fun.&quot;
In terms of design, there is a great deal of leeway for a master builder.
With Haslach&#39;s own building yard and nursery, you can react very flexibly to many things.
&quot;You can do a lot,&quot; says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by residents and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important &quot;to have an eye for what fits in&quot; when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city master builder.
In any case, the city master builder bears a great deal of responsibility.
He is the client, &quot;in the end everything here runs through my desk&quot;.
When it comes to support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.
Wacker also hopes that his successor will stay for a long time: &quot;We&#39;re looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay.&quot;
Because continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further development of the city.
According to the city of Haslach, anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should have a degree in engineering or a bachelor&#39;s degree in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and building planning law.
Building construction and civil engineering, land use planning, land acquisition matters, administration of municipal properties, municipal depot with building yard and municipal gardening department as well as lower building law authority including monument protection are subordinate to the municipal building authority.
Bicycle thrown on lines: southern railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses near the crime scene.
&quot;It goes far beyond a rascal prank,&quot; said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of the rail replacement service, the perpetrators could also face penalties from rail customers.
Overall, a &quot;considerable&quot; sum can be assumed, said the spokesman.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the southern railway line was able to run without hindrances.
Almost ten passenger trains were canceled on Friday morning, two of which affected long-distance traffic.
Freight trains were not cancelled, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and pylons were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate may help alleviate IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease).
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet high in meat-based proteins and dairy products could reduce symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to reduce their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that protein&#39;s essential amino acid, tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol the gut to make sure harmful microbes hiding in food don&#39;t enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.
When the balance tilts too far toward inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell is present in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: &quot;We have made a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.&quot;
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments when the same system is at work in humans.
The postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was studying a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain but housed separately did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice&#39;s gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice&#39;s intestines were DNA-sequenced and six types of bacteria were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells but absent in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and didn&#39;t develop these types of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - minus the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice&#39;s diet, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans the way they do in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: &quot;The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population.&quot;
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a &#39;genius&#39; in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have signed a &#39;genius&#39; in Nemanja Matic, believes Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea&#39;s £40m signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, their last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup kicks off against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper role alongside the likes of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues&#39; pre-season tour of Asia and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he needed to improve before the Premier League season began.
&quot;He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football,&quot; said Mourinho.
&quot;We&#39;ll help him be ready sooner rather than later.&quot;
Alongside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more signings but he insisted the club had already done a &#39;fantastic job&#39; of fulfilling three of their four priority signings.
&quot;To get three out of four, I thank the club for that,&quot; he added.
&quot;I&#39;ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they tried really hard.&quot;
Boeing &quot;paints&quot; Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle, Washington state, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and stretched across the United States in the shape of a Dreamliner, that&#39;s several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
Being on the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had made such advertisements before.
The number &quot;787&quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the tide turns: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain amount of concern before elections.
Just no disruptive fire from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
This has changed fundamentally since Martin Schulz has led the party.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have observed the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even begin to be described with headwind.
They were low blows.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
&quot;This shows once again that Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably,&quot; said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Greens deputy has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state elections, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition.
The Greens federal manager Michael Kellner has asked the renegade Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to give up her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten has to give up her mandate immediately,&quot; said the Greens&#39; federal manager and campaign manager to the editorial network Germany (RND).
&quot;None of this can be true,&quot; sighed an SPD campaigner when the new bad news reached party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without his own governing majority after the Green MP Elke Twesten defected to the CDU.
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland elections in March.
A black eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
That&#39;s what happened - and things got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel staggered the SPD, and the bankruptcy in Dusseldorf knocked the party out.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades struggled to get themselves back on their feet.
Then, when they had just taken heart, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his aura that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication afterwards he did pretty much everything wrong that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been criticized for the VW emissions scandal and his role on the supervisory board.
Lousy poll numbers were added.
Despite this, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more to set accents in the federal government in recent weeks.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not go unnoticed by comrades close to Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so because they hoped Weil would stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Basically, Weil is not to blame for the internal party dispute between the Lower Saxony Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
For the time being, the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and above all at the renegade MP Twesten.
&quot;It is unbearable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten places her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,&quot; says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten was not elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be for her to give up her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, complains about an &quot;undemocratic manoeuvre&quot;.
&quot;The will of the voters was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil prime minister,&quot; says Oppermann, who is leading the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal elections, the RND.
&quot;Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP is distorting the election result,&quot; Oppermann continued.
He asked for the background to be clarified.
I want to know whether there was more or whether there were further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Subsidies for town center III
Anyone who wants to renovate their aging house will soon be able to get support from the state.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
There have been redevelopment areas in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In redevelopment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations so far are a &quot;successful project&quot; - after all, it is important to promote internal development and not just open up new building areas.
On April 4th, information was received from the Regional Council in Karlsruhe that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounts to 833,333 euros, of which 500,000 euros come from the state and the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a redevelopment area created?
According to Schindler, they will investigate where the &quot;really old&quot; houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to be renovated at all.
If necessary, the area boundaries could then be shifted again.
STEG were represented on Wednesday evening by Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal and state program &quot;Social City&quot;, under which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on a property-related basis, i.e. per property.
The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The approval period for the funding runs from January 1, 2017 to April 30, 2026.
However, the inventory would first be carried out by September of this year, in the course of which those involved in the redevelopment area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
If possible, the resolution on the articles of association should be made in November or December so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It&#39;s about evaluating the urban planning deficits and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A redevelopment note will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann would come to Empfingen himself and get an idea of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the &quot;Building and Property Sheet&quot;, which deals with the structural condition and the renovation intentions, among other things.
In the gray questionnaire, the &quot;Household and Housing Form&quot;, information can be given on the size, layout and occupants of a living space.
The blue &quot;operating form&quot; only needs to be filled out if business premises are operated in the building.
However, as Gotzel pointed out, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of the funding works according to the &quot;first come, first served&quot; principle.
Funding cannot be &quot;reserved&quot; for later.
At the end, photos of the &quot;Ortskern II&quot; project were shown to make the renovation &quot;palatable&quot; to those present.
British inventor microchips himself to get into the house and car with a flick of the wrist
A British inventor is the first in the country to be microchipped so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a flick of the wrist.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals looking to simplify their lives with technology through his company, BioTeq.
He has met with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the implant procedure was performed to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam&#39;s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra £300 per lock.
The married father-of-one has now installed technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands
The White House&#39;s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month has cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military data provided to TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House featuring American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office requested the helicopter&#39;s presence in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter is responsible.
&quot;I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual, high-visibility event,&quot; the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the naval deputy commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn around 7am on July 17 for the 3pm event and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6pm and 9pm that evening .
The note adds that if departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty hour restrictions.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while unit security personnel remained with the aircraft during the time on the ground.
It was not clear from the recordings made available to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the regulation.
&quot;One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that it was not,&quot; the commander wrote.
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;re closed off,&quot; replied the second-in-command.
The Made in America event was designated an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President gave an impetus to the reform of health care reform that was underway in the Senate and touted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services amid his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Fla., and his Twitter account is full of stories complaining about his predecessor&#39;s use of the presidential plane.
&quot;The White House is excited about the Made In America show -- showcasing products from all 50 states made by American workers with American materials,&quot; said White House Assistant Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to drop the US President at the White House with precise centimeter readings.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 practice landings in the White House.
The flight for the &quot;Made in America&quot; event counted toward the month&#39;s flight crew training needs, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for &quot;non-presidential support missions.&quot;
The White House said taxpayers didn&#39;t shoulder the burden for any of the other props unveiled at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in displaying the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the Presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the US Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records list the aircraft&#39;s flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility&#39;s home base at Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the true cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
&quot;Setting the cost to taxpayers based on reimbursement rate estimates is highly misleading,&quot; Walters said.
&quot;These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual appropriations.&quot;
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursement rates for DoD do not include labor costs, but do include fuel, maintenance, and contracting costs.
At the time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
&quot;The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week,&quot; Spicer said.
&quot;And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in contributing to our national security and I understand hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we&#39;re all proud of the helicopter and other military hardware that so many Americans worked tirelessly to create.
It is of course appropriate to point that out.&quot;
It wasn&#39;t clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he did get into the driver&#39;s seat of a fire engine.
At the White House, speaking to Sikorsky officials, Trump joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
&quot;I know Sikorsky very well,&quot; said the President, &quot;I have three of them.&quot;
TC BW Neuss facing a tricky task
The leader of the second tennis Bundesliga competes with Suchsdorfer SV, third in the table.
TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will play third-placed Suchsdorfer SV in Kiel tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Despite the still flawless record after five games, the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
In any case, team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
&quot;It&#39;s a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
I think the team is very good, especially in the back positions.&quot;
Above all, the imports from the far north ensure class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV.
&quot;Their Danes and Finns can even refer to appearances in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles,&quot; says Zay, referring to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
&quot;As always, it will be difficult for us.
You also need a good portion of luck.&quot;
The Neuss team for the trip up north is practically ready.
Maxime Janvier could make his debut for Blau-Weiss.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who is playing in the tournament in Liberec in the Czech Republic, will make his first appearance of the season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel yesterday.
But he should be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both from the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins against the Alster club last Sunday, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If there is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from Marius Zay&#39;s coaching staff fills the squad.
How America can damage OMV
Donald Trump didn&#39;t seem really happy when he signed the law tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
&quot;In its haste to enact the law,&quot; Congress packed in a few &quot;unconstitutional provisions,&quot; he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels fumed at the US advance.
After all, the draft provides for penalizing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Since then, investors in the local OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been correspondingly concerned.
The threat is huge.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, according to the oil company&#39;s official statement.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
He has twelve weapons to choose from.
&quot;Die Presse&quot; looked at which ones the group could fend off and which ones could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel takes center stage in Netflix&#39;s hit series
Despite Narcos season 2 revealing Pablo Escobar&#39;s killer, Netflix&#39;s series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, with the first receiving its first trailer and featuring the show&#39;s newest villains.
With season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the wealthiest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate &quot;like a Fortune 500 company&quot; only with more government bribes and violent action.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos Season 3 will begin on September 1st.
Scroll backwards: The city is hiring 46 kitchen helpers
The city organizes the daycare lunch itself again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the municipal day-care centers.
As of September 1st, the city of Krefeld will again take over the food supply in the municipal day-care centers (Kitas) on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the youth welfare department, this is good news: &quot;We were all very happy&quot;.
Cooking will continue to be done off-site: a caterer will take on this task and deliver chilled freshly cooked food.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the last day-care center year, 2,800 children sat at the tables, and the need is constantly growing.
&quot;Meanwhile, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the daycare center,&quot; explains Pommeranz.
&quot;The offer also applies to 35-hour care if the children stay until 2 p.m..&quot;
From September 1st, 46 part-time employees will be on kitchen duty: they heat the food that is delivered, add salad, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, serve the food, clear away, do the dishes and clean the kitchen.
&quot;The employees are permanently assigned to a daycare center,&quot; says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the number of hours.
&quot;The kitchen helpers are now part of the daycare team,&quot; says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
&quot;They are much more involved and it is easier for the daycare management to implement pedagogical concepts&quot;.
Because that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
&quot;The children should help to prepare the food&quot;.
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
&quot;They have a known force in the daycare, a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people&quot;.
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day-care center rooms - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be carried out by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the improvement in the quality of the kitchen service but also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city in a cost comparison between self-management and outsourcing, according to the press office.
And this despite the fact that 46 new part-time employees are being hired.
&quot;But these hours are not that important for around 750 people in the education sector,&quot; says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women&#39;s political role, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run for provincial council elections. Three women are running for the Vice President role and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
&quot;The role of women cannot be overestimated,&quot; he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women fully participate and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with a shift from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will see power peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will enhance Afghanistan&#39;s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered voters out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstrasse, at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to use the girl&#39;s mobile phone to make a call.
The 13-year-old declined the request and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl&#39;s cell phone and necklace, but was unsuccessful.
The duo fled without taking anything.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concerns over investment at McVitie Glasgow factory
A union is seeking assurances from managers at biscuit maker McVitie about their long-term commitment to production at their Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of any investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits, among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives &quot;would be the first to know&quot; if their jobs changed.
In a letter to the company&#39;s store manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie&#39;s to &quot;raise concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being pursued&quot;.
GMB Senior Organizer, Drew Duffy, said: &quot;The fact that we are unable to gain clarity from the General Site Manager on Tollcross&#39; business needs and investment plans for the future deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and Greater Glasgow, a key pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, from a jobs, wages and prosperity perspective, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the east end of Glasgow badly needs a thriving manufacturing presence at McVitie.&quot;
A Pladis spokeswoman said: &quot;The store manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland just yesterday and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the ongoing commitment from staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we continually review our businesses - and this applies to all of our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: &quot;Over the last few years we have invested in excess of £5million at our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross&#39; heritage as a manufacturing facility. Should our operations at the site change, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.&quot;
Did PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won&#39;t back down in their pursuit of Neymar after making a £189m bid to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record heist three years ago?
The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window with the Ligue 1 club poised to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89million last season.
Upon termination, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG are offering wages in excess of £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club have always done their best to establish themselves since arriving from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.
But was the footballing world warned about this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club looking to sign one of PSG&#39;s best players.
&quot;I&#39;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players,&quot; Al-Khelaifi said.
&quot;We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, there will be consequences.&quot;
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italy international to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona were able to feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their prize offers for Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
During the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately knocked over a scooter parked on Königsfelder Strasse in front of property number 30, causing material damage of over 200 euros to the vehicle&#39;s paneling.
The Schramberg police, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car was coming towards him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to swerve and touched the crash barrier.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW around 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the Stolzenau bypass, a car came towards him in his lane, so he had to swerve to the right.
The Touran driver touched the crash barrier.
Property damage was caused to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued driving without paying attention to the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident and the driver of the vehicle responsible to contact the police department in Stolzenau on 05761/92060.
Interview: &quot;Domspatzen report exonerates Pope&#39;s brother Georg Ratzinger&quot;
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse exonerates Pope&#39;s brother Georg Ratzinger.
That is what author and historian Michael Hesemann thinks.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to cause discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the &quot;We are Church&quot; reform movement, told the German Press Agency after the publication that he expected the former Bishop of Regensburg and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral Kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI ., an apology.
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their incorrect assessment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper &quot;Osservatore Romano&quot;, on the other hand, criticized the fact that &quot;double standards&quot; were used when reporting on violence at the cathedral sparrows.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are &quot;disgraceful and shameful acts&quot; that must be punished and prevented in the future; What is striking, however, is the &quot;degree of media manipulation,&quot; according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of Italy&#39;s national bioethics committee.
&quot;The habit of naming the Catholic Church as the source of all ills is part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to accept it as normal,&quot; writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: &quot;People like to go to church and that&#39;s a godsend.&quot;
She also pointed out that in her youth &quot;beatings were a completely normal pedagogical tool&quot; &quot;to deal with cheeky children like me.&quot;
She finds it unfair to apply today&#39;s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the cases of abuse, Pope&#39;s brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial volume &quot;My Brother the Pope&quot; with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
&quot;I have to protect Georg Ratzinger,&quot; says Hesemann, &quot;because none of that had anything to do with him,&quot; he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg to investigate?
Between 1945 and the early 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were victims of assaults &quot;with a high degree of plausibility&quot;, and 67 cathedral sparrows were sexually abused.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: &quot;In summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
The punishment for the pupils could also be more severe, especially in the case of high emotionality.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other suspects, it is striking that many victims appreciated R.&#39;s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence&quot;.
In an interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the &quot;incidents of violence against those in charge of the Regensburg cathedral sparrows&quot; gives a contradictory picture of cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students emphasize his &quot;humanity.&quot;
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became violent when a cathedral sparrow did not perform top musically.
As his biographer, how do you rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble to read the entire 440-page report from cover to cover, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.
Just eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly cleared of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violent excesses at the pre-school also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.
At most, one can accuse him of finding out about it too late or not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - literally - &quot;redemption&quot;, &quot;heaven&quot; and &quot;a better world&quot;.
The vast majority of his students gave Georg Ratzinger excellent marks, describing him as &quot;warm-hearted&quot;, &quot;popular&quot;, &quot;sincere&quot;, &quot;competent&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot;, as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly served the boys with cake , biscuits and sweets and was &quot;always surrounded by bunches of children&quot;.
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has sometimes led to outbursts of anger.
Years ago he admitted that he not only banged chairs and threw the bunch of keys on the floor, but also slapped the ears and pulled the hair or ears of overly cheeky boys, deeply regretting it and apologizing for it.
To his credit, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents and teachers alike.
Do you also know such chastisement methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violent excesses in preschool, these are of course trifles.
One wonders if it&#39;s not more about his fame and his role as Benedict XVI&#39;s brother. has to do with the fact that a lot of the media just rushed at him.
Many who never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: The report exonerates Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In connection with the report, the media reported a great deal about the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Definitely no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral conductor.
Not even the parents were in the know.
&quot;I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it,&quot; said one affected person on behalf of the others, &quot;It was all very embarrassing for me.&quot;
The real problem with investigating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent out of shame.
If they didn&#39;t even confide in their parents and siblings, then certainly not in a choir director, who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators, so to speak.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger&#39;s role with regard to the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student who was interviewed put it like this: &quot;Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he of all people (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator in question.
I think it&#39;s ... also really absurd to assume that boys of all people opened up to him more urgently or clearly or earlier than to their parents, boarding school directors, tutors, etc.
Talking to him about sex... - unthinkable.&quot;
The report comes to the very clear conclusion: &quot;The fact that the affected students and/or their environment confided in him beforehand could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation&quot;.
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must be acquitted of any complicity.
So he cannot be accused of not having prevented or reported him.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as unfortunately has happened in some cases.
There was a lot to be read in the media about &quot;violent excesses&quot; at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger is accused of &quot;looking away&quot; in the report.
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That&#39;s the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that in turn is an abuse of the report.
Because there is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let&#39;s say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible spanking pedagogy, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered terribly as a result, all happened at the preschools in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
As the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the subject of &quot;preschool&quot; was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped it and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot;paradise&quot; conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline there, but no sadistic violence.
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger, for whom the report comes to the conclusion that &quot;many victims appreciated R.&#39;s general humanity and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence&quot;.
The only thing that remains is the accusation of having looked the other way.
But despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two time periods in which he was told about the conditions in the preschool.
The first time was in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and (according to the witness) did not want to hear anything about what was happening at a school where he was not active or responsible, and then again only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently turn a blind eye to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it he points out &quot;that caning will continue to be practiced in the pre-school&quot;.
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
That was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when corporal punishment had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they happened in a legal gray area, as any of us probably remember.
It was also difficult for him to assess where those affected might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can&#39;t say he always looked the other way.
That&#39;s just not true.
In 1980, caning in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today&#39;s pedagogical standards to that time.
How do you see it?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the &quot;pitfall of anachronism&quot;, i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today&#39;s moral standards.
The princess is right about that.
But of course that doesn&#39;t apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also doesn&#39;t apply to the atrocities and violence committed against innocent children&#39;s souls in preschool, that goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
It&#39;s all awful and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s finally being worked through.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because none of this had anything to do with him.
His methods of discipline and punishment, such as slapping, hair and ear pulling, were widespread in the 1970s.
When corporal punishment was outlawed, he strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book &quot;My Brother the Pope&quot;?
Did the subject of corporal punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, where the cathedral sparrows only played a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I am by no means concealing the fact that he led a strict regime there.
But it also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to create a world-class institution out of the Regensburger Domspatzen, which until then had been more nationally known, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
Biscuits and sweets alone don&#39;t make great singers out of stubborn boys, and before any success, no matter in which area, there is always discipline, passion and self-control.
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger as when talking about your book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and I have always experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally kind, deeply religious and kind-hearted person, of whom one cannot imagine that he was even one could harm a fly.
I regularly see how many former cathedral sparrows still keep in regular contact with him, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who still don&#39;t forgive him for being harsh on them are clearly in the minority.
Today, most cathedral sparrows are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable person of respect who they still look up to today and who they downright adore.
And please, once again very clearly: everything he is accused of is educational methods that were the order of the day at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published exonerates him.
Now decency would dictate that a 93-year-old man, who has done a great job and without whom no one outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, would finally be left in peace.
