Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lacking will in the peace process.
Obama's promotion of the deal over Iran's nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, who had refused a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon told Lamb in a somewhat shaky voice to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
It was important for Lamb to stress that his "cute dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white notepad: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was stated in the letter, according to the authorities, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the fateful emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: lamb took his own life when the police surrounded him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses taught by both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies towards problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the PhD, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to that house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work in 2009 at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 people, and taught geography and education.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her to play guitar for a few years.
He was the heartthrob back then.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolute best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both performing at a summer fair three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica in front of a sparse crowd.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, ran the freshman seminar program, specializing in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial service Tuesday night.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamm referred to Prentiss as his wife in his distress call, there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't be hiring as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give its current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin interviews this month and the headcount will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the holiday season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and I'm starting to realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it occurs to me that I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg said, "it's indisputably the greatest time-travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterates its call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the Council's five permanent member nations — the US, Russia, China, Britain and France — on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in managing the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top ranks in the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading by double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the parliamentary term.
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's staying power and are beginning to pour their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite, became the nominee.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post said Monday.
The same number is true in the nation's first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Despite this, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to do his job effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
Still, a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributing to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is garnering majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a neck-and-neck race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have firmly cast their votes.
Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they are leaving the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competition right now is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've formed their minds are twice as likely to favor Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the linchpin of public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will keep key Hispanics away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday's new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump apparently will.
Frustration with the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry."
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea mudflats.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched-roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student dormitory in Munich is not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top places of residence, however, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square meter at dizzying heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But well, who can afford it ...
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goal scorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it worked.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to their "Milan mission" in the cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League at the Greek record champions Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double (52./90.+2) and Götze's goal (89.) deservedly with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start success in a row should be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich at the third attempt.
Müller received the kind help of Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto on his 28th goal in the Champions League to give Bayern the lead, who let a shot intended as a flank by the world champion pass.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining.
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his cross from the right half-field hit the upper left corner of the goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion awarded the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half one.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the Pole's header off the line (26th).
Then by direct acceptance, which goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35.).
Although Bayern played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set pinpricks.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer could be relied upon.
For example, when he deflected a shot from Ideye over the bar (56.).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a back four defended with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat out.
The World Cup hero had given the green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to make something different out of it, that's already malicious".
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change when he brought Kingsley Coman for the ailing Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, with a penalty Müller added one more.
Before the game, there had been riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially masked Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and transported out of the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: If you do without it, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to sink back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham in England.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing from DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by edentulism, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study substantiates the findings.
Archaeologists come across remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always consulted as a specialist office for archaeological monument preservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists have now found what they are looking for.
It was already known from text documents that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman hit by freight train
After a young woman has an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks coming from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was hit by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she has suffered serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She received emergency medical treatment on site and was taken to hospital by rescue workers.
About the reason of the nocturnal track crossing of the young woman, the investigating officers have no information.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information that provides information about the cause of the accident can be given under the round-the-clock and free hotline of the Federal Police under telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds significantly to traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would make it possible to appeal judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she says she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be resolved.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS), which are mainly demanded by large corporations, are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can fight for damages at the expense of taxpayers, overturn national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
Above all, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a great step forward.
In the reform, the Commission is taking into account key points that Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of action of the economy by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA.
Originally, a framework for the agreement was to be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer tenable.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at Cologne's Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Steven's lecture.
Using various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, he tells what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs tell about.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear, which nestle harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" is the first part of a daring series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung about in a row.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has already been released and positively breaks certain expectations.
Stevens appears reduced here.
Live guitar and banjo are enough for him.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a widely acclaimed masterpiece was released in 2005.
Exuberant of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic set pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and reverb.
Long since emerged from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark Hamburg More!
Theatre, he mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2000 guests now sit spellbound in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays their way through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience one hears: The lecture is "more opulent" and you can "basically throw away the record".
Only at an encore Stevens modestly thanks him, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and take on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be scrutinised by the media and closely tested by Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent while singing the national anthem at a 75th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two Newsnight that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences on business, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also "piling up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on his position on the European Union and limiting profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was putting forward amendments to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow employment and pensions minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron across the dispatch box in Parliament over the last decade since becoming Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "quick-wittedness" and barbed arguments, and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will replace him if he does not attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also floated the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor and that he has approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from "puppet theatre" politics, often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
First televised in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister has been seen as the main barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary counterparts, despite critics arguing that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reform.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a tough place to go if you're homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and make a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound jumped on data indicating an increase in UK wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and July, profit excluding bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and climbed 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed up 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the standout stock on the market, jumping 20% after receiving a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
One transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher on encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it raised $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares of packaging and paper giant Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1% after reporting half-year pre-tax profit of $46.6 million.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages threaten expansion.
JD Sports managing director Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it's unlikely that purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
A paltry 21 years young, a hanger with a chic hairstyle.
The guy with the platinum blond hair is worth 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin's luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: This is where her idol, whose posters hang in abundance in Szczecin, has been living since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much per day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says: "Actually, my Viktoria should be in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling a dream for her."
Compulsory education?
Who's itching?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
He has taken care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the commercial break of the Super Bowl he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also cashes in.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you marvel at the window.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million in this way.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is just in the US and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least that's what he does.
Pegida poster gives Lebanese potato kebab idea
Potatoes or kebab?
You can do both - in the potato kebab developed by the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the slogan "Potato instead of kebab" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
He got the idea from a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of kebab", which he had seen by chance on television.
Since then, a barbecue skewer stocked with meat and potatoes has been spinning in his shop.
"This is multiculturalism for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered the idea with the patent office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model there.
Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just this much: "It tastes even better together," he says.
The culinary understanding between the nations is also well received by his customers.
Metcash launches down-to-earth campaign to combat Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earth campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands like Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo handing out samples at IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler holds its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high, as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores, generating higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first stores, Aldi will snatch away about five percent of the grocery market in these two states and take sales away from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and groceries business and volumes on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash's food and grocery revenue to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash was likely to arrive within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is believed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery trade, which serves about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging while putting pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to match selling prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, improving IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster-growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private-label foods.
Metcash's chief executive Ian Morrice says price adjustments and store redevelopment programs will gain momentum and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is joined by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour, according to Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo often referred to as "Special Ks," was thrust into the spotlight by Kyrgios' infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat the kid."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a cramp thwarted a potential US Open victory for Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn into the argument a little bit," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost to the US Open due to a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the locker room, he's training hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think  he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important preliminaries, which starts on Friday, and he describes the 'joint decision' as the right thing for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick made it to the top very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time away from the limelight, where he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone who tried to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and set up tents and settled there.
But frustrations mounted.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some turned back food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in surprised Italy and Greece. They expressed hope that an agreement would eventually be reached next month or by the end of the year that EU states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on an early action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country — after ending a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arrivals are economic migrants in search of a better life, rather than war refugees entitled to protection – a view that is at stark odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) fence the government built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to procedurally approve the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's country security adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car with barbed wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pressed a crowd to squeeze in.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would deny food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, will receive support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the primaries begin, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say their opinion is fixed on which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have diminished.
Their support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by double-digit Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead over that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton — only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say so about their frontrunner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open-ended question why they want her to be the nominee, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval of the handling of the problems and eligibility are also cited.
With the vice president throwing potential for president in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want him in the race — even though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is in the lead.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is by far second in that measurement, but the percentage that considers him the "most electable" has risen.
Still, when asked what is more important about a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, perform well on some important characteristics among voters in their party's primaries.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities.
Biden scores best on honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters generally also see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically aligned with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server continue to be asked during her tenure as secretary of state, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter, saying it hasn't affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their overall opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider her an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get high marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best on honesty.
A majority views Sanders as honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves close behind Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of voters' support in the new poll, and others are dramatically losing support.
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support is growing by 27% in Tuesday's poll, from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month.
But Carson shot up from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson resonates well with demographic groups, outperforming Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is trailing with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson rising in the polls — landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side blows for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people no longer go into the sea: A maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to be offered by the Mediterranean: In the east, it even comes up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees at the peak, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a student died during a fraternity vexatious ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are being filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to walk across a frozen field toward a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta psi brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood's national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be resuscitated, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted blunt force injuries to his head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's harassment. At least one student dies from harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A county grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with bullying attacks and forming a criminal organization.
"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this — officially or unofficially — we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the chapter.
That's what will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
A rate hike is coming, and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will all take and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for business.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
This is why representatives of the US Federal Reserve have insisted so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts raising interest rates, but rather on the time it takes to normalize.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement about a rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal levels, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here's a look based on historical trends at how some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset gains to be strangled 12 to 24 months after the initial hike, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed rate hikes.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has mostly been on an uptrend – about 14 percent – on the way to raising rates, quite flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis.  which Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the rise cycle and returns start to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Most remarkably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point if the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP has been below 4.5 percent only twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, expecting only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes have been on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all cycles of increase from 1950 to today have occurred in a super-cycle of increasing momentum in GDP, dwarfing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect is faster with bonds than with equities when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction once the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to move closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, although "we're still cautious about expecting higher returns," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in an analysis.
What's interesting, Jones says, is that markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has risen – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that do more of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debt.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed companies with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their equities also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the channel for its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated The Brits.
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" into Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament, increasing new pressure on the broadcaster to prove it is doing something the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was "dumbing down" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems — I don't like to use the word 'dumb down' — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, seem to be The Brits just under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it came to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and music-making that's truly second to none.
"And I think Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it needed to work harder to engage audiences than it has done in the past because Brits are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for stepping on the toes of its commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - be produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wished the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it launched an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee payers on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowest in August and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000.
Online sales boosted three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday in November has curbed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with just five percent year-on-year increase.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales picked up three years ago when shoppers started shopping with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that's leveling off, and we may see growth slow.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that shoppers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers rallied around their computers to get their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which shoppers fought each other for bargains, could deter shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spending, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in city centers.
Muslims bury those killed in crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse in part on the giant Saudi bin Laden group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's grand mosque.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead began their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the holy site, where only days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto those praying.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family's construction company for the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed when a crane crashed through Mecca's Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane standing when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree issued by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not report this detail, but said the company's leadership was banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered ahead of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The bin Laden group did not issue any statements about de Kran's collapse, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for failing to implement safety measures and failing to cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and undertakes major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was dispossessed by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of those killed and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the days of cheap Eastern European artisans are over
Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind it
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at artisans will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen to carry out the work in their homes.
If you are skillful with a hammer or brush for painting walls, you seem to belong to a minority these days.
Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen to do DIY jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the DIY chain, said a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices is now outdated.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at artisans and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q shops, because eight out of ten in-store purchasing decisions are made by women.
At the moment, men predominate among the employees.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends, which have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards equilibrium.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of a UK FTSE100 listed leader, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 percent of its team staffed by women, including its executive and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials on trial for embezzlement
At the Regional Court of Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball runner-up Aich / Dob had to answer for embezzlement and tax evasion.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to senior prosecutor Robert Riffel, it had emerged in the preliminary investigation that the defendants used funds from association accounts, through which they were allowed to dispose in their functions, for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offenses.
This fact was ruled out by the chairwoman of the jury senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
With regard to the rejection of embezzlement, the defence explained that the club had never suffered a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials had only charged expense allowances and led the sports club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 schillings (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Do we continue to run the club or do we lock up?" said one of the defendants, a major auditor of the tax office.
Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We have advanced money, put our life insurance policies as collateral at the bank," he said during the interrogation.
It had been agreed with the association: You can manage the money freely, but no debts may be made.
Furthermore, with corresponding financial success, the payment of the expense allowances had been decided retroactively to 1991.
Therefore, part of the expense allowances were paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus in the account.
Therefore, lump-sum and not detailed debits appeared, explained the former chairman.
The accounts and passbooks were managed jointly by the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the financial management in detail, only the freedom from debt was important, so the answer.
When investigations for abuse of office began against one functionary in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association's account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran in the name of the second defendant and, according to his testimony, was not known to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
For a long time, the respondent did not know the answer.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor said.
The co-defendant had been informed, the functionary justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "compensation for damages".
Why compensation for damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he had disagreed with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says: "You're all off the hook with that".
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the functionary said that he had never received a cent of salary, he had only charged mileage money and diets.
In diets, he had charged the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not produce exact documents for the early years.
These were no longer kept after a tax audit in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received mileage allowance.
All repairs were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The trial will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reductions that have been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will cut further jobs as the company splits.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not ending.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This should save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
HP employed approximately 302,000 people at the end of fiscal year 2013/14.
Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 percent after the stock market.
The group from Palo Alto, California, which grew up with printers, is currently splitting up: The computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently hit the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third fiscal quarter to the end of July, PC and printer sales fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.4 billion dollars.
As a result, revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has been late in reacting to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans envisage a total of around 55,000 job cuts.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq, however, would meet with overwhelming rejection: 54 percent were against it, 35 percent were in agreement.
The fact that other countries are carrying out air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is positive for 61 percent.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
51 percent of respondents reject cooperation with Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, while 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
Until 27 September, the trade fair will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electromobility.
After two days of pressing, Chancellor Angela Merkel will celebrate her 66th birthday. International motor show under the motto "Mobility connects" officially opened on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday onwards.
As two years ago, the organisers of the German Automobile Association (VDA) are expecting around 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the policemen was a water cannon ready.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers.
The officers initially used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that just over half who thought the Fed would do so as recently as last week now think the Fed will hold on a little longer, keeping interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to ZERO.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may exit zero and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is performing relatively well, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
It has warned markets to brace themselves for an increase, but signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
Delta State University Shooter Left Letter of Apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished "he could undo it," authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, an associate professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. Monday morning.
And said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center employee that police needed to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house, but "will not disturb anyone" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentiss was described as a "good person" by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "devastated."
He said that Prentiss were her daughter "absolute best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with one shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his lifetime on the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also allegedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa restructures the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with better organization alone.
The restructuring of the Group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs.
Meanwhile, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is restructuring its corporate structure and upgrading its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board member for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the Management Board team led by CEO Carsten Spohr.
With the realignment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organization of the 120,000-employee company was complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which accounts for three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining dispute with the pilots' association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the strike was stopped by the courts.
This was announced by the union.
The topic of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible "in a year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision for pilots, the background is the "Wings" savings concept.
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to the Group's own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw unable to play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this has left the left full-back crying and will ban him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very hard time and then plays fantastic, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my road to recovery starts now, I come back stronger."
Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the pitch with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while Mexico played Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's having a hard time because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction so it looked like it [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a Chris Smalling foul.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare provider to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I love to read to my children because there always seems to be a picture or message we've missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a synopsis of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand on the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," it reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes  to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment being devastated by the greedy, tree-felling, thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, mustachioed creature "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but made no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Facing Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but when you see the squad England have chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won't carry any scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at test level, is an option for attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth leaves the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because -- and I said this before -- players are their own best selectors.
Long ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he hopefully beats more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he didn't perform so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to make his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at his best - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman I highly value.
He's an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us hard.
He must be given at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat alongside Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batsman can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a devil of cricketers.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county of Worcestershire, but he's a No. 3 for them, and there's not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He hit three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up weirdo, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me a lot as a young man.
People may look at his stats — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and think it's a punt, but there aren't a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England have made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort to the setup.
I always felt that he was made for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Colly's team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not play for the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some may not agree, but coaches and team rosters don't set the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK's exit from the EU) could gain popularity if the economy falls into the doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each passing day, even without the brilliant Jeremy's choice, "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, which fell out over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is, and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-imposed agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly don't want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that they also don't like it when they threaten social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain looking outside inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously level-headed chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the excessively long perseverances like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is looking ahead to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine that they will rip out a leg to help the selfie British, whose energy would be better spent trying to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
As a result, some such ministers may even be deliberately planning unhelpful remarks, SNP-style, during Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what Eurosceptics the oligarchy of press barons is, but they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
You can faintly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU straight banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly of them, but found that if you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, it's better to hand out bananas to distract him than to become his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum whirlwind, because Blair had put principle above the EU's failed constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door for him.
The press has never forgiven him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I put it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-dye tendency and the wilder realms of Tory's Little Englishism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" told Benn on radio and television this week, as the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's when his old father tried on TV to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay "under all circumstances" — Benn's expression — was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow campaigners and MPs, according to all reports, at their retreat Monday night.
Whatever Corbyn's sentimental bottom-up image wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that allows him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO – Tom Watson is adamantly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find meaning in everything for their superiors at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, when all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "policy report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the validity of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said he was receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the panel's members are not provided, but that includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco management.
The group's research "tellingly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the harms of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said BMJ's claims had already been responded to earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it doesn't, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
BBC should abandon EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public service programmes, which are likely to be seen by smaller audiences, in highly controversial time slots against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director-general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea of BBC commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the BBC's future.
If you want to keep the licence fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least base your production on programmes that others do not make or commission.
They broadcast The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax finances programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes reflect what former Sky head Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more niche public service programmes "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion in licence fees, 'Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody has seen.'
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions as to who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think, that for £150 a year you get a lot of value here, but for people who is a lot of money for the £150, I wonder if that's true because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of the BBC's production was now officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio – and it should follow the example of public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, where he said only a handful are shown on television, and form alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that are too high for human hearing to hear.
The pulses work by turning on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses to people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he discovered, amplify the ultrasonic waves that then enter the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are associated, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Fair video.
Horrible killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg ties!
Cluster bombs!
And electric batons, which cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms show is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to shine a spotlight on the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Will you be travelling with DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London, using "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of Allen keys claimed to "gain access to around a third of bus stop advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to go outside into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the gun show promotion — through a blank space on the ExCeL calendar — and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertisement, but "by instilling with bright colors and animation, it sticks more strongly."
"They have done a fantastic job helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the show," said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is intervention by the British Government and a guarantee that torture devices are not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a U.S. Army order for "the shoulder-shot AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-oblivious 19-year-old, I moved into a dormitory, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I teased — and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student dormitories ranges from mildly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to chat: people tell where you're from, if and where you took a sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you "honestly don't love or hate Marmite because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes caught fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People's rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues and communal hangouts, but they are also the places where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
In terms of this: Don't think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room strolling culture that is friendly, social, and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to walk away so that I can get back the energy I used up interacting with you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted from socializing - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Making friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of baking mania, knocking on people's doors to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies is less strange than greeting the 1950s. So, now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to entertain themselves and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, stealing chicken is a theft, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are, they'll say they're serving themselves, even if they're cooking inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy — but try to be more balanced than my roommate who added a dish soap to her milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that prevents people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the word, one of those people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind turning down the drum & bass a bit, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before blaring her own music, locking her door, and heading to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student dormitory?
Conversely, wouldn't it be profoundly embarrassing if you mistake a roommate for your future spouse, get close to her, separate again and then have to see her every day and perhaps see her pull all their mutual friends over to you?
Of course, the heart goes its own way — but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk your abdomen into a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between a joke and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments for it to boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding – but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not pin your possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in Eckental in Middle Franconia for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: In one project, he is building terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will enter the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because the people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the influx of refugees, we will also need sufficient living space in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have building codes complicated their plans?
Gildner: In terms of building law, I carried out my project correctly.
Particularly complicated always makes it the threatening sword of Damocles special construction and the parking space ordinance.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities there is no space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to your terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren't you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It's true that we've had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that even ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message stating that the "Software Update Failed".
To work around the issue, users are advised to either wait for the rush to recede or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
That could potentially mean deleting apps to free up space — but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It's worth making sure your phone is charged or near a charger during the update so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could cause the update to be canceled.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protect yourself in case they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for iPad, as well as changes that speed up and fix the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
In the fight for the Formula 1 World Championship title against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg knows only one motto: "Full attack".
Before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, the World Championship runner-up emphasised "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the runner-up from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton before the night race in Singapore this Sunday.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also tackling the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state as the favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for a cure.
Gauselmann is a bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which was accepted by chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
District office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift retirement centre have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation is drawn down from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely, to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and those seeking advice can now receive information on questions such as long-term care insurance or health and long-term care insurance benefits.
For years, we have noticed with our outpatient nursing service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Also, it is not uncommon for many services of the funds not to be used, because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood," explained the new landlady Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus" as head of the geriatric care division.
In addition to consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapy treatment.
The offers of the senior center and the Saludis complement each other perfectly.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The senior center for care and care," described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre in particular in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration ceremonies, the district office is also dedicated to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social get-together".
In this way, the social foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 noon.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-division club Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, October 6 has now been set as the date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the second round of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third division FC Würzburger Kickers has now finally been scheduled.
The game will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 7 p.m. in Bamberg's Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are glad that we now know when the game will take place, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket sales that have now started.
It's something special for our team to play against a third-division team.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlit plays have a special charm.
FC Eintracht Bamberg reached the round of 16 in 2010 with victories at 1 FC Oberhaid (3-1) and at home against regional league side 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3-2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
SpVgg Unterhaching are the defending champions.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, has died.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as the press release put it.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann.
From 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 80s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking fine: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has attracted attention in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a footballer.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not increased.
Wiese was getting his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking guard issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the official and threw the fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reported.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rainforest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for marijuana plants to thrive.
For three days, the Panamanian authorities have been uprooting and burning the 4500 plants.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters, according to police, and shouted to them that they should wait for him.
At this time, the group was at the height of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the grounds of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the teenager and punched him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and bled heavily from his nose.
When his two friends rushed over and appeased the thug, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man has now been brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and demonstratively drove past there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim's face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Joint municipality mayor Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
In many places in the countryside there is a lack of doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice there on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will support his successor with half a job in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then he invests 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and also wants to join the practice next year.
"We always had in the back of our minds that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When the time came, I just called her."
The Müllers liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees it as an advantage to soon be his own boss.
And so it was agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller, father of two, also grew up there, and his medical studies in Hanover were followed by positions in several medical practices and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He currently works as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and volunteers in the DRK readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to establish themselves as family doctors.
"That's why endoscopy comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need one more consultation room.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Joint Community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," emphasizes Joint Community Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, compared to about 500 in the average practice in northern Germany.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller's takeover of the practice: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy will remain in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have left.
Incidentally, those who attend Müller's consultation hours continue to look into familiar faces: take over the seven medical assistants and the cleaner from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning, we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers with a smile.
She already feels a little melancholy after a long time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6,000-square-meter property."
"So far, I've always shied away from gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also being ramped up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
At the same time, controls at the Hungarian border remain in place.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The supply and security of the people are in the foreground.
But it is also clear "that clear signals are needed," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
A controlled approach is needed.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also build corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see it quite that way in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister emphasized, Slovenian does not want to seal off its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia past the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours of Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "We can neither nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected in the course of the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometers away, through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary had closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the postponement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, to a slightly further westerly route.
Croatia: "Comprehensive border control capabilities"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "extensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, and since then its EU partners have consistently given the country good marks in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning during a local inspection in Horgos: He considered the debates on alternative routes for refugees, now that the Hungarian border is closed, to be premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aid workers advise migrants to take - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger: 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still uncleared minefields in parts of the border area.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of deminers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The captured information is said to have been used to make insider trading on the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of over $ 100 million was stolen.
"Today's settlement shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught," the SEC statement said.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the USA and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around Mannheim's Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
The people do their errands, sometimes fast, partly leisurely strolling.
You head for the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Light rail stop.
Vibrant, full life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large panels each with the heading "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The director of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions, as are the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously grab the chalk and add "affirm my life", "be able to read", "drive through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "do not suffer for long", others stop for a moment, read, say sentences such as "I'm not that far yet" and then move on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site at the moment.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is responsible for the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this publicity campaign for the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and dying is still fraught with taboos, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement in particular has contributed a lot in recent years to opening up people.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and bereavement counsellor has been one of the first volunteers.
Confronted with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was looking for volunteers, she got in touch immediately and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany sufferers and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the hospice Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is good at dealing with her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see life from a different perspective, consider it precious and cherish the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further education and supervision of the death and bereavement counselors.
Training courses for new employees are offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial outlook for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its full-year profit outlook due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The firm also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that it plans to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. said it earned a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than its earlier forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite price increases, which average 4.9 percent and take effect on Jan. 4, and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large parcels that will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online retail.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is "delivering solid earnings considering weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
For the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent year-over-year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just short of the $2.44 per share forecast by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
Last quarter, ground transportation revenue increased 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with an 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide if it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming above them at one end of the ornate, two-story boardroom is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests before anything else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to wean off the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most data shows the economy growing solidly, recent turmoil in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials anxious about adding to that volatility by raising the Bunds interest rate, even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait and see, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of a hike.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless strategists soften the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy would maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates at this point," he said.
If it does, "it would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small move in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation has consistently been below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tightness in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world flinched late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in China's economy would curb global growth.
The market has rebounded somewhat this month, with the Dow now down nearly 10% from its May high.
For Fed officials, the market turmoil is influencing the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If it weren't for the events in financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, they would be tightening the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at UCLA's Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and there's almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making.
But in effect, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
Then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's mere suggestion in 2013 that the Fed could "tighten" its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited discernible impact on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only put financial stability issues first during a major crisis like the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Interest Rate Setting Committee.
The recent turmoil is not coming close to that level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where it's afraid of a rate hike because markets are upset," said Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think it should be ahead of time.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a bewildering number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and tableware, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There's even an auto department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food stall (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit, and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it for you if desired.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork natural casing, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, even individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping trolleys and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the cash register.
Where it's located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown -- a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is busy, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Kleine Lebenshilfe for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving them a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who selflessly support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
Even with her 74 Lenzen, she still enjoys teaching.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seekers' home on Dillinger Straße.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different teaching than at a real school.
Brazil's pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during lactation. She does this by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake isn't the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects their babies' genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The municipal council of Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gym construction at the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the most recent municipal council meeting, the developed building application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the committee had decided, among other things, an application for an "exception" or "exemption" from the valid development plan under building law.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "gable roof with non-central ridge and roof overhang" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof," explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof pitch, which for energy reasons - contrary to what is prescribed in the development plan - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An "exemption" was necessary because the development plan does not allow any "exceptions" with regard to the roof pitch - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively when applying for exemption.
However, the construction of the gymnasium is not a recurring project: "We are not setting a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gym construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Costs of around 2.3 million euros have been factored in.
Subsidies are expected from the promotion of schools and popular sports.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the district office for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new Medical Director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is provided for by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, the district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision will be made by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, 23 September.
Should the plans be implemented, then all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Innere Station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot travel to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play when asked who should succeed him, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and move to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrade" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological diseases in the internal ward.
On an interim basis for the next two years, Fischer and his team will lead both hospitals, if the supervisory board agrees, until next year the former hospital of the Knappschaft, which still has 35 beds, in Peißenberg is to be finally closed after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital Weilheim is completed.
District Administrator Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board, countered rumours that the house, which is owned by the Federal Miners' Association, will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
"I rule that out." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say, there are several considerations.
Currently, a short-term care of Caritas and a day psychiatry are accommodated there.
"Nothing better could have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the quasi-move to the Lech, which was received "positively and very understandingly" by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house, where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He had been asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg hospital (once 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (20.15 clock) at the Bergischer HC.
The Bundesliga leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Baden team suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvesting on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg district), several hunters were in use, as the police announced.
After a shot was fired, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could come to the accident, was initially unclear.
The criminal investigation department is investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of the since Saturday missing 16-Year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate.
During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenager and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
A suspect is a 20-year-old, who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who confessed to the crime and led investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed the evening before after visiting an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first came across personal belongings of the victim.
During interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspicion finally arose against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted in police interrogation that he had killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-Year-old should be presented on Wednesday to the magistrate, the investigators put him manslaughter to the charge.
Information about the circumstances of the crime should bring the further investigation.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association alliance "Social Housing".
By way of comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial reception centre.
Many then come across the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers rented accommodation last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also identifies significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit in front of it, which is getting bigger from year to year.
Currently, around 770,000 residential units are already missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many working people in large cities were therefore forced to live in shared rooms.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the lull on the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance for Social Housing is proposing a fresh start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing again.
For example, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized apartments could be temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The subsidy programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees have safe passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
It is practically impossible to get through to Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing the route via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow passage via Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
But the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After sealing off the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people had come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic declared: "You can pass through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who live and want to achieve something.
However, they are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees in the morning at the border of Serbia to the EU neighboring country Croatia.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and taxis.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to cross the green border into Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
But the border strip holds other dangers: There are still live mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 90s.
Deminers should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, however, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 apprehended people.
Shortly before closing time on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing Röszke.
Among the applicants were 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, only a few refugees reach Austria.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting to continue their journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees, Wernstein was the end for them," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau.
Before that, we first fed the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks.
We immediately said that we would take them to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN interview.
They were very grateful.
A man did not miss the opportunity to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased about that," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had changed on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train to Passau, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been suspended.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border issues are generally very popular.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday sociable, the day before a Zweibrückenlauf sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to set up structures in the Röszke camp that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly placed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees, too, will find that the "promised land" that invited and welcomed them is nothing but another refugee camp.
In view of the continuing streams of refugees and the approaching winter, it will be a great challenge to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word carrying weight.
The government has appointed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got the chaos in the initial reception centre Traiskirchen under control.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also carried out without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a bottomless pit," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the provincial governors.
They had assured him that they would also provide accommodation for the coming refugees.
"Things are going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP representative supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, where it will be clarified how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also has high expectations of the ORF campaign "Help like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of need, it could not be that accommodation providers have to comply with a certain height of the towel rails or size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
Konrad justifies the fact that, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the untruth to his face.
Persuasiveness is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur any costs for the Republic, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The company's own search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container as an office on Stephansplatz.
But there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as those affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In case of emergency, however, further locations are to be tested for their suitability.
The city boss criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Borders will not be sealed"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on the further course of action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
For the time being, there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neue Werft" in Linz's Industriezeile has been officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the bright minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies of the Neue Werft and later acquiring some.
Right from the start, S&T wants to cooperate with its new neighbours - and Niederhauser expects a lot from this: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested 1.7 million euros in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, one third of which is owned by the City of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt arcade had to postpone this project without further ado: After all, she has now grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the brand Furla, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks had been rebuilt.
"But I thought long and hard about whether I should open another store," says Breit.
One of the decisive factors for the decision was that the Furla producers, who are based in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Breit was born with an interest in fashion from her mother.
I like it the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women fall into rapture at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert can not answer with absolute certainty.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag enhances any outfit.
The Brulljes maker from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called show-offs.
Some also associate this characteristic with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses xenophobia, rudely approaches journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency stirs up the election campaign.
And does well at it.
This is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is known to many in the winegrowing village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is related to him over umpteen corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in election campaign mode.
Simone Wendel from Kallstadt made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it somehow exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt way," says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, she has made an amusing documentary about the town and its famous offspring, including Trump and the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not make it to the King of Hearts there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to be the opinion that Trump is "a bit of a loudmouth," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the area is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of show-offs.
The Trumpian success story began in 1885, when the future grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the USA.
The cornerstone of the real estate group were the first land purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return home permanently failed because of the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he had once run away without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatine History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared at the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This stands in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way he rumbles, it's not so likeable," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandma was born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distantly, "he is always so quick-tempered".
Does he think Trump will come?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt."
The innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She thinks it would be better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have gotten there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will ripen even without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has been seen by 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also arousing in the USA.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountaineering villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the local Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are rushing to Canberra to report following the loss of Liberal leadership, but it hasn't caused any major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show aired from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull toppled Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, starring presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows that included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That drawback of the gap didn't seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase from Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000) ratings, but its number fell short of last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for reviewing!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words starring former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a resounding "yes".
Seven's X-Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia attracted 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The drop in ratings on The Chase Australia's second night will give Nine confidence that Hot-Seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30pm.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute that failed to surpass the McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood finally ends up in The Bachelor has been shrouded in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three turn two, you may have accidentally given a clue as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's finale
All three women lyrically talked about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the spoilsport of who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were both quick to name Mackay as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has both feet on the ground, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her perspective, Mackay said last week's home visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game – I'm now unreservedly attuned to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should vote for, if not her, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will air on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US – and there were plenty of other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open day of training late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have relegated Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true colours in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-match press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his botched catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne misses a punt that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was one thing that happens, you just care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian tarmac.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, seized, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters demand the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and parliamentary group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn retreat in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are not corresponding new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will get upheavals in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of the Free Voters meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
Actually, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voters' Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overshadow the retreat," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they existed during the Yugoslav wars in the nineties.
"It can't go on like this, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Voters leader.
The Free Voters want to deport rejected asylum seekers as quickly as possible.
That's why Aiwanger also called for more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states."
"Bavaria deports, others don't."
"We have to become more capable of acting."
But the state politics in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-running issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "Mittelstufe plus" at 47 grammar schools, in which an extension of the gymnasiale Mittelstufe from three to four years is tested - as a result, it takes nine years until the Abitur.
But that doesn't go far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of the G9 must be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all grammar schools that want it.
Free travel with the G9 wherever it is desired.
Firmer Wall Street helps Dax get off the ground
The German stock market has closed with profits after a largely directionless and nervous trading process.
Only in the afternoon, a firmer start of the US stock markets ensured a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax of medium-sized stocks gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.

Trading venues in London and Paris also posted solid gains.
In the USA, the Dow Jones index was recently up around 1 percent.
Many stock market participants expect that the markets will tread water until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also to the big decline on the futures markets this Friday.
The discussion about the burdens of the nuclear phase-out has pushed RWE's shares to a record low in the meantime and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to "Spiegel", the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The German government denied the figures quoted in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately always lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax.
According to a trader, a positive report by the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend had an effect.
Accordingly, investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip manufacturer.
The investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The shares of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW rose by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen benefits rose by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the current yield on listed German government securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex bond index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Bund future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro fell in the afternoon to 1.1262 dollars.
Around noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
Violence erupted Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10 September.
He was killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could go into effect on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emden youth center Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, commerce and residential is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an approximately 4000 square meter plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth center.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, commerce and residential.
One waits for appropriate offers, it says on the part of the city.
Which investor comes into question, is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the corner of Ringstraße and Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Kleiner Meer near Emden are taking shape.
The investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time.
Many residents are still worried - they fear the sell-out of their leisure retreat
For months there had been negotiations, pondering, debating and drawing behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement at the Kleiner Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emden company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Emden Council.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP parliamentary group, who accused the investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the System-Bau management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to counter all rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among sea stall owners who had come to the meeting provoked the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbudenbesitzer and board member at the residents' advocacy group, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a huge block that towers over all other buildings".
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "Whole busloads have to come for it to pay off," says Schulz.
What exactly happens on the one-hectare site of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans were still variable.
Twin offspring of gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to offspring among its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined, as mother Dian has so far kept them close to the body.
First, the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde's southernmost islands that has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Doubling Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the appeal for donations on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally raised donations will be doubled to $11 million, up to a value of $5.5 million to google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
It's too early to tell whether mildly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show anything," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery, or bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain level of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they've been collecting in a study since 2007, comparing two types of bariatric surgery — gastric bypass and gastric tube formation — to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained about the same at 29 among those who received nonsurgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had diabetes completely resolved and 28% partially resolved.
In the medically treated group, in comparison, diabetes resolved completely in only one percent and sometimes only in about two percent.
In addition, the results in controls for blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" — as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average outcomes on the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and were more likely to complete resolution of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival among the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have their bodies firmly linked to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse."
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving more attention in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unsightly at school, meets the crush of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in Luisa Binder's recently published novel "Eigentlich sind wir nicht so".
Beyond the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it takes place in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to erect a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should take precedence over the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not commensurate with the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the violent US response led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in hand sanitizer intake by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer intake among children under age 12 reported by poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids drink disinfectants on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teens allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for them," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't leave a sip of whiskey standing around, but people keep these hand sanitizers within reach of kids, and if kids get to it, then consuming a lot of alcohol is a quick way to do it.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently took four splashes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah shouted her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen from the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizer out of reach of the child.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their "mean" teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned her from her room.
The police considered the foiled plan to be "chatter" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the crossbar between Nordring and Auf Herden, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a rear-end collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar in the direction of the roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused property damage of about 10,000 euros, police said.
The Audi of the 33-year-old was no longer roadworthy and had to be towed.
Rumour mill: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths downplays talk of disharmony at Celtic, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson allegation and Warburton will be wary of January signings that could destroy roster unity
Dons extend lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, leaving the Dons a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths downplays talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths. He insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the return of Rangers.
You talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of excitement in Old Firm games, and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, Deila vows.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic have to fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point advantage.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad times before and we will be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautious about January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new signings, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The ex-boss of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate, which you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, in talks with Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts suspended on SFA battle due to Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was later lifted – Collum's third red card to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, insisting, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was rebuked after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was the heat of the moment," said the striker, adding: "It's safe to say I won't return to Tynecastle unless it's playing for Celtic."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're going to get the guys back on their feet," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to "win ugly" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win that gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that has not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people out of work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was higher than the UK's of 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunks disturbed the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials could take the disturbers into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 per thousand in a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per thousand and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to be afraid.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and with often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it emotionlessly.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants it, and you will gain access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have phrased it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write.
When he dies, he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go into all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I believe there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy water, just metres from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship soccer player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to evade an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards are trying to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed they were running a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and that he has found himself in difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobalt swab sample in lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like grapes hanging too high."
"I didn't intend to say anything about it, and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that it all comes out all at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't do this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I then have to think about what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody had dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — whom I'll name when I'm asked — offering him employment in my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They apparently believe that I am a fraud.
If that's the case, surely they should grab their noses because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should this make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blames people outside of coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take away my license and disown me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying makes them think about it now.
But I've now reached the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, which was against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to his leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday, which it was.
But it also had it that way on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An inquiry into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but we've gone too far here," Moody said.
Man arrested after hit-and-run
Police arrested a man in Cobram over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent hit-and-run.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with hit-and-run and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offenses.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital. It is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over wrestling allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as an "agenda-setting" of two NRL Premier League favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "wrestle" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Bronco coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled remark about the Storm team after his side scored Saturday night's final win over North Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a "prime example" of rugby league and said the two from Queensland were not "too good" at wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackle, saying they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that criticism of his team from two leading coaches gave him confidence, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps popping up — I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year. But over the last six weeks, we've made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that's been the turnaround for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to coach. So he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this keeps popping up at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's going to give a damn about it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have those kinds of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things, because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roosters game scored a higher score than the Broncos vs. Cowboys game.
The Broncos' game was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are taking breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at one stage.
The Storm team has this weekend off, as they won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who faces a life sentence for attempting to obtain 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to possess the entire amount and that he may have been in the café for a harmless reason.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned about Maksimovic's risk of absconding.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 bail as security to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the requirement of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone won't be enough to stop him from showing up, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and observe a curfew of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Driver's cab tears apart
In a rear-end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to swerve to the left at the last moment, police said.
The cab of the person responsible for the accident tore apart completely.
The driver was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.m.
There was a damage in the amount of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to entice pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone as she slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "related" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he did it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and whom he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant about them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, violating the conditions on January 25 this year, and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not appear on the register of sexual offenders, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers switch to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints at the german-Austrian border.
Many smugglers increasingly left people at smaller border crossings for fear of detection and arrest.
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal police.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and weirs.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
At Munich Central Station, according to Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the german-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of gusts of wind in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Because of a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, said the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the offshoot of tropical storm "Henry", which has moved from the Bermuda Islands across the Atlantic in recent days.
Violent storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour are expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district.
On Friday, therefore, the sun can be seen longer again.
It's all in the crowd: Every two years, car manufacturers present their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, there was a particular movement in compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), this segment accounted for around 28.1 percent of new registrations in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept cars and new luxury and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be available at dealerships in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It is part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel holds out the prospect of an entry below its biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessians offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door hatchback.
As a second variant, the station wagon will follow in the spring, which can already be seen at the IAA.
And apart from the Astra, what other new compact cars will be produced at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door model in a conventional and a decidedly sporty GT version.
It will go on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: Brand new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand's design line.
The basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
The offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: Also new to the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Sales of the Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot mainly put their hands on the front end: Here, the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system in particular was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be added to the compact class at the IAA.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has agreed with an ex-prisoner of the Tegel prison, who was housed for months in a cell that was too small.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in cells that are too small.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were only locked up for a few days in the too narrow rooms (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the prison Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, is now free again, was transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit against the state of Berlin because of the undignified prison conditions failed.
However, the constitutional judges overturned the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appeal and referred the case back there for reconsideration.
They see the human dignity of men violated.
Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention were decisive for the compensation from the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, "a withering away of the legal protection of personality would be to be feared".
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, for example, they awarded damages to a prisoner because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a decision from 2011, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
For three months, the plaintiff at the time was accommodated for between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
Berlin's prisons have also hit the headlines in recent weeks due to a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 positions in Tegel are not filled due to a lack of young talent, 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What can Germany expect?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, and according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we can do it."
The following overview provides an overview of what lies ahead for Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: Every year, 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of rent control, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be built annually and for this the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany will be able to work in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift in Germany: from banning refugees from working to recognising work.
While there used to be a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society, the majority view has prevailed - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient range of general and job-related language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often placed through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the development of networks is therefore the ideal way to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the kindergartens, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the daycare center, the administration distributes flyers in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example, by allowing more technical schools.
In the Länder, students without knowledge of German are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The Deutsches Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated persons from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Access to higher education could be made easier for refugees willing to study.
This is because refugees with a temporary residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not receive Bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to bafög.
Tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, but from 1 January 2016 this period will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsches Studentenwerk.
Students should receive Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that would professionally take care of the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant it certain possibilities of control.
This also includes the willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to settle such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be an issue for society as a whole, even more than it is today.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series of murders showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany to do must become reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacities are concerned, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for all arrivals to be given health cards at the time of registration.
Services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to fob off so many people with the limited catalog of benefits provided for by the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the language barriers are the main problem for doctors.
The Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has already shown that migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctors' surgeries, interpreter costs would have to be covered, she demands.
However, many refugees would also be helped by more general medical contact points in emergency departments.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
With the partly different clinical pictures, German doctors would come from their training, but cope, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even be able to alleviate them.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
According to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Anyone suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, tachycardia and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe startleness and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy at the social welfare offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social welfare offices, clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would usually decide whether therapy was necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgements, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the ring on the Ziegelwasen.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior manager.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current arena production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift of enthusiasm is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to get people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours," emphasizes the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Maneg cocktail with cosmopolitan flair" is how director Reinhard Probst describes his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also know their craft.
The Cuban duo wants to easily compete with the heroes of silent films.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast should conquer women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous volleys of laughter, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with tact and agility.
Balancing on a ball with a unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Contortionists fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Maladministration in the keeping of circus animals is all too often an issue for various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either".
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, every wish is read from the eyes as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go into the ring.
So the top priority: take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is especially proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo arrived," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the ring, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are wholeheartedly involved."
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with boos.
Last month, they booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in parliament — this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the Morgan Tsvangirai-led party was "concerned" about the dangers facing politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deepened portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and "will be focused on delivering unprecedented integrated technology solutions to enterprises," according to a company statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift away from traditional PCs towards mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the space, based on the belief that narrowly focused companies perform better.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to stand behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger told Wilshere that it is only September and that if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement in next summer's European Championship is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strong after a separate ankle injury and then regained his old momentum during the preseason.
"This type of injury doesn't threaten your career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
An unpleasant pattern also develops.
Premier Injuries Ltd's research lists 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the past five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to record the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rate will continue during last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period of time, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal kick off their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of Saturday's games against Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is adjusting to a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and give the players who need it a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating playgrounds in Europe.
Dynamo are still unbeaten after 41 games after launching the "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season with their Champions League capitulation to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close to that in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar depictions in shows is evident, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy moods," their chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of sane friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you first have to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled down on the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more profoundly.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments watching football in comfy armchairs, and Ross' longing for Rachel — all of this came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone counseling explained it to me:... "My listening role for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying 'I can handle it' has a huge effect, like the feeling that talking openly about problems is perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish — the entire 236 episodes — for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.
Di Maria scores on his Champions League debut on Tuesday, helping PSG get past Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani stayed the course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with a thrilling 2-0 win over Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who set the French champions in motion, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtyor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of goal. He was later substituted in the match against his hometown team and against the club with whom he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. So it's a good start to win 2-0, cause problems for our opponents and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things we still need to perfect over the course of the season," said Blanc.
"This augurs well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which managed to hold a 2-2 draw on their own pitch against Bordeaux in the First League at the weekend, but he was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger has been touted as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he ran into Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmö defence before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a big victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, started with nine internationals on the field at Anpiff and were a tough opponent with a five-man defence and two lined up deep in midfield.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, which went far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave themselves up, with some missed passes and poor finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who failed on no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he brought his teammates into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria converted into a spinning shot, which was deflected past the post by Wiland in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught up a left cross from Maxwell.
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from close range to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered Glencore said in a statement that it has sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn depresses demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange in trading early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of its broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new stakes at 125 pence per share, representing a 2.4 percent discount to Tuesday's closing price.
It sold 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term sluggish growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, at a state dinner that evening, following bilateral talks between the two leaders.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before heading to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and its growing assertiveness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented move to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
A few years ago, FC Bayern was obviously close to signing Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, twice club world champion, twice European champion, once world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the Euro 2008 before the farewell from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we didn't," he says.
And FC Bayern also registered this.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
However, the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me that I wasn't going to change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, eliminated the Reds (4-0, 1-1) and celebrated the Champions League triumph at the end.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, veteran actor interrupted Brown when she emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, you're talking about the cast of the film, not the cast of the show," Damon said.
Brown reacted with shock, offended disbelief, shouting " Hoo! Wow. Okay," as the actor of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want people to think about — whoever the director will be — how they treat the character of Harmony," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a hooker who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People lobbied for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon replied that her direction "might end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing, "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain diversity to her — that's SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made a nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and agencies to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sport climber and aid driver Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just concluded its 7th season, had never seen a competitor complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the gruelling Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge a full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never made more than $10,000 or had to live on," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
So all of a sudden .. I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, despite being the first ever to finish the course, doesn't get any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it," Weed said.
No matter how much money is a wonderful prize and changes lives, he receives the great gratuity.
I don't think he holds any grudge about that.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received tons of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone beats me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had reversed roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season hasn't been particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at target field.
The Twins wasted a chance to advance within one half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was so elusive for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter what happens," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) served 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game very focused.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was on two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in batting practice, looked much better at bullpen, and he brought it straight into play.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored a color, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy ran over Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run on the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th Major League leader this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer scored an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to score 5–4.
However, the right-hander outperformed Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an immobile Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to a back ailment.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt I was going to make some pretty good pitches in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes traded a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who scored a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 winning streak with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was knocked out of the game as he tried to get to the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers stepped up in the second, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big blow," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by Reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to a throwing shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list because of a shoulder strain, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured roster to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a strain in his right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game streak at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night.
The people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared in recent days for this case.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They are then to be redistributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the Giessen Regional Council, which is responsible for the initial reception.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collectively looking the other way".
Four years ago, people were glad that the chalice of military participation had passed Germany by.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria either.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been talks on this subject between the Director General of Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not name concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come from Hungary to Austria via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
The EU member states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September), the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at the binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the large influx of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to provide more support to the federal states in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the laender, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Angela Merkel underlined that those people who need protection will also receive it.
But those who have no prospect of remaining in Germany cannot stay in Germany.
This view was impressively shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now make a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also seal off the border with Romania with a fence.
Unlike Serbia, this neighbouring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from looking for alternative routes via Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice sheet of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean is sloshing.
This is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon tumbles slightly on its orbit around the ringed planet.
This tumbling movement is only small, but still too large for a continuously solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It had been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed Saturn's so-called E-ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks forced break".
"This hits us hard, Rama is a bitter loss."
"Of course, we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a clubless professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Top scorer Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player should start running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Dusseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to your slim line, you are often advised against them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The skin color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said Tuesday.
Especially drivers are sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95,000 temporary workers for the holiday season.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making earlier arrangements since last year to be prepared for the holiday season.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought the parcel services harsh criticism.
First foehn storm, then striking cold front
In the coming night, the foehn breaks through in the valleys of the north side of the Alps, as MeteoSwiss announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the foehn blows partly with storm force through the foehn valleys.
After the end of the foehn on Thursday morning, a striking cold front crosses us, which brings heavy rainfall, gusts of wind and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a press release, Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwesterly current.
On the north side of the Alps, the foehn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
As a result, the foehn blows until Thursday morning in the foehn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km / h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland sometimes with over 100 km / h.
The foehn can penetrate in places into the adjacent Mittelland, and on the mountains even hurricane gusts of over 120 km / h are possible.
While stormy foehn provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees in the north on Wednesday, the moisture begins to accumulate on the southern slope of the Alps.
Rain sets in here, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected, this after large amounts of rain have already fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the foehn runs out of air, as a result of a cold front with strong, partly thunderstormy rain rolls from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days are autumnal in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, however, it will be sunnier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of Mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened on Wednesday in the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honored as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority could often only live their faith in secret.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
As a young Augustinian monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent a few months in Rome at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he felt that the city was a depraved babel of sin.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the sale of indulgences.
Hammer Künstler invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the major works painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning there was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has preserved his "language" with bright colors and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
For about three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result are cycles dedicated to topics such as Stations of the Cross, plagues, commandments or the Lord's Prayer.
He spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into today, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions twice.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian order.
"Education was done with a cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I tried to work through this in order to perhaps get along with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art regain more importance in fast-paced times: "The perception of visual worlds today is characterized by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In that respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall into" the pictures, let them affect them, discover and feel what power they have: "The picture looks for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not take care to grasp the Bible completely, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." The result was a picture bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen one's life and find freedom".
For Möhler, Otmar Alt's pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on 15 November at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX track approaching
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, mounds modelled for a circuit: One year later almost everything was ready - but even before the official opening of the BMX track it was over again.
Failures in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hills deported, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to announce now in the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
It should then be started without "further memorial break" with the work on the former indoor pool.
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is sending a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is reacting to the worsening situation in Germany and assuring politicians of its help in coping with the problems at hand.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge facing our country since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that this is none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must interest each individual to get this issue under control," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
"I will be at the Federal Chancellery next Wednesday and will meet Minister of State Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role here," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
However, the decisive course must be set by politicians.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 für ein Willkommen" by four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," said Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's, Malta.
Some Bundesliga clubs also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are sending a clear signal when they will wear the imprint "Wir helfen - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as a "matter of course".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one should look away."
"We Bundesliga clubs can, no, we have to use our charisma, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelievably," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great joint effort of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations have started their own projects in their towns is great.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
"This is hugely important," he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection team and the Federal Government, is providing 300,000 euros each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO Loses Eye in Accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has lost his left eye, according to several reports, due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a glass of water that he had carried in his left hand, reported the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled to death, was unconscious, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," the "WiWo" quotes SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could pursue his work.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully operational".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm fully there for SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner the whole time," McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been to the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Something like this can happen to anyone."
"The important thing is to get up again when you have fallen."
McLaren reserve driver Magnussen out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore just as out of the question as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore this weekend, as he was a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of Marco Reus' comeback in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been dashed.
The national player will also miss the Bundesliga leaders in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 / Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't fall back on him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday."
In view of the high load on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his starting eleven in the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, Tuchel left open.
It is highly likely that he will also play the second game.
Midfielder Julian Weigl considers the bold statement of team-mate Reus that BVB's final in the Europa League must be the goal: "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance of grabbing the title."
Robot cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
According to the will of the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor show of a "new age of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who will also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
To ensure that "no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver", the Federal Government wants to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to advocate an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for humans as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is increasingly becoming a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not expected until well after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany at around 8.4 billion euros by 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, Germans are still sceptical about self-driving cars – much more so than the French or Americans.
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that self-driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect self-driving cars by 2025, compared to 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over the control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, 15 percent could imagine this in flowing traffic, in traffic jams 45 percent.
A good one in four would not let the car control under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at European Table Tennis Championships
According to the current state of affairs, the Düsseldorfer only wants to serve in singles at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is expected by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsor appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo it's a disadvantage, we're no longer such a clear favourite," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the seeding list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing and we became European champions."
"We should orient ourselves on that," said the world number five.
Manchester United England international Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit during a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis pointed to a shin fracture in the 20-year-old teammate of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure horror cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"It used to be bleached, but now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which can be seen from 18 September in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude towards a show about himself.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the almost incomprehensible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed any training.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellently choreographed work of art, for which a lot of effort was made: To style the dolls, for example, a stylist was hired.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a lederhosen outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy bear can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer's first, tentative fashion attempts.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad at football), he put bras and dresses on his teddy, Gaultier said.
His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, of course, I bought them.
For his first own fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were produced in large quantities for customers, who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives a few examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, is an increasing potential for orders.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauen Lace and Embroidery Industry Association.
Only they may bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have collapsed.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade are almost non-existent.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Nowadays, mass-produced goods are produced much cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the embroidery pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from Asia, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
This creates a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to retain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball lace.
The machine embroideries small beads in some places.
The Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before that, I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, she embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a souvenir.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares to make a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, this is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director has already been decided: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in cinemas.
Xi urges wider opening of economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business creation strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Encouraging start-ups and pushing ahead with reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list regulating market access, easing border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to raise private capital, and overhauling the resident registration system.
After the statement, a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is significant because it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensures a rule-of-law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open up state-controlled sectors, more areas will be opened up for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residency or the "green card" by streamlining requirements and simplifying the application process.
The right of lawyers to carry out their duties and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus expect consumers to receive a significantly higher dose of the neurotoxin.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper of the EU, criticized the plans sharply: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
Foodwatch described this as a "trick", however, because smaller non-predatory fish, such as carp, are usually so low contaminated that they already comply with the planned maximum values.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversionary maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which accumulates heavily via the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn children".
However, the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is released into the environment mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry to Green MP Annalena Baerbock, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted in March from the paper.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
