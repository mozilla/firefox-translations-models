A Republican strategy to oppose Obama&#39;s re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center dismisses the latter as a myth, affirming that voter fraud in the US is less common than the number of people killed by lightning.
Incidentally, in 10 years, Republican attorneys have only recorded 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for conducting state elections.
With this in mind, since 2009, the majority of American governments have promulgated new laws that complicate the process of registering or voting.
This phenomenon gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to provide photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny citizens with a court record the right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states that would require voters to produce photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars have to be paid to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities and those on low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo identification.
This goes even further.
Students, seen as voters increasingly voting for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their institution-issued photo ID.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more heavily for the Republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it&#39;s clear that two out of every three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
Additionally, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states sponsored legislation eliminating voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general election helped register approximately 10 million citizens.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of registrations of new voters in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed legislation aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who pre-voted were African-American, even though they represent only 13% of the state&#39;s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who represented 76% of the electorate, accounted for only 46% of those who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of legislation restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has stepped in to suspend the country&#39;s most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed legislation requiring the presentation of photo identification.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will no doubt make voting more difficult.
Democrat critics have denounced the partisan nature of the legislation passed, with the clear aim of influencing outcomes in key states for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that have passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required on the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, with false negatives or false positives, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already undecided more reluctant to carry out screening tests.
Should the test be taken or not?
We obtained the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the US, there were many confounding factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients with and without screening.
This study also showed that at 12 years of follow-up, there is a 30 to 40% higher chance of metastases forming if early detection was not performed.
That&#39;s why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once cancer is diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to understand the extent of the risk of their cancer, by showing them the possible options where prostate cancer can go untreated if it does not affect their long-term quality of life, and in these cases by being more likely to opt for active surveillance of the disease decides.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer go untreated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
Active surveillance is suggested and treatment is offered as the disease progresses.
One determines with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated.
Therefore, I still recommend carrying out the test.
Most importantly, though, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be done.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool that makes it possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce your risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised enough.
&quot;If there were no more smokers, this number would rise to at least 50%,&quot; says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is believed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It&#39;s also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly harms people&#39;s health.
&quot;Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, being overweight and obese also promotes the onset of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
&quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing Grimm or rectal cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
&quot;The latter can damage the body&#39;s cells and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; he explains.
vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of speaking to his doctor about his concerns and family history.
&quot;Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer.&quot;
The Higgs boson analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or &quot;least wrong&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but data are still lacking to be completely sure.
Still, let&#39;s assume it&#39;s actually the Higgs, since there seems to be little risk of being wrong, and let&#39;s see what it&#39;s all about.
There is an inescapably unavoidable law in this world which means that two objects cannot exist in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don&#39;t try too hard, as you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: Pauli&#39;s exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;, which &quot;state&quot; consists broadly of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, known as fermione, who politely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other move the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists who hold nothing sacred - certainly not this principle, which means they may indeed be in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories&#39; website The Particle Adventure (which is absolutely amazing, by the way), these bosons fall into two groups: the mesons, which we won&#39;t discuss here, and the &quot;force particles,&quot; through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
However, it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or &quot;light particle&quot; which is the &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is &quot;perturbed&quot; at that precise location, somewhat like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This &quot;disturbance&quot; creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons &quot;carriers of force&quot;.
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be &quot;perturbed&quot; for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the exciter has to reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
That&#39;s why a giant particle accelerator like CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring 27 km in circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don&#39;t - for example, a sheet of paper would never stick to the fridge by itself.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, incidentally) have no mass.
Now what can all this research &quot;be good for,&quot; asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they serve to test the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine in detail any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
Incidentally, there are many physicists who eagerly hope that such discrepancies will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes in the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, since it doesn&#39;t offer an explanation of gravity (oops!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (oops again!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume there isn&#39;t.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first continuous wave laser himself (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially seen more as a &quot;laboratory gimmick&quot;.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the tools surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 while working in optics.
Although it wasn&#39;t its original purpose, this sensor now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life with its Dying With Dignity Committee.
Debate must resume shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was consuming him had given him two years to spare.
&quot;You gave me five years to live, I made it seven years,&quot; he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s always a shock, you can&#39;t be prepared for that,&quot; he says.
The illness does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating by himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped with the meal.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his medicine and offering him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
&quot;My biggest wish is for my diarrhea to be cured as it is humiliating,&quot; he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
&quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain individuals.
&quot;It depends on the person&#39;s ability&quot; to accept regression, he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, big events are taking place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer showered with so-called &quot;curative&quot; care from the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is dying &quot;consciously and by asphyxiation&quot;.
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
&quot;I have good children,&quot; she adds.
&quot;I have no more desires in life,&quot; she says, before accepting being put on a mask to help her breathe.
Nevertheless, she is expecting one last visit from her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provide personal hygiene and help with eating.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 residents.
That&#39;s very little considering we&#39;re all going to die one day.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr X a beer, who passed away during the night.
This morning his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
&quot;We help relatives and patients alike,&quot; reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
No two days are the same at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Alongside an old man of 93 enjoying the last family gathering in the courtyard, well propped up on his pillows while toasting in his honor, a young man of 36 dies, accompanied by his parents, his wife and their two young children is surrounded, tragically, after trying everything to survive.
&quot;For the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,&quot; says Dr. Christiane Martel worried with.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the end of life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Home Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major inadequacy in Quebec&#39;s healthcare system that has several physicians specializing in palliative care reluctant to pass legislation regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
A manifesto has been circulating since the month of October, drawn up by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express its opposition to such an initiative.
dr According to Christiane Martel, Quebec&#39;s healthcare system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days in severe pain with no action taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they are not receiving proper health care.
And at the same time, despite the worst prognosis, several oncologists doggedly treat their patients to the last day.
Hélène Richard&#39;s chances of survival were already slim when she stopped arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she said she was sorry I was giving up the fight, she said.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver for not granting their request after their pain was managed by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the management of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care for the Greater Montreal Society of Home Palliative Care, 8% of patients do not respond to pain management.
Thus, at the very end of life, physicians often resort to terminal sedation, which amounts to euthanizing the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of death.
We can no longer pretend not to see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;I want you to put me to sleep,&quot; it means &quot;I want my pain to be relieved.&quot;
The realization of this report was possible thanks to a journalism grant from Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from the Roads Department, companies in the main construction trades, fundraisers for political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great &quot;system&quot; in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An &quot;industry&quot; that was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
&quot;It&#39;s strange how the system has fallen apart since drastic measures were taken,&quot; jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former chief of police in Montreal.
He uncovered the scandal following an in-depth investigation into embezzlement related to Quebec&#39;s road works contracts, to which the then Prime Minister had reluctantly agreed.
The &quot;Duchesneau Report&quot; established a direct link between industry, secret party funding and bribery of officials.
&quot;Since the investigation began in 2010,&quot; he points out, &quot;the Department of Transportation alone could have saved $1 billion on the contracts,&quot; with some controlling their instincts to get their cut!
The Charbonneau commission &quot;has already brought down two mayors,&quot; he adds, in hopes of &quot;uncovering the tactics behind the individuals.&quot;
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, is also making a big effort with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Then there are the police officers of the &quot;Marteau squad&quot;, which since 2009 has caused the Montreal &quot;sewer cartel&quot; to be more cautious in artificially inflating the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a spate of house searches and brought allegations of fraud and corruption against local councilors such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is a suburban mayor.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec&#39;s third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Roads Department and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly accused.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission how the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining public contracts works.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-linked broker, who transferred the money to Union Montreal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay&#39;s party.
Mr. Zambito was involved throughout the 2000s, giving more than CA$88,000 to provincial parties, most notably the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the commission: in ten years he received from the contractor gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as $736,000 in bribes in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other Roads Department officials have admitted to being bribed by artificially inflating bills by 30-40% with false benefits.
In addition, an organizer from the mayor&#39;s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that was filling its coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, starting in 2010, she opposed the sale of a community lot that was purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
Of the investigation that is eventually carried out, she says she is &quot;pulling a thread that will make it possible to understand the workings of the system infiltrated by ants, in order to stop the evil and denounce those responsible&quot;.
She says the procedure is &quot;painful but positive.&quot;
We&#39;re cleaning up the wound, but would need a Montreal-only investigative unit and oversight to prevent the questionable practices from returning.
How to clean.
Regularly.
For his part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but is particularly concerned about the role of &quot;office holders who know the tactics&quot; when they were not involved in the scam!
Referring to the fact that black money accounts for 70% of the financing of Quebec&#39;s election campaigns, he quips: &quot;I was told that this was only a poor imitation of reality.&quot;
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: &quot;As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, there will be black money in politics.&quot;
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public procurement and party funding: &quot;We cannot go any lower; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can put the house back on a firmer footing with more controls and legislation build up.&quot;
If this story damages Quebec&#39;s and Montreal&#39;s international standing, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to take a look into their own backyard...
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
This season you&#39;ve taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress by her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements spur me on to improve my level of play every day.
And with a game, this is even easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I&#39;m not bursting into enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the center of preparatory training at INF Clairefontaine to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer&#39;s newcomers are used to playing games at very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He&#39;s supported by assistant coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he placed in me also explains my performance.
What do you think about the first part of PSG&#39;s season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the top spot from us.
But we lurk in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: this is how we qualified for the round of 16.
What is the club&#39;s goal in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish first in our group ahead of Porto so that we can play the second leg of the round of 16 as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to take concrete shape.
Would it be a huge failure not to win the Ligue 1 title like they did last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
We&#39;re really keen to win that title this year.
We were close last season.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to take the win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be champion with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier&#39;s, had an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media are expecting too much from PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it&#39;s normal that a lot is expected of us.
We totally accept that.
However, when we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and you still find something to blame us for, it&#39;s definitely a bit frustrating.
One wonders what else people expect.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We&#39;re trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds over time.
We showed strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has failed to qualify for the last 16 for two seasons and has also made huge expenditures!
With regard to the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead at the break!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who weren&#39;t good last season, have been &quot;boosted&quot; by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winners, telling ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we finally won it.
PSG seem completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic&#39;s performances.
All the better that one speaks of a &quot;Zlatan dependency&quot;.
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That&#39;s why he came and he&#39;s proving he&#39;s the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to progress.
How did you experience EURO 2012 with the French national team?
Such a disappointment.
It was important to me to take part in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting some playing time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to realize good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the &quot;Bleus&quot;.
We have learned our lesson from what happened in Ukraine and today we must set an example.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps&#39; first months at the helm of the &quot;Bleus&quot;?
He has achieved promising results.
We&#39;re in a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don&#39;t want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the &quot;Bleus&quot; to Brazil.
Is the forced draw (1-1) in Spain on October 16 a game opener?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone stood up for everyone else.
Before that encounter in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between participants.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), Bitcoin is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchanges like BitTorrent, which allows files to be exchanged directly.
With 15,000 computers in the network, around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoin as a donation or as a form of payment.
After peaking at $30 in June 2011, Bitcoin&#39;s price fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com). ).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trading of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to traditional currencies&quot;.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as the &quot;credits&quot; used to advance in a video game, which can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is always controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the account book, auditors, issuers of money, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Any transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction are electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are present in the ledger of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a math problem launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a sort of interim central banker, having the privilege of adding that extra line.
It is file fragmentation, ie converting a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers &quot;take&quot; the new transaction and add a number to it before &quot;hacking&quot; the whole thing.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
When this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it&#39;s the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to cheat twice using the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible to a hundred millionth, which leaves a certain leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
&quot;The exploited vulnerability does not affect the actual protocol,&quot; assures Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, which is a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on money laundering opportunities using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
A &quot;mega sale&quot; was launched in November.
&quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a company that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses bitcoin to validate transactions, making them cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by traders and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is enter an address that can be &quot;photographed and recognized&quot; by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of rethinking hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal systems.
&quot;It will take some time for bitcoin to catch on, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB&#39;s report provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are currently considered to be high should this currency succeed.
We pulled out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan peasants by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and disabled.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but also often peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will be gone as western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I watched from a hill planted with almond trees and financed by French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
The truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more influx of Taliban into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was engulfed in war due to the fighting of the various insurgent groups.
Their seizure of power was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban share a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into profiteers, seizing government land to sell for construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, capitalizing on massive American subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them did not take part in the fighting themselves.
From what I&#39;ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that isn&#39;t made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as do those who have benefited from American grants: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of both girls and boys.
Jobs will have to be made available to these young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with cell phones; television with its Turkish series depicting a modern world is watched everywhere.
An army now exists.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the provincial militias, which will evade the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization along the lines of western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted it to be a centralized state with a strong make presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want any foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are non-existent and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced apart from fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that western countries were only there to seize it.
Mining is impossible without energy to process the iron or copper ore locally, or transportation to export it over the mountains.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the vast Buddhist site and remaining the province&#39;s main employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which largely depend for imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20th.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls&#39; and boys&#39; high schools, institute of French at universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a &quot;Civil-Military Actions&quot; service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous community works and actions for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and commissioned them by a small French non-governmental organization in order to trying to &quot;win hearts and minds&quot; and accomplish the impossible task of reconciling assists and offensive action.
These works, which required a large number of local workers, have helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir are we leaving behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve the local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale farming projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
In order for the farmers to liberate themselves from the foreign-led insurgency, which they say they want, it would require the continuation of smaller, well-controlled and directly affecting civil aid in their favor.
A crowbar constitution in Egypt
It is a new poker game from President Mohammed Morsi.
As Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration temporarily granting it full powers, it has decided to gamble all on one card.
To everyone&#39;s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt his final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two extra months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, for almost two years now, weakening institutional stability and creating legal confusion.
This new initiative has only further divided the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot; by continuing to &quot;break his word&quot; and &quot;trespass on the law&quot;.
On the part of its supporters, assurances are given that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
It&#39;s also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
According to an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
Especially since the Egyptian people are being presented with an ultimatum by resorting to a hasty vote: &quot;Either you vote for my draft or I keep unlimited powers&quot;, the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the constitution was declared in mid-November, they backed down, believing they had been unable to get their views across.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
To reach a quorum, 11 alternate members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles were mostly passed unanimously.
Incidentally, commentators found it amusing that the only disagreement of the day...was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the Constituent Assembly pendulum clock was not accurate.
The text, which was approved yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that &quot;the principles of Sharia are the principal source of law&quot;.
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace &quot;the principles&quot; with &quot;the rules&quot;, which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
&quot;Hypocrisy&quot; retorted the liberals, who saw this as just a propaganda ploy.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place via other articles.
They pay particular attention to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly with regard to verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because &quot;the people asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
Here one can see the first signs of a theocracy&quot;.
The Liberals&#39; fears are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
&quot;Currently, no concrete religious commitment can be identified.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema, but academics, some of whom were trained in the French system,&quot; says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he admits &quot;that there may be an ambiguity in relation to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the &quot;Fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence, ed. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to what extent civil judges are competent to rule on this.&quot;
In addition to its religious aspect, the text approved yesterday has been heavily criticized for the wide powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the military&#39;s wish, defense budget scrutiny will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defense council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil trials in military courts, as the human rights defense associations have called for.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they see as a threat to freedom.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no more articles refer to the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is that Article 36 prohibits torture.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern conveniences and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Bow to the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river will receive God&#39;s blessings.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on water, calming the storm at sea, and catching fish.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers walk the Passion or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The trail starts from the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the judgment was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on Mount Golgotha, where the Crucifixion site, the Anointing Stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
According to the Christian view, this is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the spot where, according to Christian legend, grew the tree from which the cross for Jesus&#39; crucifixion was made.
Jerusalem is also home to the Jews&#39; holiest site - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a journey to the top
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins under their own steam.
For everyone else, a cable car takes you to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous Hermon ski area, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the base of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited in one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (parliament).
Ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea Scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert are kept there, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is on display there.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of visitors and bath attendants of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most harrowing chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the Children&#39;s Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who perished in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room it is completely dark.
stars twinkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
do something for your health
The three main resort areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, people bathe in the Red Sea even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, with a location of 417 meters below sea level, this unusual sea is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimmers on the surface without any problems.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and medicinal mud, to treat skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to soothe stressed nerves.
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and it was here that Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is kind to everyone who touches the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can find newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries having photo ops.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theater and conquer the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater now hosts evening concerts and operas.
Tourist watch list
If you go to Israel, don&#39;t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
It is better to take the money on the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged for shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
Buses get you around the city most of the time, but Jerusalem also has an express tram and Haifa has the country&#39;s only six-station subway line, connecting the lower and upper cities.
Strictly speaking, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a trip of up to 1.5 hours including changes.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transport is at a standstill.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants, and inns, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales, and dishes containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of mutton and beef dishes, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of mashed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and unmolested.
In the evenings you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and won&#39;t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance is an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and those seeking relaxation came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on February 9, 2011.
&quot;The Great and Powerful&quot; leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading in fake certificates
Every year 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families who remain in their homeland.
On December 1, a law came into effect requiring every migrant worker to take a test proving knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in municipal housing and in retail.
However, according to the federal migration authority, the tests should become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
You have to pass not only language tests, but also tests on Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are people who obtained their educational certificates and diplomas before the breakup of the USSR in 1991.
Purpose, problems and protection of rights
All of the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, Peoples&#39; Friendship University of Russia, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in any city; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Service on Migration.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, repeatedly asked the following question in the press before the law came into force: What is the point of all this?
What changes does the requirement to show language skills bring, both for Russians and for guest workers?
Above all, counter the spokesman for the migration authorities, the aim is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
&quot;A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers,&quot; says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency&#39;s office in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of foreign workers&#39; problems.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a job, education, language skills or a medical examination.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant who does not speak the language will inevitably encounter people with malicious intentions who, under the pretense of help, will put him in a dark, cramped barracks, where he will remain with dozens of his peers for months and 12 to 14 hours without food or documents will toil in the day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
&quot;You&#39;re promised one thing at home, and when you arrive you&#39;re cheated, your passports are taken away and you don&#39;t get the wages you promised,&quot; confirms the head of the main administration for labor migration at the Tajik Migration Agency, Tolib Zwaripov.
Don&#39;t scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn money in Russia admit that not only do they not speak the language of the destination country, but also that they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can even afford a decent primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize their first opportunity to earn money.
&quot;It&#39;s difficult without language skills,&quot; they admit.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers continue to be in Russia illegally.
&quot;Welcome&quot; or &quot;No unauthorized access&quot;
Many migrants confirm that obtaining official status in Russia is not easy.
The reasons are bureaucratic hurdles and of course the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that most of our documents are forged and we are unregistered, and this leads to cases of extortion.
&quot;They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,&quot; Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
&quot;Don&#39;t shy away from the expense of false papers&quot;
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants could be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for free: each migrant hoping to avoid the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That&#39;s more than twice the cost of the official test, which costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both public officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot simply be bought.
For now, the authorities can only promise migrant workers who fail the test the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas that do not require active communication with people.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Extremely low proportion of legal firearms in criminal offences
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten gun laws for private gun owners.
This is how the authorities are reacting to recent events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the killing spree by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
Police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age of firearm ownership from 18 to 21.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities want to solve the problems by &quot;tightening the screws&quot;.
An open letter was published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various weapons associations - call on the authorities to refrain from &quot;senseless tightening&quot;.
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC&#39;s Russian service.
According to Interior Ministry statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during the six months of 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand offenses were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law on private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The guns find their way onto the black market through multiple channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army, or rather, the military, that is, weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
&quot;The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,&quot; says Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from police armories and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons stores.
Many military camps were subject to frequent explosions.
&quot;There is evidence that some cases involved arson to cover up the lack of weapons,&quot; says the former military man.
According to Baranez, gun manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
&quot;Nowadays there are countless private armaments factories that can&#39;t stand up to international competition and are therefore secretly dumping their weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow,&quot; reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;They have their own, sometimes artisan production there and a mafia that organizes smuggling,&quot; explains the former military man.
Where are the guns from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on weapon-related portals.
According to investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all guns on the black market got there through &quot;the fault of those responsible for their work related to guns,&quot; the report says.
According to the researchers&#39; data, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are from thefts during weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales representative at a gun shop, who asked not to be named, says guns found during illegal digs are no longer bought because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to obtain supplies from an armory.
A weapon, for example a pistol of the TT type, is bought through an ensign.
The gun will be displayed and passed through the fence.
&quot;The dealer brings the gun into town and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines,&quot; he says
&quot;The police, of course, know everything and therefore, when they cannot comply with the crime-detection plan, periodically carry out inspection purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons,&quot; adds the sales consultant.
&quot;Like in a luxury shop&quot;
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to &quot;Begovaya&quot; station, where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only found out the price of the gun there
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
&quot;To get a gun, I need someone I know who has contacts,&quot; says the sales consultant. &quot;I have an acquaintance like that, but I don&#39;t trust him&quot;.
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and make an appointment with a code like &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who says that the daughter has lost a tooth&quot;.
I&#39;m even currently able to get some brass knuckles through a friend I trust.
He&#39;s also only supplying me with the brass knuckles because he knows I won&#39;t rat him out.
Newcomers search for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets was trying his hand at buying illegal guns in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which &quot;everything possible&quot; was shown.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury shop,&quot; the military man recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don&#39;t just buy, I drive into the forest with the seller and we set up a target there.
&quot;I can then shoot there, and when I&#39;m convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in &quot;Vkontakte&quot; where weapons are offered &quot;for various purposes&quot;.
No papers are required, nor are there face-to-face meetings.
&quot;All you need is the right amount of money,&quot; reads the ad on the Buy a Combat Pistol or Rifle website.
This is where users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
&quot;Of course without a license,&quot; asks user &quot;Iwan&quot; (literal quote).
&quot;Buy a TT. Moscow,&quot; is the laconic request from &quot;Fedorenkov.&quot;
The Federal Security Service recently launched a myriad of bogus websites, and buyers looking to purchase guns are hitting the service in droves.
People come like hungry fish to be fed and then end up in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and ex-serviceman Viktor Baranets
I heard about the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
&quot;In response, he received a photo and a description of where the weapon was hidden,&quot; reports Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the non-profit organization &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot;.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that placing a request on a website can end up empty-handed and put behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently launched a myriad of bogus websites, and buyers looking to purchase guns are hitting the service in droves.
&quot;People come like hungry fish to be fed and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,&quot; he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices can range from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization &quot;Pravo na oryzhie&quot;, you can buy a Makarov-type pistol for $100-300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military armories by mid-level Wardens.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the period from January to October 2011, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition , explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are on strike in the United States
One in four young people in the United States sits behind the cash register at Mc Donald&#39;s at some point
In recent days there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&#39;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Nobody can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon run out of steam again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the meager wages of humble Walmart and fast-food workers, protest organizers aim to form unions.
So far, this branch of the economy has hardly been organized in unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on Black Friday, which saw sell-offs across the US attracting millions of shoppers, at times leading to scuffles.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, walked out and, along with unions and left-wing activists, went on strike at the chain&#39;s stores that target low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many of Walmart&#39;s low-wage workers shop only at their workplace.
The prices and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart is often only able to sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example a lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
The participants in the Black Friday protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger at the fact that company health insurance premiums had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who makes $9.5 an hour, can&#39;t afford that increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company raises the median wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That&#39;s about 1.1% more than they donate now for wages.
If Walmart passed the wage increases on to customers in full, each purchase would only cost them 46 cents more in the future.
That would be just $12.39 in additional spending per year compared to today.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that protests broke out in only nine states and left the company with no losses.
Black Friday lasted in its stores from 8pm Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Altogether, Walmart checkouts processed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Company spokesman Dan Fogelman, in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post, claimed that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees walked out and that the protest was simply &quot;another PR ploy&quot; by the union running the protests organized.
&quot;Free checkout!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York, but their targets were not Walmart stores (which are undesirable in this progressive city and therefore non-existent), but McDonald&#39;s and other budget restaurants.
McDonald&#39;s says the company sells billions of servings and yet you are not given sick days and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually increasing the minimum wage, but not too much, and their average New York workers are getting paid $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city earns less than them.
How it is possible to live in New York on so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American youth would stand behind the counter at McDonald&#39;s after school, though the youth still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, when I interview McDonald&#39;s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to make do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don&#39;t know how to feed them.
Protesters, who began Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of the McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food restaurant cashiers and cooks be paid a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of unions in the fast food industry.
US law prohibits management from interfering with this goal by reprimanding or firing union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
Establishing unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
unsatisfied
There were loud protests in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan that day.
The culmination of the protests was a lunchtime rally outside Times Square&#39;s McDonald&#39;s, at which a number of local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&#39;s says it sells billions of servings and yet you don&#39;t get sick days and you will not be paid for your honest work!&quot;
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York City Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we should collectively support the fast-food workers so they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that we want every New Yorker deserves!&quot;.
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were there, far from all of whom are employed in the fast-food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
&quot;So far, the brain can only be moderately outwitted&quot;
The theme of augmented reality, popular among fans of modern technologies, has lately been usually perceived through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, speaking to Shahram Izadi, group leader for interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft&#39;s Cambridge labs, it becomes clear that the glasses were just a way station for the company&#39;s scientists.
She is excited by the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has mostly been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are also sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without a Kinect as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We&#39;re trying to change that, working on true three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projection.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first of all, let&#39;s get rid of those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She&#39;s popular, but isn&#39;t she overrated?
- It&#39;s certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises privacy issues because you don&#39;t always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its own particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public spaces, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and succinct gestures rather than expansive ones.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But all in all, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- As the?
- We would ask me, for example, to pass you this soda can?
You say it and point to it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can&#39;t do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that make it possible to record people&#39;s reactions more precisely.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- Based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your demands on modern cameras?
Is it lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X and Y axis, but also along the Z axis must be considered.
The speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with an adjustable processing delay ranging from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today&#39;s commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
I needed a device like this for my work, only without touch controls and with more frames per second.
- Shouldn&#39;t the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, since more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera tilts to see how that helps us determine a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present their glasses to the public.
Don&#39;t you think that when it comes to using augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it&#39;s not comfortable to always have a smartphone in your raised hand when you&#39;re on the road, but I think the following: the greatest variant would be an &quot;alternating&quot; augmented reality, where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
Glasses are a personal gadget and that is their strength (only you can see your privates), but at the same time their weakness, because augmented reality using glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to mere mortals.
There&#39;s a problem that critics of this idea often point out: There&#39;s no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group intend to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about augmented reality being the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method at the moment is the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection base.
She takes pressure very well!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving something tangible to the &quot;images in the air&quot;, for example the interference of some directional ultrasound beams in a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling, but that for the moment is still so weak, as if someone blew on the palms of your hands.
There are also wrist bands that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make it think it feels what it should feel when it&#39;s seeing something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried it yet.
Here lies another task that we will struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (unlike in gyms), moving platforms and big balls.
So far, the brain has only been moderately tricked, and we have many busy years ahead.
This is what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Personal taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project &quot;Petersburg Avant-garde&quot;, dedicated to city dwellers who make up the avant-garde of art and culture.
The distinguished list has already included high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements extend beyond the city&#39;s borders and who are often recognized in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who can be found at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller&#39;s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists creating new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and his presence on the streets puts a smile on the faces of his fellow citizens and puts them in a good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg barrel organist, finally feeling ready for this difficult role in terms of artistry, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer concerned with optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates slightly from the gray norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations has been an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was on display.
I realized that I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free painters who were not officially recognized back then came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the new generation of painters, that is, with the representatives of &quot;Gazonevschina&quot;; This resulted in &quot;Puschkinskaya 10&quot;, and then it was over for the time being.
I am drawn to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
- And all this combined in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room at 10 Pushkinskaya Street, and before the renovations there was a bohemian music and art club, the House of Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequilajazzz, and I also remember Schnur got there with his project &quot;Ucho Van Goga&quot;.
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wore tight leotards, and included the now-popular composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of &quot;Halli-Galli&quot;.
We gave them Trachtenberg and his great career began, but he learned the basics from us.
The gallery &quot;D 137&quot; or the club &quot;Griboedov&quot; also have their roots in the art clinic.
That&#39;s where our employees and regular guests went.
I&#39;m a hero of the last century when culture still mattered.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the &quot;Personalities of our City&quot; award.
I won the Artist of the Year category, and that was my pinnacle.
It is not easy to work by old rules in new times; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
It&#39;s easy to become famous these days, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the theme &quot;The Russian Museum as Clowns&quot;.
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares to be like that.
In a clown it all blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let&#39;s save the world by requiring everyone to wear full disguises.
Now everyone pays attention to clothing and is guided by the outside and not the inside of the person.
But maybe you shouldn&#39;t shake hands with someone, you should spit in their face.
The deception disappears through disguise.
- We recently saw you in the role of the city organ grinder. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
If not me, who?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
People used to form large groups: the bohemians loved one thing and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro communities and it is difficult to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who will please you.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- Several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov&#39;s performances!
- Abandoned women come to him, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, less money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which even hung in a collector&#39;s house in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that usually only come at the end of a career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that&#39;s something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up around artists who lived and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
That&#39;s the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what is missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars might not have understood much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are good advisers in Moscow at the moment.
In St. Petersburg we have some who might be experts, but their way is blocked because it needs higher-level experts to properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don&#39;t accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look to other museums as a result.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
It is difficult for art to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that&#39;s not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us it&#39;s a lot less.
Art must be modern again, like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
birth in space
earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises, how can we reproduce in zero gravity or on the replacement planet?
I don&#39;t think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could inhabit, at least hypothetically.
&quot;Namely Mars and Venus,&quot; says research associate at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively hospitable to life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers initially dealt with the question of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Experiments with plants had already been carried out half a century before that.
The fourth generation of orbiting peas was no different from the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how microgravity affects embryo development.
A normal chick will develop.
But then the problem begins.
&quot;The problem is that the chick has to find support; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving,&quot; explains Vladimir Sykhev, laboratory head of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks rolled wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborn&#39;s instincts were completely dulled.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later they just died.
&quot;Twice we hatched chicks and then stopped the whole thing because it&#39;s just impossible to work with them there,&quot; Vladimir Sychev says of the failed experiment with chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will be continued.
However, only species of the same sex will be on the Biosatellite &quot;Bion&quot;.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already fertilized.
In principle, nothing special was found.
&quot;That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment and research needs to continue,&quot; notes Vladimir Sykhev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
In contrast to animals, humans could do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova was at greatest risk.
The most valuable thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: will it survive spaceflight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight?
&quot;In the end nobody answered this question,&quot; says space veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child&#39;s father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have extremely few cosmonauts who, after long flights, went well and gave birth to healthy offspring.
&quot;The more, the more dangerous it is, even when flying into orbit,&quot; concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must search for new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory in the cosmonauts&#39; preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water pleasant, it&#39;s a strange environment; but infants experience water as a natural element.
It&#39;s as if the little ichtyanders bear witness to the fact that life on land rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother&#39;s womb in the amniotic fluid for about 9 months and that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since it takes just 2 weeks from birth to the first swim.
&quot;That&#39;s not enough time to forget something,&quot; says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while weightlessness is a much more natural state for a newborn child, women cannot do without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles recede extremely quickly and the ability to push the child out also decreases.
Alright, let&#39;s get around that with labor inducing devices.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
&quot;But what happens then?&quot; is the not insignificant question from Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling gravity, the organism cannot develop the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a stress suit for training in orbit like an adult.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
&quot;This experiment that we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us giving birth to a disabled person, a completely non-conformist,&quot; says the head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestov, ahead.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the earthlings set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that will become the home for their space-born descendants.
NKÚ boss: Control of the Schwarz system failed through the fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, Vice President of the Supreme Control Board (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ) Miloslav Kala said this.
&quot;A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case with us,&quot; Kala comments on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German auditors apparently came to a similar conclusion.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called &quot;black system&quot;.
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
&quot;A law has to be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the head of the government can&#39;t just come and hinder the work of the control office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law,&quot; says Kala .
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project to compare the two countries&#39; laws on public procurement.
What was it about specifically?
This is a parallel audit that we started about two years ago.
Put simply, it is about the European legislature determining how public contracts are to be handled. National legislation builds on this. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
We&#39;ve compared all of these and, although the review is ongoing, we&#39;ve found some very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws here are perhaps even a little &quot;stricter and more perfect&quot;, but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep setting new and more precise rules. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What does this project mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and lower and balance thresholds when this does not appear to be having a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means acquiring an item at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be the case that in this way we just burden the system with excessive &quot;paperwork&quot; and those looking for loopholes in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds stayed higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Office, which has a similar structure to ours and also has a board that is only formed slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work in a similar way.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, which means that these audit offices also exist in the individual federal states - this is where the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities in our country, are subject to the control of the state audit offices there.
As for German legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often cited as a role model in certain respects, although one certainly cannot say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the examiners are better there?
Definitely not, but as I said: I don&#39;t particularly like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are role models for us also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t benefit from working with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, how important was the amendment to the Public Procurement Act for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment has only been in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our tests.
Since our controls take place afterwards, you have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have felt the effects more in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we introduced the new control instrument &quot;Detection of risks of inefficiency&quot; and used it to examine and analyze almost 14,000 public contracts - the changes will of course have an effect here, as the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc
Do you see the passage of this law as positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem can arise that the rules become &quot;stricter&quot; and can no longer be observed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subjected to an audit are accountable to the promoter (for example, in the case of a regional policy operational programme, the regional council) such that any non-compliance with the procurement law amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it then make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don&#39;t think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not penalize those who have made a formal error that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where is the way out here?
First of all, let&#39;s say which way is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called &quot;black system&quot; - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must still be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come and hinder the work of the control office, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law.
He can say, &quot;We&#39;ll change the law and allow it,&quot; but he can&#39;t say we&#39;re pretending it&#39;s nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules about the formal execution of certain processes - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and that&#39;s what I think we&#39;re lacking.
The roads are occasionally icy, but mostly they are dry.
There is sometimes snow and ice on the roads in the Czech Republic.
Most of the roads are easy to drive on, however, increased caution is sometimes required.
Carlsbad
In the Karlovy Vary district, the roads were passable this morning, with isolated patches of snow and ice.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region and only a thin layer of snow remains at the lower altitudes.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
According to the district road patrol, visibility was limited due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class traffic routes in the region are currently open to traffic without restrictions.
However, attention is called for on bridges, for example, where the roadways are sometimes icy and slippery.
All traffic routes of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, some sections of icy or worn-out snow remain on these roads.
Increased attention is therefore required, especially at higher altitudes.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a risk of ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes still a layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate reports on its website.
The road maintenance departments warn drivers of icy conditions, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
In particular, icy roads can occur on second and third class roads in the Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto districts.
Roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
In particular, there is snow on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory mountains.
A deep layer of snow lies at high altitudes on the roads of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In East Bohemia it will be mostly sunny or clear today with little precipitation.
Temperatures fluctuate between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen district
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today, but locally you need to be more vigilant and drive in accordance with the weather.
It will be chilly in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Because it snowed beforehand and the temperatures dropped afterwards, the roads can become icy.
Fog is also to be expected locally, although visibility will improve as the day progresses.
This information comes from the district road maintenance departments.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestrictedly passable, but the road maintenance departments recommend paying more attention between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The lanes of the first road class are mostly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov districts, however, there may be sections of icy roads.
The lanes of the second and third class of roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections also applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc district
Drivers who are heading towards the higher altitudes in the Olomouc district have to reckon with slush today.
After the use of gritters, slush remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snowstorms forced the road maintenance departments to act, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of fresh snow fell in the Šumperk district.
In the other areas of the district, the lanes are mostly passable without restrictions.
&quot;In the Šumperk district, there are still remains of snow at high altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers must expect slush in the direction of Jeseník,&quot; an employee of the Šumperk Road Administration told the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to her, the roads up to the higher altitudes are clear and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully passable, but in the Šternberk district drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, because the roads are still wet here.
District Ústí nad Labem, District Liberec
In northern Bohemia, the road maintenance departments report several poorly passable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí nK district is closed according to the traffic police.
Temperatures will remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so snow and ice will remain on the roads. On the other hand, no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially south-east of the Bohemian Uplands, and the roads there are usually dry.
So far, no traffic disruptions have been reported.
Black ice is reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless skies and frost at night.
Poor traffic conditions are reported on the main routes and on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí nL and Liberec districts.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be closed due to branches being pressed down to the road surface by the snow load.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world happening in less than a month?
This is one of those catastrophe reports that we humans like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap we rather make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce our readers to the project in more detail?
It&#39;s a nationwide fundraiser that we&#39;ve been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is predicted to end on December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, ie December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 9:00 p.m.
The concerts are scheduled to end around the time that the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in a time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally by me, we then developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world entitled &quot;End of the World&quot;.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world doesn&#39;t happen...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together in a direct broadcast on Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings along...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we organize many charity events and concerts...
We try to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various free time activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, which we will then move into with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you use to select them?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar &quot;major events&quot; planned for the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, and we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert as well.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and personally - while we&#39;re in the USA - I would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly small, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It&#39;s not as bad as it first appears.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, which means that the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Of course, we also have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage with us...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, which sometimes surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently went, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of how accessibility is in the individual countries, how disabled people are treated there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we in Russia were witnesses to the fact that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped accessible. There it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to walk around the city center alone.
It is not even a matter of course there that a wheelchair user is allowed to enter the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things we are lagging behind on...
However, it should also be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities to be able to move around independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a large group of disabled people to actively participate in social events there. With the band The Tap Tap we are a little ahead of the west!
Public respect and accessibility are one thing, but it&#39;s not until a major athlete, artist, actor, politician or lawyer joins our ranks that things will really start to change.
So far, these have only been isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular these days. But if we go back a few years, what motivated you to form a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a tutor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And since I&#39;m a musician myself and play the saxophone, among other things, I founded a music club together with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič likes to say, it got a bit out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It&#39;s true that working with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you achieve something and this cannot be seen from the outside, your own achievement does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also hire good editors, high-quality equipment and the like. afford.
Was your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since anything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long period of time.
There are few things that are truly unique, and I daresay Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; it&#39;s only natural...
But that pity is totally unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings for whom we need to pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, it&#39;s not just a step forward for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as many people say?
If you want to do something well, you can&#39;t make any compromises in many things and you have to demand a certain discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have twice-a-week rehearsals, go through preparatory phases, and spend a lot of time on concert tours, many quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But that&#39;s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, ie since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You can&#39;t prevent that.
Anyone with the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 12/20/2012 at 9 p.m
Venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
At the end, all three venues will be connected live and a joint interpretation of the anthem &quot;End of the World&quot; by the band The Tap Tap will be heard.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multifunctional educational center suitable for disabled people, which is to be built under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
Admission is 400 CZK, children under 12 free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland became the twentieth member of this space agency. This makes Poland the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on November 12, 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Of course, Poland&#39;s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were involved in space travel, although they were not always understood.
I would like to remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on December 6, 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented ideas from his pioneering work &quot;Entrance to Cosmonautics&quot;.
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for &quot;Entrance to Cosmonautics&quot;.
dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski&#39;s contribution to the development of space travel, which is recognized worldwide, was recognized by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway handcar was built in Poland, for which rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the design and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to launch or to brake the handcar.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began dealing with rocket-propelled projectiles.
The research work was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the surviving documents that the research had progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then of course interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric rocket launcher by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot; by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of rocketry were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated by the beginning of the war.
More articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company is in the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to create a space company.
At that time, the first satellite technology projects were already underway, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
From the outset in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) tried to join the International Space Federation founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member as early as autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful Meteorological Rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, and the first launch was on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
An improved version, the RM-1A, was later built, and in 1959 flight tests with the RM-2 two-stage rocket began in the Błędów Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The Meteor 1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965, was the successor to the first RM rockets.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the space for carrying scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport compartment with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965-1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a takeoff weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a 10 kg payload to an altitude of approximately 60 km.
After that, versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth noting Poland&#39;s entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
Repealing the Community Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Law on Community Works.
This decision provoked lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
Ultimately, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Price tensions arise due to large differences in the value of labor (wages).
This term refers to a situation in which the manufacturer attempts to compete economically by importing cheaper goods, &quot;undercutting&quot; the competition in order to gain a larger share of the market and increase profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad, to buy cheaply there, or to go out of business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with one another in order to artificially lower the social standard of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments hand over their own people to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This happens on the one hand through economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand through the curtailment of workers&#39; rights.
The result is growing poverty and widening gaps between rich and poor.
In Germany, for a number of years, there have been public food distribution points for the poor who are no longer able to support themselves through their own work.
The number of those affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which employees receive such low wages that the state has to increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states will undoubtedly result in the same condition, with people being forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in their social standard (as was the case in the 19th century) or for starvation wages on the Starving on the fringes of society and hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
The question that naturally arises here is where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty just moves from one country to another; or there is no capital at all, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa in general, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state is not allowed to contribute capital to its own economy and that a planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital narrow-mindedly insists that the state should not intervene in the economy.
But then you have to ask yourself whether private capital influences or even directs politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby that is ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, a legislation where practically everything is punishable but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to a lack of funds, a state ministry commissions private legal companies, which are closely linked with industry, to draft legislation.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as proclaimed by Western constitutions, but from powerful financial groups that put their own interests first.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are quickly getting into a situation like that described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: &quot;The state had long been in the process of decay, and the offices were filled by force.
In exchange for bribes, by illegally obtaining advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption ran rampant and the people went to the polls with already bought votes&quot; ... &quot;People of character did not run for office, so as a result of this decline the state had no consul for eight months&quot; ... &quot;It was already beginning to really talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is autocracy and that a strong man must be elected&quot;... Appian was thinking of Pompeius, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who implemented democracy permanently replaced autocracy.
As it turns out, today&#39;s society, just like in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference for one&#39;s own advantage without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is incapable of recognizing and implementing the benefits for society as a whole.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, which make no attempt at deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand today, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, with the next round already looming.
What is particularly catastrophic is the fact that today&#39;s elites are faced with the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and modern history , face in complete ignorance.
Repealing the Community Works Act is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase state capital participation in the economy, increase citizens&#39; influence in government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
&quot;...that nothing comes, or could ever come from violence,&quot; sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose key verse in the chorus is &quot;...les us forget how fragile we are&quot;.
&quot;If my sons didn&#39;t want wars, there wouldn&#39;t be any,&quot; says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
As always, after the latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there were a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I don&#39;t want to write here about who is the culprit and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; after all, today&#39;s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing areas, were born into the current political situation and did not themselves experience the onset of the violence.
My point is to give readers a behind-the-scenes look at who the 95 years of tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of country in the Middle East is most serving.
Some of my thoughts are based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influenced the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make out an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is being concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power it generates has not happened in the span of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, one in particular stands out that could be described as the head of the octopus (I don&#39;t know if anyone ranks above them, but I don&#39;t rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s to prevent their name from being associated with highly criminal acts, the background of which was always to consolidate their power, increase their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds have interests in almost every central bank in the world, and against the countries where they do not have interests in the central banks they wage wars or arm themselves against them (7 countries before the Afghan attack, after the Iraq was 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafi only 4 remained, with Russia meanwhile subordinating its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family paid the price with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status of Rothschild&#39;s Bank of America, began issuing his own (read: state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JF Kennedy started issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Rep. Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after attempting to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression of 1929.
The global lust for power of the Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars in the years 1859 - 1871 by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was aimed in particular at breaking the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war was intended to reduce the world population to around 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would be their comforts and luxuries, and would not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is just the forefront here), and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The way the group of wealthiest families, headed by the Rothschilds, works is to create a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the FED, so that crises like the one they triggered in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War by murdering the heir to the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire with the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by loading Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby setting the stage for impoverished masses so that all they had to do was foist on the Germans a strong enough leader who would point out the culprits and offer simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia, with a strong German minority that was intended to, and did, serve as a fifth column to ignite the war conflagration.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke the chain he was initially held by the international bankers or whether everything went according to plan is difficult to tell, but in any case created the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel sets the stage for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, similar to World War II, this time along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country itself but also internationally (just think how sharply divided people are into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, beginning with individual greed and their quest for global power?
A distinction must be made between the people of Israel and their leadership, since the international bankers in Israel, just like we, the people, only nominate their own candidates for election.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a case in point of a fascism-prone politician loyal to the international bankers who is doing whatever it takes to ignite a war with Iran, aggravated by Iran&#39;s membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( China, India, Russia, Pakistan...) could rapidly escalate into a global conflict and devastation due to Iran&#39;s control of the only 2-mile wide Strait of Hormuz, which carries 20% of the world&#39;s oil supplies could come to the global economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller appear in 1994: &quot;All we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order.&quot;
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth, putting that being under total control.
&quot;And it makes that the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, namely, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom! Anyone with understanding should consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man&#39;s number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.&quot;
The movie Argo: Call Hollywood when the going gets tough
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to jettison the shah, as this would have massively damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the installation of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent hostage rescue fiasco only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter&#39;s defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director/actor Ben Affleck&#39;s film Argo describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications at the Canadian Ambassador&#39;s residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran; Helping them do so was an extravagant story to obscure their true identities - they were traveling on Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew supposedly visiting locations for a sci-fi film in the country.
combination of genres
Developed by &quot;exfiltration&quot; expert Tony Mendez, the plan also required Hollywood cooperation.
In order for the cover to be believable, articles about this film project appeared in trade journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time it is also a so-called &quot;caper movie&quot;, ie the story of a successful feat such as the film Ocean&#39;s Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film alternate - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations either).
On the other hand, there are the casual passages from Hollywood, which come across as ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, in the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable new start to his career with this film.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
It&#39;s also Affleck&#39;s first film not set in the director&#39;s native Boston.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that set the director&#39;s previous films above the Hollywood standard.
However, Affleck also shows that flair in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;played&quot; by Canada.
The film&#39;s best scenes are set in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, while still conveying the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when somewhere once the story moves.
Affleck and his team achieve a similar effect with fictional scenes (the fake film staff in a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn&#39;t actually offer many exciting scenes in a cinematic sense.
But he works quite successfully with what little he has, sometimes helping out with reality - which doesn&#39;t always come across as elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or the chase on the runway, seem a bit artificial).
Argo&#39;s weakness is its overly wide spread, driven by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, while charming in their roles as Hollywood staffers, deserve more space for their characters, and they&#39;re far from alone in the film.
As a result, Affleck&#39;s film loses some of its appeal. It&#39;s a movie to watch with some interest, while appreciating the design and retro style reminiscent of a 70&#39;s thriller.
However, it is difficult for him to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive in a certain way today and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are.
Balloon inflation, banana and circus guidelines
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey about the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to organize the competition &quot;Most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop&quot;.
&quot;We got this idea from the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% quota of women in the management of large European companies,&quot; Patrik Nacher, who is in charge of organizing this survey, told the Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively posed less risk to insurance companies.
&quot;Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013,&quot; said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is harmful to nature as a result, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken coops , because of which eggs became significantly more expensive this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;butter spread&quot; and the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs have also received criticism in the past.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often makes decisions under pressure from this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with the threat of a veto) .
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have any &quot;curvature anomalies&quot;.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing inconsistent national standards that would hamper trade.
The norms for fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the opposition of some countries, pointing out that the previous guidelines would lead to food wastage.
A possible candidate for winning this poll is last year&#39;s EU regulation requiring balloons to be sold with a warning that children under the age of eight are not allowed to inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to the age of 14 when using fairground toads.
Strange things happen at home, too
A directive that affects European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who holds an official position in the EU is not allowed to use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and has to say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead .
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the Laissez Faire Association of Liberal Economists, nominated, in addition to the above absurdities, the EU regulation on the size of food stocks on the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day we joined the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, then exceeded the specified volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a large fine.
The poll organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should be paid for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving grants for grant applications.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
&quot;We are handicapped by not having a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU,&quot; declared the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state stocks were overflowing as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was so accommodating to the Czech Republic that it organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
The Ministry for Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered the municipalities funding for applications for funding, specifically funds for submitting applications for funding to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the member states, some experts believe that the EU&#39;s efforts to regulate and thus also to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve more recognition.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were enforced by individual member states during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products, and does not always win this fight, also arouses emotions in this country.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name &quot;Olomoucké tvarůžky&quot;, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our producers had to rename it &quot;Tuzemák&quot;.
The designation rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU, together with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, Lübeck marzipan and Parma ham, now also include Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, and hops from Saaz.
Pardubice gingerbread or Hořice rolls can boast of an EU brand.
&quot;People want me to save the republic, but I&#39;m just an amateur,&quot; Okamura claims.
Senator, how does one come up with the idea of running for President?
I&#39;m not interested in being a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not run for any place.
But I can&#39;t stand the 20 years since the Republic has been plundered, thieves roaming free while people are getting increased taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something I don&#39;t like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I&#39;m in my 40s, and being independent and non-partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than running for Senator or President.
You made it into the Senate and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Isn&#39;t that turning your back on your voters?
I&#39;ve been telling myself all along that I&#39;ll take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I clarified this and said that I would run for President if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
To do this, I need as much influence as possible and the strongest possible mandate.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people complain in the pub and in front of the television, but put down everyone who wants to change something.
Then there are the media, who want to rob you of your honour, and who confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let&#39;s talk about your visions.
You took up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retrospective asset declarations of over 20 million crowns.
To do that, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no authority in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislation.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As a common citizen, I campaigned for the guide to remain a free trade and this was achieved.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left comes up with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected and that only delays the populace.
As an independent non-partisan, I have far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country from any party without thinking in pigeonholes or party dogmas.
As a person in politics, do you see yourself more on the right or left?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me it is important that we progress.
I&#39;m not concerned with whether someone is on the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don&#39;t like it when someone calls you a populist.
But doesn&#39;t that confirm what you just said?
When you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to get closer to.
Call it populism if you like, but all the proposals I&#39;ve talked about are already working in the world, or have been discussed by key experts.
But without support in Parliament you are left with buzzwords.
And that won&#39;t get you very far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce material and criminal liability, for example?
I do not have another choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to achieve these goals.
As President, I would have no problem urging the leaders of parliamentary parties on live television to enshrine in law material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And those addressed would then have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality who points out grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I&#39;ll make it very clear that I&#39;m an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I&#39;m just getting into politics and I&#39;m trying to get majority support for my program.
I always try to judge things for myself; and if it doesn&#39;t work out, then in six years I&#39;ll go back into the private sector.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I can&#39;t achieve anything alone; so I spoke to several well-known personalities about running for the Senate as well.
For example, I talked to Radim Jančura, but he refused because he was overworked.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the trading of light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people were deeply dissatisfied, but now I&#39;m not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the polls at all, and those who did vote mostly voted for establishment officials.
In the Senate we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a composition of the Senate that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven&#39;t thought about that yet because I don&#39;t have the time or the money to check the past of every potential party member.
I don&#39;t even have money for the presidential campaign; there are only 20,000 CZK on my transparent account.
You do not have any money?
You&#39;re talking about declarations of assets, what would yours look like?
I estimate my personal wealth at around CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another one for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, worth about a million. And then I still have a few million in the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child&#39;s dream - I always liked James Bond, how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don&#39;t want to invest your own money in it.
That&#39;s not exactly convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I&#39;ve already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don&#39;t have any sponsors means that my program doesn&#39;t seem to attract too much interest.
And I am under no obligation to fund the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn&#39;t live on the senator&#39;s salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son&#39;s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn&#39;t run for anything.
So do you continue to be an entrepreneur to make a living?
Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;re going to scale back those activities?
But that has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I have partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan saving the republic.
But I also have to make a living from something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and it will continue to be so.
As President, however, I would cease my activities altogether.
For the full interview, see Saturday&#39;s Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the mind - with the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built book hill - 2 photos
&quot;I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic and finally there is something interesting to see again,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: &quot;Yes, it&#39;s nice, the house.&quot;
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
Nobody goes to one of those old-style libraries voluntarily anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town outside the gates of Rotterdam that hardly needs to be visited, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant municipality has the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that are shown on the euro notes as nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master the statistics: a library was needed!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architects&#39; office MVRDV, master of daring bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around in amazement and shrugging their shoulders, the cheeky Maas stacked his exquisite souvenirs according to size into a pyramid and ended his actionist-based speech with the words: &quot;Dear municipality!&quot;
So that&#39;s it, my suggestion for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain was heaped up.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the book mountain was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;.
The project has also been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small-town retort, which until then had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, is richer by a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Eldorado of books under a cheese dome.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true joys of space and reading are revealed when you climb the topography on foot.
The interior, which is glazed all around, is bright and clear, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public city square unmistakably.
The urban ambience is perfect.
One is already on the lookout for park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books, books.
&quot;Usually the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a big, dark room that&#39;s mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out.
The interior of the book hill is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and a building services center.
The black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes parapets, sometimes banisters, are a particular delight.
The look, feel and smell are alien.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
&quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials here,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard.
And so one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland farm.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root pad in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts for a season or two, after which it is ready for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in this quantity - into panels four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolours into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre hike, you will not only be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city in the literature café, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They create atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the book hill is under a glass dome, the sun only shines briefly into the interior, even on sunny days.
The wide laminated wood beams, which are perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shade and absorb a large part of the solar radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic roller blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse&#39;s &quot;long overdue soul&quot;.
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from their personal inventory.
This should initially fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully stocked - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled to the brim.
&quot;Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
&quot;I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some sort of relationship with this new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it&#39;s just for show.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the supreme discipline that is known in technical jargon as identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: &quot;Germans have to play a bigger role&quot;
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic degree.
DW: Earlier this week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the Palestinians&#39; application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it doesn&#39;t support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that&#39;s right.
This is because it is in the process of changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was sort of managed by the US, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They&#39;re expected to play a more independent role, but they&#39;re not used to it.
I think they&#39;re still feeling their way into their role, but they&#39;re on the way to a more &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Great Britain.
What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean specifically from a German perspective?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany&#39;s economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany needs to protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That&#39;s why you have to be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn&#39;t put too much weight on it either, it&#39;s not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relationship with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a lot of understanding for the German position in Europe and even in the US.
So I don&#39;t think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will even earn a certain amount of respect with it.
Because it signals that as an international player you have to be taken seriously and that your interests have to be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The USA, on the other hand, has clearly spoken out in favor of a veto.
Are there disagreements between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a bit of understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual disagreements are not as great as they seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not all that enthusiastic about Netanyahu&#39;s policies.
Is Germany finding it difficult to reconcile its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that&#39;s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can&#39;t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things from their own position.
That&#39;s what they&#39;re doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
Of course, that&#39;s not easy for Germany, if only because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans realize that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or is Germany still finding it difficult to lead?
Germany isn&#39;t used to it yet, it&#39;s still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany assumes a larger role, various anti-German sentiments are released.
That doesn&#39;t make it easy for the Germans.
That&#39;s actually the old problem: you don&#39;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It has to be receptive to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and that&#39;s not easy.
Now the influence of the USA in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don&#39;t like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even less popular - c&#39;est la vie!

&quot;Brand protection&quot; in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, as is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a name that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they will be right.
&quot;It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm who specializes in property right infringements in the Far East.
A new case lands on my desk every week.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark there, an artificial name that was also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
But Pattloch&#39;s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he takes action against Chinese companies being officially granted the right by the trademark office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this &quot;Bang Mingpai&quot;, a passenger brand.
The word is based on &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;.
This means women who lure rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
&quot;It&#39;s bad for business, you have to fight it,&quot; demands Pattloch.
&quot;The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous.&quot;
The financial losses and the process costs for the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
But deleting dubious entries in the trademark register is difficult to achieve and costs money.
The process can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because the name in question had become &quot;market reality&quot; after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he infringes his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with construction equipment manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired German concrete pump maker Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to Hong Kong and Singapore imitators who made the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient staff and space.
In the past year, however, the &quot;emergency situation in the work process has returned to normal&quot;.
The number of unprocessed objection cases has fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still waiting to be settled in the office.
It costs a lot to counteract this
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
That is a record and means that China tops the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth consecutive year, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were taken.
Put simply, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Tackling this costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
The company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans were able to get his illegal manufacture of imitation motor vehicle parts broken up.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We failed to do this ourselves, since family names cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the Munich-based company&#39;s objection.
Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, but the opposing party is still fighting to this day.
You have to be really careful
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot;
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archives even had to look through hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the other side a &quot;high six-digit euro amount&quot; for settlement.
&quot;That shows how much it&#39;s worth to us,&quot; says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spill back to Europe.
Namely, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
A Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
The group has long since given up this business area, but it was still able to avert the registration.
&quot;You have to be extremely careful,&quot; says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It&#39;s not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should &quot;register everything that is somehow worth protecting in China,&quot; as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg loses in the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the other party license fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: stomp, sing, help
The Imbongi choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg - and AIDS orphans in Swaziland are happy about it.
The story of a connection that covers more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women&#39;s pumps and men&#39;s slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One two three four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his smooth, wild gestures.
It&#39;s Monday evening and the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Around fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from human geneticists to househusbands.
&quot;Om&#39;Obani&quot; is not a simple piece, each choral part has a different text and it is in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland becomes.
Helping people help themselves
There are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide, according to estimates by Unaids, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
245,000 AIDS orphans live in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
You can sponsor a child for 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
Nobody in this room can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign, soft language and now and then takes them back to where they originally came from: in southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have their parents because they have succumbed to the HI virus.
Esitjeni shows on a small scale what all of Swaziland is suffering from: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to Unicef.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune deficiency virus, and dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, you don&#39;t really have a chance without a school-leaving certificate.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to give them a hot meal a day.
But just one year later, the choir founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot;, which since then has been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappiloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human pappilomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: Around 20 percent of new HIV infections are attributable to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In Germany, human pappiloma viruses are also common in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been falling since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2700 cases.
That is about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of an STD?
The infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary problems, discharge, abdominal pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infections and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend regular examinations, especially if you frequently change sex partners.
If diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and long-term effects avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees that the choir earns throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
&quot;In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, the association&#39;s chairwoman.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms are on time for school every day.
Those who have no one left come to the shelter with Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association along with the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized many in the village to have an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is across the country, people prefer to keep it silent.
A king with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot;
Actually strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, &quot;but they are hardly ever used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh.&quot;
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from the days of apartheid .
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings good spirits and joy, but has also wrested a few tears from some fierce border guards.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Hard to find on maps, the small village is well known in the Ezulweni River valley.
&quot;Go to Esitjeni, that&#39;s where the light is&quot; say the people there.
And when you return the 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Strasse, you can see it glowing there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is said to be possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Though it&#39;s closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
However, no one has linked the finding of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, the Messenger probe&#39;s chief scientist.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the finds could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earthlings, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to earth: small peepholes in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a &quot;planet&quot; according to the International Astronomical Union&#39;s new 2006 definition of the term.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, while the pink-colored &quot;newborns&quot; in the star circle room are more difficult to identify.
This star-forming region - unromantically dubbed W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years away.
This dazzling glow of a dying star was captured by NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made from material ejected by the star as it died.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope snapped this photo of the galactic birthplace.
Also known as &quot;The Seven Sisters,&quot; the Pleiades star cluster can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come into their own better.
Like a red Age, the Helix Nebula gazes out at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in all its beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images from the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years away, in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, divided into three), as dark streaks of dust bisect the glowing heart of the Star Birthplace.
In the constellation of the Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This stellar birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in spiral galaxy M83.
If you don&#39;t like technical abbreviations, you can call them by their nickname Southern Pinwheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
Located 1,400 light-years away, the nebula is made up of dust grains 10 to 100 times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was stitched together from optical and X-ray images from different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, dubbed Arp 273, was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is always producing new youngsters.
This star cloud, combined with the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominant in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have gotten bigger and bigger - and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap construction: The telescope is fixed in its elevation angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in elevation.
Its special feature: the high light-gathering power.
In spite of the comparatively small mirror diameter, this ranges close to that of the world&#39;s largest reflecting telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any computer owner can help with the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI) by making computing power available.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its primary mirror is said to be a whopping 42 meters - and made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures are not expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF to look up at the sky.
A new, huge telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it can be admired in an illustration.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The last preparations for launching the Kepler space telescope are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope&#39;s tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar readings have indicated there is ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to a biblical old age.
There&#39;s even a longevity museum.
A search for clues in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to a biblical old age.
There&#39;s even a longevity museum.
A search for clues in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the winding road, past densely forested hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Talysh people live, of whom not much is known, except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and are very long-lived.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town flaunts too bulky architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the journey from Azerbaijan&#39;s capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers because the road is only one lane.
The incredible wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
&quot;Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here,&quot; says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, arguably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talysh from the area who are older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120 years old.
Fathered another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have lived to the age of 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who lived to be 122, Müslümov&#39;s age seems extremely doubtful.
&quot;He was born here in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the very old in Central Asia.
&quot;There are also a striking number of very old people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz. &quot;There are also an extremely large number of very old men living in Sardinia.&quot;
Due to a lack of documents, however, no scientific proof of age could be provided, especially since there were no civil status registers.
Cups of melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people in the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many very old people live here in the south?
The Azerian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to the diet.
But that the high-calorie diet of the Talyschen, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, should be so healthy, does not seem particularly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik.
At 97, she is still comparatively young for this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter churn that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva&#39;s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, which is served in the typical, bulbous Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva&#39;s white teeth line up perfectly, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk so it never ran out and kept its color.
&quot;I never used shampoo either,&quot; says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She only ever ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never once bought groceries from the supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst after World War II.
But everything got better when &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman&#39;s mouth.
But the cult surrounding the nation&#39;s father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan&#39;s elderly.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (roughly the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount that is easy to live on by local standards.
And perhaps Mirzayeva&#39;s son, who has long since turned gray, is right: &quot;The elderly are held in high esteem in our culture.&quot;
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that&#39;s not a reason to stay alive as long as possible

We have to make the transition.
&quot;And that it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God,&quot; he said on state television.

Because all of them, so far hopelessly at odds in a confused opposition, are afraid.

Mohammed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the constitutional court and expanded its powers &quot;to save the revolution.&quot;
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are not sure about, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
Indeed, the 234 articles rattled through by the Islamist-dominated 100-strong Constituent Assembly in a late-night, 15-hour tour de force are in part troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judiciary is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law&quot;.
But what does &quot;principles&quot; mean?
That was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least that is what a newly added article suggests: Al-Ashar University, the country&#39;s most important Islamic institution with great influence on all of Sunni Islam, must be consulted on all matters relating to Sharia.
This does not have to be, but it can mean that the clergy oversees legislation, effectively incapacitating the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served to repress opposition figures during Mubarak&#39;s rule.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
According to the draft, the state should also protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote their morals and values&quot;.
This is legally so vaguely formulated that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
Incidentally, no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women.
For this, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what constitutes an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
The wording that &quot;insulting people&quot; is forbidden seems just as dubious.
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
It&#39;s a matter of interpretation, like so much in the draft that Morsi is ready to sign and which he says will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum &quot;very soon&quot;.
&quot;The revolution has returned&quot;
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual unity on Friday night in Cairo&#39;s Tahrir Square and vowed to overthrow the charter before it can come into force.
&quot;The revolution has returned and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution &quot;belongs on the garbage heap of history.&quot;
Via the short message service Twitter, he accused Morsi&#39;s supporters of wanting to lead a &quot;coup against democracy&quot;.
&quot;If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,&quot; opposition leader Jasser Said said.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced they would not oversee the referendum, rendering it invalid.
&quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot;
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew a counter-demonstration, to be on the safe side, not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafist supporters attended, shouting: &quot;The people demand the application of God&#39;s law.&quot;
They demanded of Morsi: &quot;Clean up the country!&quot; and affirmed: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot;
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked conditions similar to a civil war.
Morsi&#39;s supporters obviously didn&#39;t want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both those who opposed the draft constitution and those who supported it spoke out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists&#39; draft is considered certain.
&quot;The word human rights doesn&#39;t even appear&quot;
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this accelerated constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) has defended the Muslim Brotherhood as they were imprisoned and on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
&quot;And now the word human rights isn&#39;t even in the new constitution,&quot; he complained in an interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
Mursi&#39;s extension of power to all three branches of the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto disabling it,&quot; Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which views the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protester on Tahrir warns: &quot;You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control.&quot;
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world&#39;s foulest smelling fish?
Norway&#39;s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
Could the country&#39;s secret to success have something to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp gym clothes.
And leave her there for a week.
This is roughly how you imagine the nose-deafening smell of rakfisk, one of Norway&#39;s great delicacies.
I&#39;m in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There&#39;s snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just won&#39;t go away.
Rakfisk is salted trout that&#39;s fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you like your fish.
In Norway, when darkness descends and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, very impressive specialty.
&quot;You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station but also organizes the festival as a so-called &quot;rakfisk general&quot;.
All around us, people are eating small cubes of fish and consuming large amounts of alcohol.
&quot;Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk,&quot; says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I taste some appetizers.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to your nose, it&#39;s not bad - kind of like sushi, which has had quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in the autumn.
Then, in the depths of winter, after long fermentation, it was taken out and consumed - no doubt with the senses dulled by alcohol.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, migrating mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving job market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Immigrants are pouring in even from Sweden, the old rival, which not too long ago was far wealthier than Norway.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, albeit pungent, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes that you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros.
Norway doesn&#39;t often make the world press, and most people don&#39;t seem to mind.
Here they still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - the racist right-wing extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, reference is made only to the &quot;July 22 Incident&quot;.
Norwegians have a hard time accepting that anyone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main reason for Norway&#39;s current prosperity since the early 1970s has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
&quot;But oil isn&#39;t the only reason we&#39;re doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, who hands out round trays of ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are a - how do you say - prudent people.
Her English, like that of most people here, is impeccable.
We&#39;re not very boastful, we don&#39;t like boasting.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - much of the industry&#39;s earnings are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone was throwing around money they didn&#39;t have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
&quot;As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we&#39;re happy,&quot; says Anna.
&quot;And of course eat rakfisk,&quot; she adds with a lighthearted laugh.
I&#39;m standing in the snow queuing for another dish - I&#39;ve had enough of rakfisk.
A moose burger is definitely something different. I like the juicy meat.
But in the evening the stinky fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I&#39;m staying at is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best -- or perhaps most olfactorily challenging -- fish.
There is a live TV feed to a bow tie clad host surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
&quot;What&#39;s your score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?&quot;
&quot;Here are our points, Havard&quot;.
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it&#39;s the severe haze of the whole fish after all.
Mexico&#39;s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico&#39;s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC&#39;s Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
This is a perpetually congested city even on better days, but a ring of steel was erected on Monday, sealing off several major transport routes into the capital and wreaking havoc on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico&#39;s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential armband and take over leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Mexico has fared well economically under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
&quot;My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence,&quot; Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before he was on an equal footing with the US President, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new head of state are divided in this densely populated, sprawling part of the country surrounding the capital.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Residents of the resort credit him with developing tourism and building infrastructure.
To reach the city one can drive on one of the highways built by Pena Nieto, which are a great improvement on the broken, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive climate change museum.
&quot;We expect real and lasting change from him,&quot; said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
Vicente Fox replaced the PRI in 2000 after 81 years in power.
Congressman Olvera admits the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace.
He rejects the opposition&#39;s accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Tucked under freeway overpasses, the place is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucially urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a patch of wasteland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, notorious for its violence and murder of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the issue of femicide during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has turned a blind eye to the problem.
In a concrete building typical of the seedy neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights back tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
&quot;When I got to her house, it seemed like her body had been washed,&quot; recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs she was being beaten and rigor mortis had already set in.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross bearing a single word: Justice.
But this, according to the family, has been denied her until now.
The authorities treated me like I was a talker, a troublemaker, a nag.
They want you to just accept their judgment and shut up.
&quot;But that&#39;s not possible when there were so many formal errors and omissions,&quot; she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential armband on Saturday, he also assumes a great deal of responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to pay special attention to the problem during his term in office.
&quot;I hope as president he&#39;s like he was as governor,&quot; says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors allege Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse
Prosecutors have denied Bradley Manning&#39;s allegations that he was abused in prison
The hearing addresses Manning&#39;s time in the Quantico, Virginia military prison
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the charges on the grounds that the prison conditions were too harsh
The US Army private is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
Prosecutors on Friday tried to determine that Army Private Bradley Manning - charged with the largest disclosure of classified information in US history - missed several opportunities to complain about alleged mistreatment in military custody.
When cross-examining Manning during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, told Maj. Ashden Fein that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning&#39;s nine-month incarceration at Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The day before cross-examination, held following a motion by the defense to dismiss the charges, saying Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh incarceration, Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At Friday&#39;s hearing, Fein reviewed forms with Manning that officials filled out after meeting Manning while he was in detention at Quantico Military Penitentiary, where he was held under enhanced conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him about the forms Friday, Manning admitted that he found the treatment by his guards &quot;excellent&quot; and the facility&#39;s overall treatment &quot;very professional.&quot;
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints of ill-treatment, although officers questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed his concerns and that officers had discussed them with him and said they were looking into them. However, they were not logged.
&quot;They wrote down &#39;no problems&#39; (after discussing the concerns), and that didn&#39;t necessarily mean I didn&#39;t say anything at all,&quot; Manning said.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 with a committee set to investigate suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form several months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to have his watch status downgraded to &quot;prevention of injury&quot;.
The military said they gave him this restrictive status - one level below suicidal - for his own protection and that of others.
&quot;I wanted to convince employees that I was fine and get rid of the injury prevention observation status (...) in order to be able to achieve what I felt was a better quality of life,&quot; said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he contemplated suicide in Kuwait and once fell unconscious due to the heat.
Not being able to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was stressful.
&quot;My world shrunk to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,&quot; Manning said Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving because sleeping or even lying down was forbidden during the day.
He always had to sleep with the light coming into his cell from outside.
When he turned over at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning&#39;s attorney formally objected to Manning&#39;s treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Military Penitentiary.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about an allegation he made in his testimony Thursday -- that he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico one night and stood naked in front of guards and other inmates at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he never had an opportunity to wrap himself in his blanket during that count.
When questioned Friday, Manning said he deduced an order from his guard to drop the blanket he might have been using to cover himself. However, he admitted that no one asked him to do it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer he could have used the waistband of his briefs or flip-flops to hurt himself, but didn&#39;t do so.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his prison experience into account and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at the court-martial. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses while other charges deemed too extreme will be appealed.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend. The public prosecutor is expected to justify the prison conditions.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was being held under the terms applicable to all detainees held under the highest security at Quantico.
Charges against Manning include abetting the enemy, illegally posting intelligence information online, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If found guilty of all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - reminding them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just walked through the concourse and arrived at passport control when I became perplexed.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for &quot;Mexicanos&quot; (&quot;Mexicans&quot;), another for &quot;Extranjeros&quot; (&quot;Foreigners&quot;).
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which to go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called &quot;Mexican&quot; my entire life.
An ethnic acronym - just like my friends in Boston call themselves &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York call themselves &quot;Italian&quot;.
Later I settled on &quot;Mexican-American&quot;.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather&#39;s homeland there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to hold my own in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don&#39;t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can&#39;t shake my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I reflected on that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues one expects when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of Mexico&#39;s economy. It&#39;s one reason Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico&#39;s war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details on the matter.
Mexico&#39;s relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with resentment.
Most Americans probably never give a second thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country&#39;s leaders at gunpoint to cede more than half of their territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than minutes, memories of this event are unmissable.
So whenever a US official expresses even the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the country&#39;s elites - about how Americans are encroaching on their neighboring country&#39;s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
And yet, in truth, Mexico&#39;s greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person - maybe a parent or grandparent - didn&#39;t stand a chance in Mexico was commanded and emigrated north.
And in most cases, that person fit a profile - black, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of those people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American dream, have gone to good schools and gotten good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living - not the Mexican dream.
Our identities may be fuzzy at times, but when it comes to our loyalty, that&#39;s not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican elite do not like us.
This is mutual.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us for not being Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
According to them, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn&#39;t failed in Mexico, they wouldn&#39;t have left.
And then we wouldn&#39;t find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain, living comfortably in the United States but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent that .
While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican-Americans I know feel they don&#39;t belong in either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, yet is not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we&#39;re seen as Mexicans.
As I was to learn during my journey, there is something that further complicates this relationship: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educated middle class wish to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican-Americans as makeshift &quot;ambassadors&quot; for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
So.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And with the unequal distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren&#39;t sure it&#39;s a great country.
I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to go through this alone, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans harbor resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we&#39;re more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual finger-pointing, countless buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed -- and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have landed near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem .
But even as Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there&#39;s reason to believe the deadly standoff may finally be coming to an end.
A war that will be neither lost nor won
At first glance, given the current situation, optimism seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 holds, this week&#39;s fighting has strengthened the hardened on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis even as his group has suffered heavy casualties.
Despite killing several Hamas leaders and cramming Gaza&#39;s 1.7 million residents into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to crush Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders may decide that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has attracted powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once seen as Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as has Qatar, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah is in power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist strain may be poised to overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on Israel&#39;s southern flank has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years before being overthrown in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is related to Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may prove to be an actor that even Israel and the United States cannot push out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli anti-missile defense system, &quot;Iron Dome&quot;, has proved its worth and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
Diplomatically, the United States remains steadfast in its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, thanks in no small part to the Separation Barriers running into the West Bank, the main body of an eventual Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law, but are still being expanded.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party has allied itself with an even more combative group under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the Jan. 22 elections.
Why coddle these insidious Palestinians too and give them their own state?
If they were indeed in control of the West Bank, wouldn&#39;t they be launching rockets just like their comrades in Gaza?
No, it&#39;s better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them should they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail. But the Arab Spring could throw a spanner in the works.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel, their first focus will be on troubles at home.
Israel&#39;s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will do little to help the new Arab governments repair their economies.
That the pragmatic President Morsi joined forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be an auspicious sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer term.
As the rest of the Arab world takes tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will no doubt one day explode in the Israeli-held territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and as the Arab population grows, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in Gaza will take an increasing diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an outside push
The correct answer is the one espoused by the saner proponents of both sides, most of the rest of the world, and this newspaper: two states where Israel is ceding territory for security purposes.
The hope - small for the foreseeable future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, along with Turkey and Qatar, must now halt arms shipments to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to challenge Hamas on the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by swaps and a shared Jerusalem convince.
Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to come to an agreement.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do his part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems he&#39;s equally averse to involvement.
But that is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian Uniform Cigarette Packaging Laws come into effect
Health warnings and diseased body parts on plain green pack common to all tobacco brands
The world&#39;s first legislation for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging has come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing diseased body parts and infants and children sickened by cigarette smoke.
Aside from the different health warnings and images, as of next Saturday the only difference between the packs will be the brand names printed in identical, small font.
With this, Australia introduces the world&#39;s strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government is basing this on studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking by the age of 26 have a 99% chance of not starting again after that.
&quot;You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to advertise with their brand image,&quot; said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a logo&#39;s crown with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on multinationals&#39; profits, other countries are already considering similar moves.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said the laws would encourage black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
&quot;The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,&quot; says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be offering far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that since the groups British American Tobacco, Britain&#39;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco joined forces two months ago, demand for cigarette cases and silicon lids to cover the unbearable packaging has surged failed at the Australian Supreme Court in their challenge to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stock.
It&#39;s good business for us.
Experts say the catch in the popularity of social media lies with the very demographic the plan is targeting.
A series of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from sponsoring sports and forced most retailers to stop displaying cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has moved to the internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no control over international sites.
&quot;Anyone who markets tobacco and only has a small area left to promote their products cannot avoid the internet,&quot; says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noticed a surge in brand reviews from &quot;ordinary people.&quot;
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private individual who takes a liking to Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or is a marketing agency involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on grappling with the new laws rather than marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although neither country has major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada became the first country to mandate photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
&quot;You just take a cigarette butt and put the pack away,&quot; says Victor El Hage when buying a pack of cigarettes that has a photo of a mouth tumor printed on it.
Honestly there&#39;s only one reason I would quit and that&#39;s my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to restock his shelves.
&quot;It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now it takes me four,&quot; says Yu.
&quot;The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that&#39;s it, we&#39;re closing down,&quot; he adds, clearly angry.
In a constantly electrified world, it&#39;s nice to be bored
I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport this Thanksgiving when our plane was down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to think about boredom a bit.
i don&#39;t wanna lie
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But a growing number of academics and child development experts are citing boredom as a positive thing.
As far as they&#39;re concerned, we - and our kids - are okay with the occasional boredom.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us are staring at one screen or another almost constantly these days, we&#39;re no longer reaping the benefits of boredom.
So should we embrace boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I&#39;ll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved as free time has increased.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011), disagrees.
&quot;In fact, boredom has a very long history,&quot; he says.
The walls of Pompeii are decorated with Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After extensive reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of &quot;wanting to do something satisfying but being unable to do it&quot;. .
Thus, boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a &quot;disruption in the attentional process coupled with a bad mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly.&quot;
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we&#39;re bored when we&#39;re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study, &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume so that it was barely audible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
Those listening to the barely audible television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn&#39;t find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulty to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, disrupting attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study&#39;s authors.
On the other hand, if you&#39;re engaged in a monotonous activity - &quot;like searching for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract you and help you not feel bored&quot;.
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually combat it by keeping people more physically alert.
&#39;Studies have shown that children who are allowed to jump around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,&#39; says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a blaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a &quot;boredom proneness scale&quot; in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as &quot;Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;I have so many interests that I don&#39;t have enough time for everything&quot;.
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida -- particularly when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty weary bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they weren&#39;t at school.
Yet only 3% of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says now, 21 years later, he doesn&#39;t know if the percentages of boredom have gone up or down.
However, he is certain that &quot;young people are perceived as particularly boring&quot;, mainly because children and teenagers do not have much of an impact on their everyday lives.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and turn to gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors study the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
&quot;With boredom, your brain is trying to tell you that you should be doing something else,&quot; said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn&#39;t always know what&#39;s best to do at the moment.
When you&#39;re bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you become happy.
But television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, but these evaporate again in the long term.
So if you hand your bored child an iPad, you can use it to dissuade them from boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: &quot;Self-control carries over from one situation to another&quot;.
The child not only learns how to converse, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don&#39;t think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant spree of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
&quot;It sounds like we need to be bored more often. But boredom is the nagging, incessant desire to do something meaningful,&quot; he says.
He believes the truth is that people are just looking for a way to switch off and relax.
&quot;In an environment where we&#39;re constantly overstimulated, it&#39;s hard to keep busy once the noise has died down.&quot;
In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new marijuana law
19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeast Colorado for a soon-to-be-legal offense in that state: possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were pulled over.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia -- petty offenses each carrying a $100 fine -- and given a court date.
&quot;We are treated like criminals,&quot; said Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the state&#39;s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of infractions involving marijuana are already being dropped here and in Washington state, which has authorized similar measures.
Police authorities are no longer prosecuting adults over the age of 21 for small-scale possession. This will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado&#39;s more conservative counties have said they will pursue existing marijuana charges and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains, are voting to block new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
&quot;This situation is evolving so rapidly that I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads at a loss.
They are awaiting guidance on establishing a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of December 1, 2013 in mind.
In any event, Washington believes Colorado is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation. There the drug was legalized first for medical purposes and then for personal use.
&quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so it&#39;s a good place to be in the state,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Regulatory Agency.
But Smith also acknowledges that no site or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
&quot;We don&#39;t have any real precedent to follow,&quot; he adds.
Washington law, dubbed I-502, goes into effect December 6, marking the end of a gray area where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And uncomfortable practical issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how to reconcile the government requirement of &quot;reasonable access&quot; to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis businesses within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
&quot;Nowhere will finding a location for a licensed cannabis business be harder than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,&quot; said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Chief Oates emailed his staff in Aurora, stating that the district attorney would no longer be prosecuting minor marijuana use cases involving people over the age of 21, and that &quot;effective immediately&quot; the police will not be pursuing criminal charges for these offenses .
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce city regulations regulating medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a tougher view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, primarily to encourage users to quit.
Currently, 119 people are on trial for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other offenses as well.
&quot;Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offenses at the time,&quot; Buck said in a statement.
Reactions have been mixed, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county&#39;s largest city, are no longer reporting adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision, but also chose not to drop all pending possession cases.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,&quot; he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters backed the measure, it was clear from the start that reconciling personal marijuana use with government and legal complexities would not be easy.
And the conflicting responses across the state exposed a profound dichotomy among local officials about the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a &quot;cultural barrier,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents defendants on trial for marijuana offenses and serves as a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
&quot;They&#39;ve spent so much of their life prosecuting people for it that they still can&#39;t accept legalization,&quot; he says.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being touted as national paragons for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials prepare for an era of legal sales, they also anxiously await direction from the federal government that will continue to criminalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level.
Proponents of the legalization movement are hoping the Justice Department will relent.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has largely legalized the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while law enforcement officers are unlikely to kick down doors to seize small quantities of the drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to use state-regulated marijuana, which is legal under the new legislation - to tolerate business.
Several Colorado cities are not even waiting for federal authorities to act.
Before Election Day, some local government agencies approved moratoriums on new marijuana stores, though they may not open for about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a western city, passed a six-month ban that is likely to be passed next week.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to get into a position where we license somebody and then we have a big problem at the federal level,&quot; said Bob Nicholson, member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
We act according to what the community has decided, not what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford for being Tory
It&#39;s not just today&#39;s university students who are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had attended what I once thought to be the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium promoting the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of moving into Worscester College in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study history, I had packed my bags again, creating the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the next room.
Author AN Wilson mischievously explained that I dropped out of college because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
i ran away
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been harassed for only one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I had been a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of students from the moderate right are suffering similar persecution.
Organized and growing hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now reached such proportions that a group last week called for equal equal rights protections for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College&#39;s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are &quot;often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable&quot; because of their political views.
They are demanding a place on their college&#39;s equality committee to ensure their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recent BBC Two documentary about political students, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the Conservative Oxford University Student Union, driving a Rolls-Royce and sporting a silver suit and silver-studded cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as &quot;scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees.&quot;
20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the University of Nottingham&#39;s Conservative Students&#39; Union, told a Sunday newspaper: &quot;There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People think we&#39;re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.&quot;
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who initiated the petition for greater protection, says such a climate is &quot;uncomfortable&quot;. 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of Oxford&#39;s Conservative Students&#39; Union, says she&#39;s seen growing resentment among JCR members towards students from the moderate right.
&quot;This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members,&quot; she says.
In my first weeks at Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
I arrived in September 1986 as an incredibly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
Last year the university voted not to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have alarmed even Stalinists.
In the early days of freshman week, as new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what was to come.
It was my experience that tutors not only condoned, but happily participated in, the taunting of Tory students.
Political issues such as the miners&#39; strike, privatization and the government&#39;s opposition to sanctions against South Africa&#39;s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
My first such event was to translate 18th-century French texts into English. I wasn&#39;t prepared for what was to come next.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
I stumbled.
Pitt was a short man with a face like cake batter, and quite spiteful.
&quot;Are Thatcher supporters refusing to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; he asked me.
The other students giggled.
Tears welled up in my eyes.
&quot;I suggest you take some French lessons in your spare time - well, if you&#39;re not too busy with your social activities,&quot; Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging low.
That night I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone tapped me lightly on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student union.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said gently.
Unfortunately it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It&#39;s bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be Labor Party supporters.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman student of philosophy, politics and economics who ironically attended Eton College, which is considered conservative, said to me: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig&quot;.
you are polluted
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
&quot;How do Tories have sex?&quot; one asked me.
They hit each other, don&#39;t they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal laws in the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I only be able to meet like-minded people after dark?
Should I turn to Labor and have to repress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead stretched in my mind&#39;s eye into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a contemporary history professor based at my college.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist perspective on history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You won&#39;t be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents&#39; house, finding refuge with more open-minded friends and family in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his forties all political views were accepted.
&quot;But it&#39;s the best place in the world,&quot; he said sheepishly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spiers.
Even my communist friends always displayed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes clouded over.
Give it a chance.
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re just being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted from my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had given in to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was &quot;an enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly embarrassed, I admitted that my parents had &quot;brainwashed&quot; me, calling them &quot;old suckers.&quot;
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he was writing two columns a week for the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room and after five minutes my captors gave up.
When they left I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Feel free to call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer such intimidation and viciousness in an educational setting.
More tragically, it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers but to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to fame&quot;
ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion house in celebration of the &#39;Valentino - Master of Couture&#39; exhibition, which opened in London this week.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition dedicated to Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of &quot;Valentino - Master of Couture&quot;, a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his &quot;maison&quot; over the last 50 years were assembled.
&quot;I love this palace,&quot; he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of aristocracy.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3rd, there is a multitude of private letters and photographs signed by the finest aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from humble fashion designer in the northern Italian town of Voghera to idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
&quot;At least they&#39;re not kicking their butts out on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop-music celebrities do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
&quot;We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad,&quot; explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a Valentino dress
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza hasn&#39;t forgotten the fashion designer&#39;s charisma either.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his influence in every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music.
&quot;Everyone invited felt important and loved,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model,&quot; who began her career at Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
&quot;He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art,&quot; she concludes.
fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of mutual love.
He likes well-bred people with the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-meter catwalk that proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and walks the catwalk to admire a dreamlike &quot;audience&quot; wearing Valentino masterpieces , such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristóteles Onassis, the suits worn by Monica Vitti in &quot;La Notte&quot; or a wool and leather coat that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
Names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg shine in this audience of fashion dolls.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that their first Valentino is like their first love, &quot;unforgettable&quot;.
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a &quot;Gillette&quot; type waistcoat, and a jacket from the Fall/Winter 1971-1972 collection.
&quot;It was a gift from him,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the designer&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he enhances our beauty,&quot; adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion opinion leader Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg can&#39;t forget the first time she wore a Valentino either.
Living in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
It finally came about in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin Prince Edouard de Ligne&#39;s castle.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped bodice with a cleavage that lives up to its name.
&quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says Rodrigo d&#39;Arenberg&#39;s widow.
&quot;Valentino doesn&#39;t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,&quot; explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D&#39;Arenberg keeps her evening dresses from the fashion designer &quot;with absolute care&quot;, &quot;because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it&quot;.
The &quot;king&quot; of fashion
The grand finale to the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress for her marriage to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different types of embroidery and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority on the specialized press, this dress was a milestone in late 20th century haute couture, &quot;the return to the customers of high society&quot;.
Marred for years with the &quot;savoir-être&quot; of the elite, Valentino is now their finest example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy&#39;s highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients&#39; husbands.
&quot;I&#39;ve always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance,&quot; admits D&#39;Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
&quot;He was spotless; time leaves no mark on him&quot;.
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell and others literally work in hell.
Such is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must descend every day to the bottom of his crater, where the sulphurous gas escaping from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders down the sloping stone paths.
It&#39;s only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2,386 meters, but it takes the exhausted porters more than 40 minutes to climb at a turtle pace, balancing and stepping carefully. so they don&#39;t slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost her life, as happened to a French tourist who fell on the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists, who take pictures of them like circus monkeys, and walk three kilometers with the tiringly heavy baskets to the scales, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has exploited the deposits in the volcano and (never put it better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
She then sells these to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
&quot;Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who normally does three trips a day.
It takes him three hours each way, after which he&#39;s exhausted, but at the end of the day he&#39;s saved 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such inhumane effort is three times what he would earn working in the fields.
&quot;The daily wages of the miners here, where the coffee harvest is 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is 2 million rupees (167 euros), is very high,&quot; explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer the tourist island of Bali.
There he was earning 75,000 rupees a day and the work wasn&#39;t that hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulfur is: &quot;I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam&quot;.
Anto has asthma, is breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated from the toxic gases.
For three years now, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left its mark on him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, is breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated from the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
&quot;I&#39;ll work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than acceptable English.
This likeable and intelligent, but life-strung young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead he does the work of a donkey.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up at 2 a.m. every morning because the sulfur emanates even at night, where its distinctive yellow color glistens bluish in the dark.
Defying the shadows, he descends into the crater by the light of a small headlamp on his helmet that he bought with his own money.
Around 400 porters load baskets of sulfur onto their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the porters, who work on their own account and are paid by the weight.
They also do not get a share of the 30,000 rupees ($2.5) surcharge per camera that the wardens of this nature park, along with the 15,000 rupees ($1.2) entrance fee, charge tourists to take photos of the volcano and of human donkeys come.
&quot;This work is for the animals, not for humans,&quot; protests Madrusin, a burly, 42-year-old porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to carry up to 110kg, he says he will continue &quot;as long as he can&quot; because he needs the money to raise his three children, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns your throat and your eyes itch, if the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so tough that nobody complains of serious illnesses ... except for them, of course the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and blisters on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions quarry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks along a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to retire, I&#39;m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,&quot; explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, at 30, also works as a sulfur porter.
Time goes by, but the misery continues for generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human pack donkeys at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame not having children on careers, the stress and expense of real estate, and raising children.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population needs to grow.&quot;
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: Let&#39;s do our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a mint advert, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of it - it went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song that uses local sayings such as B. &quot;Will put a &quot;bao&quot; (loaf) in the oven to poke fun at Singapore&#39;s low birth rate.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, is hoping that the commercial will be a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their &quot;national duty&quot;.
This is a web-only thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We&#39;re the worst people in the world at procreation, so we felt it was an issue we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as B. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (quick flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like B. to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore is not taking this issue lightly.
Each year she spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia also known for the conservatism of its rulers and strict social controls.
According to its national population agency, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren&#39;t Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Bureau, says this is due to &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;greater career opportunities.&quot;
&quot;This has allowed people to have a lot more options and priorities in terms of life goals, besides getting married and having a family,&quot; she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and the delay in marriage and childbirth, the result of which is the reduction in Singapore&#39;s fertility rate.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counteract the declining population provoked resentment among the local populace.
In Singapore, there are websites where thinly disguised xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The surge in immigration is also believed to be one of the reasons Singapore&#39;s ruling party had its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to rectify the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known effects on a nation&#39;s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policies, the Singapore example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Agency has begun controlling the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoeboxes,&quot; that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and are a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the single person lifestyle and discourage builders from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate firm EL Developers, says his &quot;shoeboxes&quot; are selling much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger condominium units.
As a result, they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer guidance to developers who previously faced obstacles when trying to build too many small dwelling units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birthrate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district suggest they won&#39;t have much of an impact.
&quot;People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why many people put it off,&quot; says a young manager.
The children can have others.
&quot;It&#39;s important for me to have my own money and time,&quot; says another man in his twenties.
Men and women cite careers, the stress and expense of property and parenting as reasons for not being able to have children.
That&#39;s why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - there&#39;s so much the government can do about that.
The offline private offline is online private
privacy
According to the dictionary, this is private, or &quot;that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any form of interference&quot;.
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposing himself to by posting situations online that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who surf the web frequently.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with &quot;something very personal&quot; on a personal level and &quot;on the password and the user&quot; when applied to the social networks.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t share my deepest secrets in a post,&quot; says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of &quot;private&quot; on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he&#39;s had accounts for the past two years has.
&quot;These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world,&quot; he confirms.
On FB I upload nice pictures or pictures of games.
I also pass the time with acquaintances.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t share a photo that isn&#39;t of me, or of someone making a fool of it,&quot; he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of nudity, of crime, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if anyone will answer me, I&#39;m just uploading them,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to distant relatives or friends,&quot; he says.
When asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits he doesn&#39;t know 20 of the people he&#39;s added to his friends list.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t scare me because we have something in common, like music,&quot; he says.
According to the boy, no one hinted at him or asked for his address or phone number.
&quot;If someone hassles me or asks me to, I just remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
José reached out to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
&quot;He never found out who it was,&quot; he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
&quot;He just did it privately.&quot;
He then explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I didn&#39;t like him or wanted to get one over on him.
&quot;But I know this is cyberbullying,&quot; he explains.
key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
&quot;The Internet was born as a medium for finding information, but the rules of the game have changed with the appearance of these sites,&quot; she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master&#39;s degree in education from Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
They are the digital natives, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
&quot;We&#39;re the digital immigrants they&#39;re supposed to teach when we&#39;re still learning,&quot; he says.
He explains that it&#39;s a complex issue, &quot;because we ask them to have a defined criterion about what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where the maturity to do so is not sufficient. &quot;
&quot;They should also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people about privacy is to ask them thought-provoking questions.
&quot;Telling them not to do it doesn&#39;t work,&quot; he says.
Porras then gives some possibilities: There are things you wouldn&#39;t tell a stranger. Then why are you doing it on the internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone published a photo of you like the one you published of a friend?
Do you know what other people publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before tagging photos of celebrations?
And one more question: does everyone need to know what you&#39;re doing in every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must trade online as they do offline.
It&#39;s the same rules.
&quot;Someone off the internet is acting with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must be true on social media,&quot; he explains.
monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read social media guidelines carefully.
If you understand all of the sections, you will have a solid foundation for talking to your kids about the importance of opening an online account.
&quot;For example, the age, or what you can share or publish,&quot; he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson &quot;Thou shalt not speak to strangers.&quot;
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASU) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to get access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary session of Unasur heads of state and government. Sources in the State and Presidential Offices initially said they would hand it over after the retreat, but later said it would be published on the Peruvian government&#39;s website at some point.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the contents were presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists&#39; access to information about the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, the press room only broadcast the image of the presidential meeting with no sound, with the message &quot;private session, limited audio&quot;.
What little information circulated among the journalists was obtained from the press officers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press officer.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating Presidents, causing uneasiness among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
After that, the Office of the President of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the &quot;closing statement&quot; of the summit, but it was the Humala statement and not the official closing document of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III. South America - Arab States (ASPA) Summit, and on that occasion too, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not published either, despite press calls from the press.
On the official website of the ASPA one can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were in place, but severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling from the Hague Court of Justice settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the ICJ&#39;s decision, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago, the to hear pleas from both sides.
&quot;We will follow and carry out the ruling on the differences that we are presently bringing to this international court,&quot; Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts,&quot; added Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries .
Confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered a grave error, brought a lawsuit against the Bogotá Accords, in which it agreed to abide by the subject to the judgments of this international court.
Present at the summit were the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, saying that 16 decisions had been made and lines of action had been set for 31 projects between South American countries with a total investment of $17 billion.
Referring to the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries &quot;will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which end we are expanding the decisions on residence rights.&quot;
He said that measures would be taken to &quot;improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organized transnational crime, as well as measures to provide access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters&quot;.
With the crisis in Europe, &quot;economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but serve to expand our productive capacity and offer our peoples a better future,&quot; added Humala.
&quot;We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects that aim to improve spatial connections in South America, particularly in rural and border areas...thus uniting our countries and opening up new economies,&quot; said the Peruvian President in a statement read statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvian ones, lying on the transverse axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which are designed to provide better communication with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its re-admission into the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity, peace and good neighborly relations was another issue emphasized at the Summit.
In this sense, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that he was expecting a meeting on Saturday in Mexico with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to discuss the maritime conflict after one of Bogotá in treat the ICJ judgment in question with respect.
&quot;I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We will review all these avenues - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary,&quot; he underlined.
&quot;I hope to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilly and respectfully as possible,&quot; added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to attend the inauguration of that country&#39;s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc&#39;s defense ministers also met ahead of time to approve the action plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru temporarily chairs the regional bloc.
&quot;South America has to learn from the integration of its citizens,&quot; says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal whereby &quot;South America can actually learn something from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans &quot;killed each other in World War II and other conflicts&quot; and &quot;now have practically one fatherland are.&quot;
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that the member states of the Unasur are promoting.
&quot;Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that want to go back to the past,&quot; he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who signed the San Jose Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
&quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights should be based in Washington and funded by the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had followed his &quot;deep democratic values and views on human rights&quot;.
He added that at the time there were &quot;reasonable suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his process would not be followed.&quot;
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for an alleged sex offense, while &quot;Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference, which could have been carried out through the Ecuadorian embassy in London.&quot;
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange&#39;s health and mental state would be affected.
&quot;I haven&#39;t spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not serious,&quot; said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and mental harm because he is trapped in a confined space and cannot do outdoor physical exercises.
&quot;It would affect everyone&#39;s health,&quot; he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was to be granted a charter allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that talks had been held with London to find a solution for the imprisoned WikiLeaks founder.
We don&#39;t deal with human rights, we don&#39;t use that word in this case, but there were constant discussions.
&quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange&#39;s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a number of cases at various European courts,&quot; he explained.
And &quot;if Britain grants that carte blanche tomorrow, I think that&#39;s done.&quot;
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish case law allows and has done in other cases, the problem would be settled.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate &quot;is the mediocrity, bad faith and lying that undermine freedom of expression.&quot;
&quot;The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail,&quot; he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer ruled by such journalists &quot;nor by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries&quot; and anticipated that if re-elected he would &quot;deepen the revolution, to pave the way to this continue in the right direction.&quot;
Correa also backed the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism &quot;must remain firm and refrain from opportunism and coups disguised as legal&quot; because it would &quot;deny the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed.&quot;
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favored Nicaragua&#39;s maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries as &quot;absolutely justified .&quot;
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be addressed comprehensively so that one can overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that &quot;it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh .&quot;
Referring to the possibility of standing as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to obtain his third consecutive mandate, he indicated that he &quot;sees this possibility with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult falls.&quot;
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would retire from political life.
Personally, power has never interested me, but in circumstances as unjust as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
&quot;My political movement had the belief that it was me who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to live up to that responsibility,&quot; he said.
If I win, it will be my last term as President, after which I will retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
&quot;That&#39;s decided,&quot; he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez&#39;s health problems in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he went there for scheduled, routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
&quot;In no way does it mean a relapse in the health of President Chávez,&quot; he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader attended the 6th Union of South American Nations (Unasur) Heads of State and Government Summit in Lima today, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Today, the cause of death from AIDS is late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
&quot;It was like a bomb went off,&quot; he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor &quot;tried to weaken&quot; with no apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and started educating himself about it; and with such commitment that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was admitted in 1994 after several fights.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990&#39;s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, &quot;because it led to a dead end.&quot;
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic unaware of their disease, already damaged by the virus and depleted of their immune system, and victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appeared in the world, ie after the appearance of the first reported cases, &quot;the great achievement today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same&quot;, explained HCG HIV unit head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was backed up by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious disease and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, years of survival and quality of life depend on the level of impairment in individuals&#39; immune systems at the onset of the disease Treatment depended, and that those who were not drug dependent had greater odds: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years with a 500 CD4 count.
Put simply, the above means that if you are diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, in this sense &quot;you can live to 75 without any problems, as long as you are under control&quot;, explained this specialist.
To appreciate this progress, it is important to remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA Annual Report)), it is still true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and as of May this year there have been 187 deaths; however, it is asserted that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the medicines. The problem is that because they do not know their state of infection, people come at a very advanced stage, ie at very late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a concomitant infection. Impacting global mortality requires earlier diagnosis, which is why detection testing is being offered massively to all those who need it must.&quot;
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test done at a private laboratory, agree with this proposal and this from the only reason because it was done by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don&#39;t want to hear anything.
&quot;If I have to die, I&#39;d rather burst three times,&quot; they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
&quot;I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person,&quot; lists Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate them with his testimony who are scared today as part of World AIDS Day.
You should take the test if you belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV positive the better, and if they already know the diagnosis they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and ordinary people, explains Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who has taken on the HIV cause.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, &quot;the distribution of condoms has actually increased; before they were given out one by one, now they give us packages of a hundred, which is good, but there are still people who don&#39;t have access to a condom&quot; , he said.
Young people are among those at risk of new infections.
&quot;What do you need these for?&quot; is a common taunt from social workers, school guidance workers, pharmacy workers and health care workers that young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent asserted.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not just be behind the counter, but in dispensers in public toilets in establishments frequented by young people.
Promiscuity should not be encouraged.
They shouldn&#39;t be paid for the beer and motel, Governor Emilio González replied when asked if condoms would be distributed under his administration.
&quot;Sexuality doesn&#39;t look like that; it&#39;s best to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity,&quot; he said.
Key dates from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally for new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th for HIV.
92% of the cases of infection occur through sexual intercourse, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who don&#39;t know.
After the United States Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that disregarded Vitro Group&#39;s debt restructuring achieved via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is being set for any national company with operations in the neighboring country that is struggling to pay.
One could say, then, that the procedures for corporate survival that Mexican law allows do not apply in the land of the Stars and Stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 acknowledgment of the ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas District Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies helpless in the face of confiscation of their properties across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the floodgates for Mexico&#39;s largest glassmaker to take three inconsistencies to the US Supreme Court.
While the judge on the case points out that creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy laws, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals first says the main proceeding is the merchant bankruptcy being heard in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in bankruptcy procedures of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute used as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the debts in the bankruptcy estate that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debts would not have been obtained.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been admitted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among group companies have been certified by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Bankruptcies).
It is also true that after deducting the votes of the affiliates, Vitro&#39;s creditors, the creditors who sued Vitro in the United States courts, ie the vulture funds such as B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation, starting in 2008, in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States that hit the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal so that the vote is taken in plenary, that is, by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
Failing that, the Cerciorare Objection is filed, requesting review of the case by a higher authority, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The serious thing about this case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the commercial bankruptcy law and in which noting that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
In addition, it is noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, ie the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a hit for vitro and for the country.
General Balance
The Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Aviation Union of Pilots) has finally made progress after several months of stalled complaints by the Mexican aviation unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management.
The petition, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which it alleges is obstructing justice.
Thereafter, the regulator systematically refused to inform the Republic&#39;s Head Office of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from Bank IXE&#39;s F/589 trustee account in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to purchase shares in Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (Professional Hotel Management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
Meeting over the weekend at a University of the Caribbean forum, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of China&#39;s Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with products from across the wall, complemented by living quarters for the employees of 150 companies.
Ahead, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite governors in the Southeast to oppose the monumental facility that has been destroying partially protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, the matter is closed, according to the Mexican Institute for intellectual property already archived.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had dismissed the possibility, considering it an infringement of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex long term
Striving to pay off long-term debt without compromising short-term debt, homebuilder Homex is issuing 500 million pesos exchange certificates.
The issue is the first of four similar issues that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Founding of competition
Comprised of NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a group of companies has been formed under the name of Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life&quot;
Basketball globetrotter Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has been involved with basketball for over 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have the vast intellectual collection of the country&#39;s basketball history like Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes has been part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower class player, player in the first national division, agent and director in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Federation .
&quot;I&#39;ve worn a lot of hats in basketball all my life, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the federation in the &#39;90s,&quot; Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora&#39;s home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
&quot;Basketball was my life.&quot;
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with and testify to photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamon at heart
The most emotional memories are those that evoke his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-managing director or general manager of the club.
&quot;Those were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I&#39;ve had the privilege of being a part of eight vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as CEO, co-CEO or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
From then on &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a very good manager, took over,&quot; says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed by the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a very strong player, 2m tall.
Do you want him?&quot;
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a naturalized man and was one of our best pitchers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had provided a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance because in 1988 he was already at the top of the federation.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy&#39;s executions with the national team.
I remember the first time we beat the USA in the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze if it wasn&#39;t for that Canadian referee who made us play the last play twice, Reyes said.
Was that group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you&#39;ve ever seen?
She&#39;s among the best, as is the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team from the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and gave the USA a fight like they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
That team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also young players (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who missed out in 1990 with a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players due to what happened at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all odds.
Who Was Puerto Rico&#39;s Best Player?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I really like Leo Arill&#39;s work.
What do you think is the best thing you&#39;ve achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN up to 17 teams in one season in the early 90s.
What&#39;s left for you to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as B. the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce z. B. only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children travel and play unnecessarily.
At least I can see the result of the required training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I&#39;m proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I enjoy listening to music, watching videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and going to a basketball game once in a while.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and rose to worldwide fame with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;JR&quot;. in the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, where he played a ruthless, treacherous and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon JR Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of &#39;80s greed, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as JR in a new season of &quot;Dallas&quot; this year, died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family press release to The Associated Press through Warner Bros., producers of &quot;Dallas.&quot;
&quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, reprising the iconic role he loved the most,&quot; the family said.
Larry&#39;s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, witty, loving and talented and I will miss him dearly.
&quot;He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,&quot; Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years leading up to Dallas, Hagman rose to prominence on television as a nice guy on NBC&#39;s 1965-1970 sitcom Jeannie Charming.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive &quot;djinn&quot; (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He was also a performer in two comedies that only aired briefly, such as B.The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973).
His cinema work has included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful rendition of the enchantingly despicable JR that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS television network&#39;s dramatic series about the Ewing clan and other figures around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan &quot;Who shot JR?&quot;, intended to create anticipation for an emotionally charged episode where the character was almost killed by Hagmann, led to international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series achieved a viewer record at that time.
When the one-chapter answer broke in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, making &quot;Dallas&quot; the second most-watched entertainment program since &quot;MASH&quot; ended in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, JR&#39;s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
JR had her pregnant and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn&#39;t leave town. But others also had reasons for wanting to see him dead.
Hagman portrayed the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a conniving businessman and unfaithful husband who aspired to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed.
&quot;I know what I want JR&#39;s tombstone to say,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should read &quot;Here lies the Honorable Citizen JR Ewing&quot;.
This is the only deal he hasn&#39;t won.
Original series co-star Victoria Principal Friday remembered Hagman as a &quot;huge personality both on and off screen.&quot;
Unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of devotees around the world, he will remain in our hearts for those lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
Recording of five chapters for the second season had been completed, and a sixth chapter was in the process of being filmed, the broadcaster said.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or from TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be handled on the show.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who performed such classic works as &#39;South Pacific&#39; and &#39;Peter Pan.&#39;
Martin was still a teenager when she had Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater stage in the early 1950&#39;s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the city of Malibu, California, where many celebrities are based.
In 2001 he titled his memoir Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
&quot;I didn&#39;t write anything that I felt could harm anyone or affect them in any way,&quot; he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
&quot;I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them before and after their surgeries,&quot; he said in 1996.
I want to give them some consolation, such as B. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s a little uncomfortable the first time, but you&#39;ll be fine&quot;.
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the &quot;end of the world&quot;.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as: B. nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when the religion professor decided to teach a class about the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar&#39;s &quot;long backward count&quot; on December 21, which many people believed that it means the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the devastating hurricane Sandy, which some have dubbed &quot;Deudarmaggedon,&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,&quot; Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what&#39;s been happening in the world today as if we were thirty days away, that would be a really good period.
And he reminds that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he&#39;s not the only professor offering courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, which should be the last in history.
In Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course &quot;Media, Culture and the End of the World.&quot;
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as: B. nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
&quot;We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; he said, as well as how hypothetical scenarios that lead to certain human behavior are offered.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed apocalyptic films and how they compared to real life.
&quot;I tried to educate students about what&#39;s possible, probable, believable, and impossible,&quot; Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to offer a course simply called &quot;The End of the World.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re not recording in 2012 so we always have the option to redo the course in case the world doesn&#39;t end,&quot; said Restall.
Despite the &quot;imminent doom&quot; the students have to study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, so students have no choice but to &quot;keep working until the night when the world is supposed to end,&quot; Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
&quot;In two hours there were no more seats,&quot; Restall said of his high-average class, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
&quot;It&#39;s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Rutgers-Camden major in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic cult or religion mentality is really just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
25-year-old psychology and nursing student Will Wekesa says he has seen all of the apocalyptic films.
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a class where this is taught,&quot; he stated.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone one professor - said they believed in the final date of December 21st.
&quot;Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredit it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a senior at Temple, 21, from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has increased this speculation.
&quot;People don&#39;t think that way elsewhere,&quot; he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a La Salle University religion professor who will be teaching in the Philippines this year, is quick to respond when asked if he knows of a course on the &quot;end of the world&quot; there.
&quot;The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, indicating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that there have been many days of judgment spoken over the years, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;people will immediately think of a new date&quot; or philosophize about December 21 being the beginning a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they would like to go to celebrations about &quot;the end of the world&quot;.
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll call some friends so we can laugh together,&quot; said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
