Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and on Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution under discussion.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement structure and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-advertised deal for Iran's nuclear programme has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech to the US Congress, which was partly considered an affront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had rejected it with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot and that the officers had to come to his home.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" but was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: "I'm sorry, I wanted to do it, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." According to the authorities, this was in the letter and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police encircled him.
A day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and lecturers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said that they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentis died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had any health problem.
That year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policies meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him for an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's performance."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing from campus, the police later found Lamb's track as he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner, said Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her guitar play for a few years.
He was the swarm of women at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and residing in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which borders on a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he had heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer market three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he had Lamb and Prentis Night on night 5. September for the last time saw Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
"Just just a lucky couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joking.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the freshmen seminar program and specialized in Native Americans and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and members of the community, participated in a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and sang "Amazing Grace".
Classes will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back to life," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb called Prentis' emergency call as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees hire as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it planned to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. At the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were employed.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated yawn and an arms length from being with the princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really true to me," said Spielberg, "the biggest time travel film ever made."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - on the margins of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the splits in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran when the crisis in Syria is overcome.
8 poll ratings show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper ranks in polls, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the chances of the real estate mogul nomination.
Of course, it is too early in the electoral period.
Nobody claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he was struggling in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now seeing Trump’s stamina and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey figures that indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll from Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they are "annoyed" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent say the same thing about Trump).
Next to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "annoyed" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters trending towards the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, said ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is valid in the first primary state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarship hats, Republican voters consider Trump to be real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten survey after a four-week CNN/ORC poll saying that Trump is the best bet.
This has been a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a large number of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign to be plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely spread over more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead, ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points, ahead of Walker 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have spent their votes on their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never change the mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon, neurosurgeon, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapous" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been the linchpin in public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep crucial Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation effort.
But after Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do so.
The frustration over the government is climbing new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for around half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry with Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa republicans are frustrated with Congressional Republicans, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "indulgently annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea mud.
In the street, one square metre of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"The range of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - that is why the high price.
A new study shows the special locations in which one square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student store in Munich are not really much.
In contrast to Germany's top residences, the price seems like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square metre in dizzying heights.
There are sometimes tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, mind you.
But well, who can afford it ...
By the way: Munich is not in the lead.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time scorer in Piraeus: Bavarian star Thomas Müller has a race.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to an deserved 3-0 at Olympiacos Piraeus - then it was going.
A superior start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have brought FC Bayern to the "Mission Milan" dream in the cauldron of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiacos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and earned goal (90) with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth starting performance in series is to be the first step towards the finale on 28. May 2016 be in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
Müller received at his 28th. Matches in the Champions League for Bayern leadership granted Olympic cohort veteran Roberto, who had a shot of the world champion saw as a flank.
"We won't underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich guys kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the premier class, including renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) stumbled here.
But the Bavarians, who are undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously, but often worked too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting to the left-winger of Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against the former Brunswick Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more lucky from the right than his flank hit the right half-field in the upper left dump.
In the 67th. Minute awarded the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half had Robert Lewandowski.
Initially, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat the header of Poland off the line (26).
Then by direct decrease, the goalkeeper Roberto with his knee parried (35.).
Although the Bavarias set up their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set pinpricks.
But on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was abandoned.
For example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the bar (56th).
Before Neuer Guardiola had a chain of four with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng defend, which did it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat outside at first.
The World Championship hero had only given the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "If you want to make something different out of it, that is already malignant."
Guardiola also decided against him on the first change when he moved Kingsley Coman for the ailing Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, with Müller addressing it with a penalty.
Before the match, riots were held in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly masked Bayern fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and took action with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes does not only harm the lungs, but also their teeth - a long-term study in Potsdam suggests this.
The good news: If there is no absence, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of the long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely, in order to 2.5- to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, stresses the DIfE.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore amounts to more frequent gum inflammation in the gums in the smoker.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
However, people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the British University of Birmingham.
People must be persuaded to become a non-smoker, explained study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from late antiquity on the banks of Cologne Rhine
Once again, archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all building projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always called in as a specialist department for the preservation of Archaeological Natural Monuments.
In the third construction phase of the Rhine Boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that at the site in the 4th edition. century a fortress and in the 8. Trier explained the century a church.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman had had an accident at the train station in 'Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the population to help.
Early on Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was covered by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, it has caused severe injuries to it by recording the train.
She was treated with emergency medical attorney and taken to a hospital by emergency services.
The investigating officials have no findings on the reason for the young woman's nightly crossing tracks.
The incident was possibly observed by witnesses or local residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passersby of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Notes that shed light on the cause of the accident can be given under the free hotline of the Federal Police on telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station, which is switched around the clock and switched to the cause of the accident.
Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system to mitigate the dispute over the planned transatlantic trade agreement TTIP.
The controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in operation.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust", said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede proposes to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings provide for concrete terms that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are to come equally from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is also planned for the first time.
It would allow an appeal against judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings agreed with each other on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of objection against their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it became clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
According to her own statements, it wants to work towards an international investment court in the long term.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could then be clarified there.
The investor-state arbitration proceedings (ISDS), which are primarily required by large corporations, are considered one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, through which companies can dispute damages at the expense of taxpayers, undermine national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In its initial statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate.
It was particularly criticised that they should not be subject to the free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta) that has already been negotiated.
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission takes into account key issues drawn up by Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration tribunals is off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of the economy to bear through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded was continued unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been underway since mid-2013.
However, the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA.
It was originally intended to provide a framework for the agreement at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer tenable.
Delikat Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him stands a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the painterly US state of Michigan with a felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Steven's lecture.
He talks about various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, about which his meticulous and tenderly arranged songs tell.
Where they were created and what it looks like there in his home country.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs are released, which corrave harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a bold series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a consequence.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
Stevens occurs here.
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
One year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") is a celebrated masterpiece in 2005.
Exclusive of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes use of very extensive electronic set pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and reverb.
Having long since emerged from the smaller clubs, the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you can hear that the lecture is more "opulent" and you can throw away the "record basically".
Only for an encore does Stevens than gratitude modestly, play acoustically few older songs and finally bows to thrash applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and come together with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance being probably examined by the media and the Labour MPs up close.
He called for "less theatres and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it will come after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour leader's decision, on Tuesday, during the singing of the national anthem, has a commemoration of 75th anniversary. To remain in silence anniversary of the Battle of Britain, criticism provoked by a number of Tory MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood respectfully silence" and that he had recognized the "Heroe of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, referring to differences in the economy, defense, and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "pile up" within Labour, namely, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limit on gains.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour proposed changes to remove the whole idea of a limiting overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labour and retirement minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26,000 to 23,000 dollars.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, who has been David Cameron who has been Tory leader over the past decade over the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "shifting" and fighting with barbs, and instead has set out to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad.
He also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak, and that he had raised the floor to John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time was regarded as the Prime Minister's main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it had become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.
'Tueste in Joburg': Homeless young people trained to become photographers

But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth in how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound Rises by Accelerated Wage Growth in the UK
The pound rose abruptly by data that show an increase in the UK wage growth. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest and made estimates of the date of an interest rate hike since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to a price of 1.5505 and rose to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20% after the acquisition offer of rival AB InBev.
One transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for Richemont luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales are beating all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are reporting growth again.
Stocks of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining giant said that he had estimated 2.5 billion. through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment of the company's rating to "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are at risk of expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company, he says.
The costs could be hit JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
A lush 21 years young, a Hänfling with an obscort frise.
The type with platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Rather even more.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
These include Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish woman has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: Here lives her idol, whose poster hangs in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite of the Canadian singer lives costs as much as her mother Ewa earns in the six months of the day.
If anything.
She says: "Actually, my Wiktoria should be in the tenth grade in the secondary school."
"I am fulfilling her a dream."
Compulsory schooling?
Wen juckt's?
The fans don't.
Even Bieber itself does not.
He has done anyway.
For the advertising during the commercial break of the Superbowl, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pitch company washed many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And Bieber also cashes at every doll that looks like him and over the counter.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is just in the USA and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" at number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, do not interest the many zeros at first.
At least he does that way.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to potato darkener idea
Potatoes or Dön?
Both are the case - namely in the potato rooster, which the Oldenburg snack bar holder Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of a kebab" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potato and meat put together on a skewer.
The idea was brought by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "pot potatoes instead of a kebab", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, a grill skewer that is stocked with meat and potatoes turns in its shop.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered the idea at the patent office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the spit does not contain.
Only this much: "It tastes even better together," he thinks.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-to-stand campaign to combat Aldi incur
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi parade in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earth campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million Ã... Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and are building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice cream manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash will provide more details of its defense strategy on the 29th. September published when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA store transactions and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after the opening of his first markets, Aldi will snatch away around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all available players, but mainly self-employed retailers, sales.
According to a report released this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose 360 million dollars per year of sales and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year, Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, generating revenues of 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and in quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash approximately 13 million dollars before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's sales in the food and grocery business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told Metcash at a Melbourne business lunchtime that Metcash was likely to be told within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which supplies around 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting down and investing more than 150 million dollars to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label food.
Metcash's Managing Director Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and shop reorganizations will lend to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis association, Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", found the spotlight with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters as a result of the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison exclaiming: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen racking up a racket after a seizure of a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite emature about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi has been drawn a little into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a racket when he lost to the US Open because of a spasm, but he is not the first player to break a frustration racket with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I believe he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he trains he is well in shape, he is in a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra as a long-term integral part of the team."
"At first, we want the team to be entirely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick made the ascent very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight, where he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closing the border, holding refugees back
Hungary declares emergency and sealed off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come to the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck and built tents in a strip of land in an unknown time in a strip of land between the two checkpoints of the countries and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbian Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border could not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refuge in the running-up Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that, after all, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU member states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not hope for an imminent action of Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions, which was declared on Tuesday, gave authorities more powers to overcome the crisis, so that they could unlock roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and the entry point for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the arriving are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, make a crime the crossing of the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia. These laws also set higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the deployment of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are about to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car with barbed wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important crossing of borders near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves into there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection from Serbia and Hungary, saying that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead halved in national poll over Bernie Sanders
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground over her.
Clinton now has 47 percent of Democratic voters' support for primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether to run for president, receives support for 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primary.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is clear which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more stagnant in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while Sanders made some profits.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these leadings have decreased.
Their support for men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only lagging behind with 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on the same edge.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic primaries' electorate nationwide say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
They would not support six percent.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic prime voters say they are enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, less Republican voters say this about their leading candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked on an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time becoming a woman becoming president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also quoted.
Since the vice-president throws potential for the presidency into the balance, 57 percent of the Democratic voters of the primary voters want to see him in the race - although a third believe that he should not do it.
If Democratic voters of the primary are asked who would be their second election for the party, Biden is at the head.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second election far from Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders, competing with Biden in the race without him, increases.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers it the "most eligible" has risen.
Nevertheless, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about their eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out unacceptable for these voters of the primary.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are making good results in some important characteristics among voters of their party's primaries.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best with the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primaries generally also look ideologically at Clinton, Sanders and Biden, in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during the term as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their clarification of the matter and say that it has not affected their overall opinions.
But it is another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their declaration, while only about one third is satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy did not affect Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated.
It is mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their Clinton views have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points fewer since May.
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters see Trump as honest and untrustworthy nationwide.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good marks on the lead.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best in honesty.
A majority of Sanders looks more honestly, but like Carson, many do not have an opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves up in national polls near Donald Trump
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest survey by CBS News/New York Times
The two candidates now account for half of voters' support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically stop
Republican voters continue to support large numbers of Trump nationwide. Support is growing by 23% in the last CBS poll before Fox News debate last month, around 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican electorate with higher education.
The rest of the pew, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen lowly, from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus % and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, which was published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in the polls - it ends up with 19% support for Republicans, behind which Trump with 32% support.
The latest poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson that rose last week, Trump found some sweat for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's belief.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beach holidaymakers to find warm water.
A swim in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: the water in the North Sea and Baltic Seas this week has a maximum of 18 degrees, the German Weather Service (DWD) says.
In contrast, bathing temperatures still offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even peaks up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the peak, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood encumbered with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a harassing ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, assassination charges against five people are filed.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta-Psi brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to approach a goal via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng passed out and was allegedly waiting for an hour before they took him to a hospital, saying the police.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and fundamentally put the welfare of the Brotherhood over Michael Deng's police chief," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added to injuries to the head, trunk and thighs with blunt force.
"Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died of harassment every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be brought to justice, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal association.
"We want to blame not only the people involved, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold it to justice," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the bull market will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history offers only a small guide to the process for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
As a result, US Federal Reserve representatives have stressed so vehemently that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather to the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated due to an interest rate hike.
"The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interests to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to a seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
Here is a view based on historical trends how some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market seen last month, anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a tendency for asset yield to be stifled 12 to 24 months after the initial increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s rate hikes.
More precisely, the market has been mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike, quite flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing a number of conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is most noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point with a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate hikes since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and only expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have focused on a Fed rate hike all year round, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only gives a 25% chance.
"In our study, all increasing cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and has very quickly dwarfed pre-recession levels after the onset of the recovery," the report said.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the Fed's longest since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than for stocks when they change their strategic price.
In bonds, yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/lowering takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often generate better returns in such a climate, even though "we are still cautious, higher yields to be expected," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy Expectations.
"In addition to the size of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the revenue curve is flater, credit lines have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also financing their debts.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the clients.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) each.
Debts become a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree with how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station for its "stupiding"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he is doing something that private channels do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public radio station was "dumb" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word "sdumb" - but it seems to become Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only among another name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, where you actually only imitate what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn anywhere else about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and music making that is really unsurpassed.
"And I really think it is important to Radio 3's commitment to find new music and to commission new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that work harder to engage the audience than did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that came under fire to kick the commercial rival on commercial rivals during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture, media and sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million dollars.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly prominent?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC way".
He added that he wanted the company to find "a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from paying the fee for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed down spending in November
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and decline until 2000, then it has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG Sales Index of the Guardian.
He explained that online sales stepped up three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. home on the sofa.
But now this is looming, and we may see growth decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in revenues.
Experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5's spending a little more than 1 dollars was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the city centres.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca at the crown - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried away by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group as a burden
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mecca's Great Mosque.
Prolonged filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by the Holy Site, where only days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayer.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction at the Bin Laden family construction company because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 prayers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Hajj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was prohibited from travelling abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj, which later this month were taking place.
The Bin Laden group has not expressed any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for a statement.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's large mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is managed by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on major construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amidst strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million riyals (€174,000) should be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same sum permanently injured.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen being opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammers and brushes in favour of the deployment of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can skimp your walls with a hammer or a brush, you nowadays apparently belong to a minority.
After all, the company headed behind B&Q is increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close to 60 B&Q sales outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment the men predominate among the staff.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households who are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the head of a UK leader in the FTSE100 Index, has also redirected her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has staffed exactly 50% of the team with women, including its management and financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher announced a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice master Aich/Dob had to become jointly responsible for the regional court of Klagenfurt because of infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was finally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Public Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation had emerged that the defendants used funds from club accounts for private purposes between 2006 and 2011 over which they were allowed to plan in their functions.
He puts the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
This fact was eliminated by the chairmen of the jury, Judge Michaela Sanin.
Negotiations will be held at a later stage.
To throw the infidelity, the defence stated that the association had never created a disadvantage of assets.
The sports officials had only offset compensation caused expenses and brought the sports club, for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 Schillings in 2001 (around the company. 44.000 Euros).
"Back then, we were faced with the situation: do we keep the club or we closed?" said one of the defendants, large company auditors of the tax office in the bread profession.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all risks.
"We advanced money, put our life insurance policies on the bank as collateral," he said at the interrogation.
The association has agreed: you can freely manage the money, only no debts may be paid.
Furthermore, with the appropriate financial success, the payment of the expenses was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the expense compensations were only paid out years later, namely from the year 2003, when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed in-deaches seemed, the former chairman explained the activities.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association was not interested in detail in the financial storage, only the debt-free was important, according to the answer.
When an investigation into the official investigation into the official began in 2011 for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
These were reserves, the defendants said.
This securities account ran into the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to it.
"Why?" asked the judge.
The respondent did not know an answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought he thought that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "property recycling".
Why compensation for damage?, wanted to know the judge and prosecutor.
Then the first defendant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only miscalculated than each other.
He had charged the club 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to show exact documents for the early years.
They were no longer kept after a tax audit in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received kilometre money.
All remedies were made in cash, for which he had to go from his residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will be held on 23 February 2004. September continued with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff reduction that has been running for three years, the computer giant will be mining further jobs in the division of the company.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are uncovered.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to reduce the amount of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This is expected to costs of 2.7 billion. USD (2.4 billion Euro) the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will become a special burden of around 2.7 billion. Leading the dollars that will be incurred from the fourth quarter onwards.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, is not yet complete.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
The Hewlett-Packard share fell by 2.3 percent.
The large-scale group from Palo Alto, California, is currently dividing up: the computer and printing business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the course will be listed on the stock exchange.
Another disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers after its services were supplemented by the world's second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.4 billion. Dollar.
This resulted in revenues in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a splitting and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more stores online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total reduction of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent were in agreement.
61 percent like the fact that other states are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria are positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
51 percent of respondents reject cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.

Röszke: Outbreak of violence on Serb-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees at Röszke at the Serbian border.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the police officers a water cannon was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles according to the officials.
The officers initially used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees slumped together and suffered from short breath.
The press secretary of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether interest rates are raised or not for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half who were said to be last week believed that the Fed would do so now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the present level of 0 -0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Fed put interest on zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Officer at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to prepare for an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances of this step are good.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Death gunner at Delta State University left letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleague later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it wanted to "kill" him at the first murder and "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning
and said that he had shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call staff member that the police need to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife yesterday night," and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but which "no one will be disturbed," but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note by Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm sorry I wanted to undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's performance."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentis also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they had been married for about seven years, as a "good person."
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentis' daughter was "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentis, who owned a dog named Lightning, has been meeting with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them, "He is not going to jail."
When the police later caught up on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fleeing on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a PhD from Delta State University, as stated by his life at the university's website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is also allegedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this will certainly take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is implementing the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate reconstruction.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year with a better organisation alone.
The Group reconstruction will cost the job at 150 of the approximately 1000 executives worldwide.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa is implementing its corporate structure and upgrading the cheap subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment was to contribute earnings of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer become a member of the Executive Board for passenger business in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the team of CEOs Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the realignment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organisation of the 120 000 employee-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff dispute with the pilots' association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to be resumed after the court-ended strike this Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
The topic of the talks is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible "in one year with a forecast record result".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transition supply of the pilots, this is the "Wings" austerity concept.
It provides that Lufthansa is outsourcing routes to the Group's own low-cost Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-wing defender cry and will exclude it from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th century. Minute caused after 20-year-old Shaw collapsed into the PSV area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the changing room.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it will take six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not penalized the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your news. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recovery is now starting, I'm coming back more."
Related to view: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the UK defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you then hear that it is a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball heading in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it feels like, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad. I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Certainly David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents will learn soon: if your child loves a book, it will not take long before you almost know it by heart.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When he was asked by a childcare system provider to name his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister decided to sign The Lorax, the environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the site of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to pre-read to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflects a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the girl of his dreams to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling their desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the greedy, trees-cutting Once knitting Thneed, despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, purred creature "speaking in the name of the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street spokesperson said that the text was probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
Encountering Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting formation, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear any scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowder and Adil Rashid, even if it is an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
This is the following: Adam Lyth is eliminated from the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to vent Adam Lyth is of course difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there have been two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared towards results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination since - and I said this earlier - players are their own best selection.
A long time ago, Lyound the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopefully comes out further running for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test pokesman gets to set his own signal is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but this lost opportunity lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batologist I greone.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he finished 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which hit us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as the one before him, but this depends, of course, on the team set-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having mosses beaten next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks, emerged, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a bat man can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a devil guy from cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for her, and there is no big difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he performed as an opener in 2001.
He immediately ended three hundred runs and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spiral, and in my limited interaction with him he impressed me a lot as a young man.
People may look at his stats - on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there are no large number of backup spirals raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a couple of smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor to the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experiences, since he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful insert to the setup.
I have always felt that he was made for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is in harmony with what was said before.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the one-dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team displays do not determine the schedule.
And you need to remember that as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not a slight heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit from the EU) could gain in popularity if the economy falls into a slack by 2017
David Cameron's unexpected renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn became the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is severely coming to terms over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat's friend recently said that some member states, so deeply involved in various crises as the EU is and not always out of their own fault, Britain's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which they usually do not want, are fed up.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it did not like it if it endangered social protection.
We could call it Dave and Georges Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb up summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local figures, then come home and say that they are winning allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain looking outside inside the EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and makes you sight that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the excessively long endurance such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's Francois Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
It is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine pulling out a leg to help the selfie party, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately pservely planning to make helpful comments, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Great Britain has not gained any value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barone, but how they were not during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villagers, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-internal countries who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but realized that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum vortices, because Blair had put the principle above the non-adopted constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door for him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time to waste time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I squeeze it friendly - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue-dyed dye tendency and the wilder climes of Tory's small-nationalistism can probably say yes to anyone.
It is what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on TV this week, when the scout fought in him not admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be disloyal towards his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow campaigners and deputies after all the reports at their closed meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the active bottom-up image of Corbyn wants - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV, especially in the whirlpool of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows Labour's support in the referendum campaign to take for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins surely thinks that way.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of what was called the British Influence Security Forum at the start on Monday.
Experts criticize report from Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principle report" last month and described it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE established its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who have been convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors had previously received from British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting explained that funds received from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing he is said to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International according to reports before, they added.
The reasons for selecting the panel members are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also attended the meeting.
The group's research "states significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products in most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is so far no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what proves and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion. per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in hard-controversial time slots against their rivals' most popular shows and from channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to come into contact with the BBC without success for six years in his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC commissions programs that are clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Supreme Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least want to keep your production on programmes that others do not make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time frame because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programs funded that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both self-productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see what public television should be.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience pretty much, but they do their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion dollars, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
At the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I call you to find a more regressive system regarding conditions who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission be informed of "to inform, form and maintain."
He said little of the BBC production is now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example of the public television stations in Australia and Canada change this in "educate and maintain".
To the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms, which he said of which are only a handful of television to be shown, and with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Further information on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brains of people to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
Garmers usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the changed creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbears and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the changed motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads shamed Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons watch fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle shattering leg restraints!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock bars that cause excruciating pain, but do not leave a trail!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this advertisement is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to give the British government's willingness to remove weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and which require a second glance.
"Important announcement: Drive from 15th to 18th September with DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the type types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which is becoming an image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with DLR ... Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pack of Allen keys, which are claimed to "gain access to around one-third of bus stop advertising spaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this postering "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists are going to work with activists inside protest movements and notice that they have to go outside to the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trade posters greets the commuters in the metro.
The Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the promotion of the arms fair - through a void of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady company advertising, but "though in the feeling with bright colors and animation remains stronger."
"They did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are selling fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order from the US army about "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battle head, which provides outstanding after-effect effects inside the goal."
Whatever this does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgetful 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still in the belief in Beret's and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I were annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to talk: people tell people where you come from, whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to figure out the people you like, as opposed to those you would not speak to, even if your eyelashes were fired and these fire extinguishers were.
Let people.
People's rooms often transform into drink receptions, film night venues and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people attract and their underwear moves.
Related to this: Don't remember to start at university with a relationship
Introverts receive gross treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dormitories form a space-to-room-bug culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to leave for me to get back the energy I have consumed for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a fellowship of social equality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Do it.
A guy in my student dorions had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you start the university at the height of the baking mania, knocking on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate of brownies is less strange than welcoming the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and will end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to sit down asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, the clution of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
Chances are that they say they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate who added a washing-up agent to her milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or from work.
It is not just a question of being a decent person, but that you are literally among the people sitting in the glasshouse in the true sense of the saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if it makes them something to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They reacted with even more music.
When she finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she kindly let her neighbours sleep for two hours before she let her own music blith on her door, finished her door and turned herself to her three-hour test.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student dormitory?
Conversely, it wouldn't be deeply embarrassed if you hold a roommate for your future spouse, get ready for her, separate again and then have to see it every day and perhaps experience how she moves all the mutual friends over towards?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to persuade your abdomen to a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their non-closed room, the boundary between an Ulk and Bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never mess up anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Clos their door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but stay their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the MittelfFranka valley for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need apartment space, but also the single mother and the low-player."
"I show how you can still build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how cheap housing can be created quickly: he builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we will need enough housing in the next decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you store people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, excluding land.
This is manageable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have done my project correctly under construction law.
It always makes the impending small amount of special construction and the parking space regulations particularly complicated.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is there a lack of space.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
That is definitely not true.
But do you not tighten up the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True is: We have had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even the ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income earner.
I show how to build cheaply and well today.
That is what it is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems engineering in Regensburg and initially worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, taping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message saying that the "Software update has failed".
To work around the problem, users are suggested to either wait for the onslaught to return or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made it less likely by slimming down the update. It will also be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could lead to a termination of the update.

You should also make sure that you have reviewed our checklist of all things before your download to prevent things from going wrong and protecting themselves if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg only knows one motto in the battle for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Championship runner emphasised before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the runner-up before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title champion and two-champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the twelve races of the season so far and also tackles the floodlight Grand Prix in the city-state as the favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an influence on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a haze hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has included another member in its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kissingen more than 40 times for a course of time.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Merit 1. Class and honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation accommodating chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to record chess players who are unable to apply the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Accommodation office searches for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift center have joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation is drawn down from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely to the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, directly next to the purchasing market, senior citizens and those seeking advice now receive information on questions such as nursing care insurance or on benefits for health and care insurance companies.
For years, we have been saying that often cared relatives are left alone with our outpatient care service.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Many benefits from the checkouts are not often used, because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood," explained the new host Jutta Weigand, who as head of the old people's care division is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken on board for this purpose.
Therefore, additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the senior centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," explained Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is particularly due to demographic change.
This will make a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration ceremony, the district office also dedicates himself to the club's parenting in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular socialising".
In this way, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution that senior citizens can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4pm to 6pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg against Würzburg Kickers on the 6th October
Now it is official: after the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third league club Würzburg Kickers had not yet been determined because of renovation work at the Fuchspark stadium, the 6th cent. October as a date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the round of 16: Bavarian Football Totopoal against the third division club FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally scheduled.
The game will be played on Tuesday, the 6th October, at 19. Clock in the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is going on, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the ticket sales that has now been started.
It is special for our team to play against a third division club.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlights have a special appeal.
FC Eintracht Bamberg moved into the round of the last 16 teams in 2010 through victories in the district stalk team 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league club 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5,000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on the 5th of May. September at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century. Century in Vienna," as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking: Tim Wiese throws police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese noticed badly in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and is engaged in Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants 30 kilograms of muscle mass to gain in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not acquire.
When he saw a parking spacekeeper outside, he was cutting his hair in downtown Bremen when he saw a box paper outside for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Then meadow stormed out of the shop, insulted the officer and threw the fine due at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The accusations are confirmed in the city of Bremen, but are not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The thing is still in the exam," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that it is decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the climate typical of the Isla del Rey of the Isla del Rey are ideally suited for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For three days now, the Panamanian authorities have been taking out the 4500 plants and burning them.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11.45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one from the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called on them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft filling station.
Three people were also on the grounds of the petrol station.
One of these men now shouted at the youngsters and slapped it with his fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nose and bleeded strongly from the nose.
When his two friends rushed together and persuaded the racket, he initially vented his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their home and drove by demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was not seen anymore, the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, they beat the face and the victim's thighs.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 metres tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to report to 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeinde mayor Bernd Bormann, business development promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinasse Kabbert are also looking forward to this.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller on the 1. October the practice Felstehausen.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will still beat his successor in the next few months with half the next few months.
After a conversion phase, Müller will open its practice on 12 October. October again, until then he invested 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens were Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden Hospital and also wants to go into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When the time had come, I just called them."
The Müller couple liked the idea of doing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees his own boss as an advantage.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up there, his medical studies in Hanover followed after stints in several doctor's offices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed leading emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and volunteered in the DRK readiness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From the 19th The practice for the new boss is being prepared in September.
During the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialised in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"Endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a consultation room more.
In addition, the computer is completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a total subsidy of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district (25,000 euros) as well as from the joint municipality (12,500 euros) and the municipality (12,500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will be continued," emphasises the mayor of Samtgemeinde Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, around 2,000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, while in the average practice in northern Germany there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had found itself, it would have gone.
By the way, anyone who attends Müller's consultation hours continues to look above all in familiar faces: takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaner from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
A little nostalgia she already feels after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing: "We have a 6000 square meter plot."
"Until now, I have always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
The couple also have two grandchildren and loves to travel.
Croatia: 'We let the refugees through'
"Now the border controls are also being ramped at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The care and security of people is in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "clear signals are needed," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept boundless migration flows, not even via the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow arriving refugees to travel forward to Austria and Germany and possibly also build corridors for the refugees.
However, this did not see this Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable" and Slovenia will instead intensify the monitoring of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, however, Slovenian does not want to shut down its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfill their obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to pass the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia on the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly making their way in Tovarnik, Croatia.
It is mainly Syrian and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already in use.
In the coming days, his country will remain around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted to Croatia, the Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was worth saying people to take certain routes: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this," it was said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early morning, and further buses are expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away.
"We heard that Hungary were closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to a route a little further west for the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Maces-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers.
Croatia: 'Comprehensive border control opportunities'
Croatia's Minister of the Interior, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that as a non-Schengen member, Croatia had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Take strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 and the EU partners have been issuing a good testament to the country since then on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to the Belgrade media reports, they spent the past night at the Horgos crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgo and Backi Breg will remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure Wednesday at a local view in Horgos: he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees, now that the Hungarian border is closed, premature.
At present, it would not be very high refugee figures.
It could not be said yet whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes are marked through Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not without danger: even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still non-cleared minefields in parts of the border area.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals, who is accused of having gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The captured information is said to have made insider business on the financial markets.
According to investigators, a total of more than 100 million dollars were suffered.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately trapped," says the SEC no-action.
The trials against 32 other defendants in that case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the USA and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a large number of operations around Mannheim Paradeplatz.
The people do their errands, sometimes quick steps, sometimes leisurely stroll.
You shall head for the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at Paradeplatz.
Light railways.
Pulsating, full life with a wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large tables each with the headline "I want to die before I want to die"....
The ecumenical hospice aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is certainly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical hospice aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as volunteers.
While some passers spontaneously takes up the chalk and add the sentence to "answer my life in the affirmative", "can read", "go through the USA with the camper", "stop the war" or "do not suffer long", others remain brief, read, say sentences such as "I am not yet so far" and then go on.
Time and again, small discussions develop on the sidelines about the action itself, about life, the handling of dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I make it clear that the end will come to this world at some point will I be able to live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which, together with the Caritas Association, is the bearer of the ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this high-profile action is good for the 20-year-old.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still afflicted with taboos, if Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement has contributed greatly in recent years to people open up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience, she confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the euthanasia.
When the ecumenical hospice aid sought volunteers by calling, it registered immediately and had been there when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - which accompanies those affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice St. Vincent.
All they are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences done.
"I see life from another perspective, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient ecological hospice service is free of charge and non-confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years, training courses are offered for new employees.
The panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, other personal requests can be noted on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects for 2016 reduced
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its gain to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it would earn a profit of between 10,40 and 10.90 dollars in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous prediction.
Analysts expected a survey by FactSet 10.84 .
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and on the 4th century. January will become effective and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said it nevertheless expects to increase earnings compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenues and growth in online retail.
Fred Smith, Chairman and CEO said that the company is "making strong returns considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which was released on 31. August ended, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 per share, just behind the €24.4 per share, which twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted.
Revenues increased by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected 12.23 billion dollars.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority posting in recent years, which brought revenues in its unit for stagnation in its unit for posting.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues in ground transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell by 3.85 dollars, or 2.5 percent, to 150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11th. June.
At their most anticipated meeting in the years, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed leader Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests before all other things.
The central bank has a twofold order from Congress: maximising US employment and prices keep stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start from being weaned by the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy's data shows that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by raising the increase in federal bond interest rates, even if only a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the job market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing they are watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettleing the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets are expecting the Fed waiting, with a key indicator that indicates only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average rose 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the set this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised the sentences at this point," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her explanation to reassure the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will be trading.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be required, they expected an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level that the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the year-end target of central bank 2%, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shrugged together at the end of last month after China downgraded its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was down by more than 16% high in May, when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now being nearly 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would put on the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s main concerns, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making process.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, the Fed representatives can be expected not only to oversee developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Asset Management Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions to financial market movements that are not seemingly linked to economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its policy rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite more discernible impact on US growth," said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008, Adam S said. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England Interest Management Committee.
The recent turbulence does not come near this plain, he said.
"It certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets are upset," said Poznan, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should come ahead of time.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.

Parking: LAX-C has its own park area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small help for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome does not work without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who support asylum seekers in the city inherently.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
She also loves to teach with its 74 Lenzen.
Every Thursday it does it in the asylum seeker's home on Dillinger Straße.
There it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different lessons than at a real school.
Brazil's paediatric Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS tries to elucidate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers will be advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried sports hall
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flater for solar system.
The plans for long-awaited gymnasium construction on the Bernried sports grounds are moving forward step by step: In the youngest municipal council meeting, the elaborated building application was unanimously approved without major discussions.
Previously, the committee had decided, among other things, an application for a construction "exception" or "liberation" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with a non-center ridge and roof" is to be built.
The background to the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This gives us a wonderfully large south roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again concerned with the aquex, which, for energy reasons - contrary to the development plan - should be below ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An "liberation" became necessary because the development plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the aquener pitch - whereby the Bernried municipal council usually proceeds rather restrictively in the case of applications for exemption.
However, gymnasium construction is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
The gymnasium construction at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated in costs.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports promotion.
In the next step of the proceedings, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the district office for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) new medical director at the Schongau hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which confirmed land advising Councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board makes a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, 23. September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Peißenberg.
The vast majority should move with Fischer and the existing Inner Station to Schongau.
The rooms are present.
According to Jochner-Weiß, employees who cannot be visited Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees are informed about the plans.
The change triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play on the question of who should succeed himself who is ready to take part in from 1. Taking over the management of October and moving to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "enhancement" and a broadening of the offer in the "inner medicine" area," says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specialises in gastroenterological diseases in the Inner Ward.
In the next two years, Fischer will be moving transition for the next two years, if the supervisory board agrees, will lead both houses until the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years next year.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrietin Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the supervisory board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal shortage, will be used as accommodation for asylum weavers in the future.
"I'll exclude that." As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
Currently, Caritas short-term care and a daytime psychiatry are housed there.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," says Fischer about the quasi-relocation to the Lech, who had been received by the employees "positive and very understanding".
There has been no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The hospital Peißenberg (only 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (8.15 pm) at the Bergisch HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite, but there is no reason to move away.
Last season, the bathers were defeated by the BHC and made up for something there.
Hunting accident involving two injuries at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by shots during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the Abernten on a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg district), several hunters were deployed, as the police told.
After a shot, a 63 and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
Initially, it was not clear how exactly the accident could happen.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victim of violent crimes
An official has led the police to the body of 16 year olds from Rhineland-Palatinate, which have been missing since Saturday.
In interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to kill the youth and thrown their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing from Rhineland-Palatinate, has fallen victim to a crime of violence.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.

Refugees need shelters: study warns of housing gap
The location on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution fights on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arriving refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overburdened in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study on behalf of the association alliance "Social Housing".
By way of comparison, this year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in an initial reception shelter as asylum seekers.
Many then come to the housing market and join the long lines in front of the rented apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also represents considerable omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit ahead of it, which is growing from year to year.
Matthias Günther, author of the study, complains about 770,000 residential units in the conurbations.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in flat-sharing rooms.
Young adults stayed longer at the "Hotel Mama" due to the doldrum on the housing market.
In the large cities, the number of square metres per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives are to stimulate social housing.
For example, property transfer tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidised housing could be suspended for a temporary basis.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation from Staatsbank KfW is already well received by towns and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the available available had already been called up on Monday evening at 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free escort: Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
There is practically no longer getting through Hungary, and more and more refugees choose their way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will pass through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke with the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if it is necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister of the Interior, Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set off to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there.
500 people have come across the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed off its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, are also practically superfluous for ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can go through and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid both by bus and taxes.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
The border strip has other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Minespacers are now to quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closing of the border, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police had 366 people picked up.
Shortly before gate close on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damage to the border fence as a criminal offence.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town of Szeged in the southern Hungarian border town of
The convicted person faces prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the newly established "transit zones" on Tuesday, including almost all - 93 - most of the Röszke transition.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were 40 more refugees.
However, practically no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the "transit zone" in Röszke.
Workers started cleaning up in Röszke.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left behind on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barrier grilles were dismantled and one of the reception centers in the border town was rebuilt.
To the goal of this reconstruction, nobody wanted to express themselves.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria reached only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting to continue their journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by order of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"After the Bridge Festival on Sunday, we were busy cleaning up when ten people suddenly stood with suitcases at the entrance to the tent," says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was at the end of Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chached the stranded people together with two other helpers and their cars across the border into Nahe Passau.
Before that, we ate the unexpected guests first, with snack and drinks.
We immediately said that we are taking them to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not miss to miss a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased with that," says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE train to Passau on Sunday evening on Sunday evening, in order to try cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail services to Germany had been stopped, but still tried over the border.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border crossing is generally very popular.
The bridge festival combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, a two-bridge race sporting day before - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures in the Röszke camp to ensure humanity, our Chancellor has, very officially and publicly moved the stance of the Hungarian government into the haze of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
Refugees will also have to realize that the "promised land" that it has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-proof districts
Konrad has their hands full with the accommodation of refugees.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has set up the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception centre for Traiskirchen has already been under control by Konrad.
"We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday also took place without a big frying, said Konrad and praised the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 districts this year.
In order to meet the number, there must be found another 35,000 accommodations in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the states, and 15,000 the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it is not a bottomless barrel," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the provincial governors.
They would have assured him that they would also be created for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria, things are going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP manager supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF campaign "Helping Like Us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, people are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticised the standards for housing as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that quarter providers have to keep a certain height of the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
For a temporary period, "not-standards" would have to apply.
Konrad explains with his experience that he is more successful in accommodating in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior.
I am an elderly Lord, to whom untruth is not readily told in the face.
Persuasiveness is his main weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The own accommodation search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are apparently problems with permission.
Linz calls for a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open up urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center for the Accommodation of Refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, since they can currently accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations are to be examined for their suitability in the event of an emergency.
The city chief criticises the division of refugees within the state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Boundings are not sealed off"
In a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) signed the next approach to the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Once again, Pühringer called on the other EU member states to increase solidarity in the refugee question.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls again at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the actions of the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industriezeile is officially completed.
The listed IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, while the remainder (2700 square metres) is to be leased to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquire them.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the techcenter, which is owned by one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square metres of remaining space in the building are already leased, there are requests for a further 40 percent.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second shop in the arcade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to buy a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade without a guidance regarding: after all, she has now been grown in the form of another business restaurant.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and dress from various manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags from the Furla brand, and purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday the new shop is in operation.
Several weeks had been rebuilt before.
"But I thought for a long time whether I should open another shop," says Breit.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also fond of the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots themselves.
Her fashion interest has gotten broad of her mother in the cradle.
It is most good for me when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some woman gets into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag, the specialist cannot answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag values every outfit.
The Brulljes maker from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called shown.
This characteristic also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excited people.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, if journalists rages or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidency is shocking the election campaign.
And cut off well.
This is also registered in the Kallstadt of the Palatinate, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairdryer is known to many in the winegrowing village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200-inhabited place are over - tens of corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in an election campaign mode.
The Kallstadtrin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they think they think they think they are somehow exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary film about the place and his famous offspring, which includes Trump but also the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so saying that he would certainly also be successful if he were living in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts there.
While there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to be the opinion that Trump is "a little big mouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the show-off, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the shower.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold miners in the USA.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first property purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland failed permanently before the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate at that time belonged.
He did not accept Trump because he had once run away without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared a film release.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This stands in contrast to the sometimes pristine statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The way the rumbling, it is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a née Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The retired winegrower sees the American rather distant, "he is always so short-tempered".
Does he believe that Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pension farmer Veronika Schramm mentions like many Kallstadters that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which generally arrived well.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
It would find it better if he did not win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I do not know whether that is good".
If those who were in charge in the USA at the time of his grandfather had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winegrower Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe without President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, saw 12,000 moviegoers, and interest also awakens in the USA.
The Upper Bavarian community of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climbing village".
From the hands of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountaineering villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineer village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of Liberal leadership, but it has not caused any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed the fall of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Army Days, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise scored an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, in the comparison of Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to Monday's ratings (37,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number lagged behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 were lost.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators at 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, 14. September 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former production star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening responded with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and beat slightly The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two from The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 pm to 6:30 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuiere's Hot-Seat (623,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 spectators and 720,000 in the second half hour.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the odds of The Chase Australia's second evening will be encouraged by Nine that hot seat will eventually prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to outstrip the McGuiere's show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Hidden secret? ...
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unknowingly unknowingly have who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally ends up in The Bachelor, was enveloped in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows the day before three two became, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have lynically left their way about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should Wood's last rose become?", their answers to the spoiler could become who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons Fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay as the best partner for Wood, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and (Sarahs) and remarked Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jevana's fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that last week's house visit made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly set to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not she, she was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne selected the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches had banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble as the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first Punt return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt return and also in the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne paves at a Punt Restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first playing quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
In total, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian tarmament field.
After openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated and stopped his democratic efforts.
The Free Voters are demanding the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW autumn ice centre in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are not appropriate for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will be given faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Voters' parliamentary group meets until Friday in the Lower Franconian community.
Actually, completely different main themes were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Vote Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as founded during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s.
"This is no further, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Voter Leader.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport Free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW head criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states throughout Germany."
"Bavaris shifts, others don't."
"We need to become more capable of action."
But state politics in the city of large walls should not fall under the table.
A year-long hit remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Kultusminister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "Intermediate Level plus" at 47 grammar schools, in which an extension of the secondary school is tested from three to four years - as a result it then takes nine years to graduate from high school.
But that does not go far enough to Aiwanger.
"The topic of the G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all the high schools that want to.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after policemen fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd who were demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an officer said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Senior District official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal said that the police inserted tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been governed centrally for centuries.
Working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction area in the city planned
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mixture of trade, trade and residential is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of land in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and residential.
You are waiting for appropriate offers, it is said by the city.
Which investor is suitable is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded yet.
The town of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstrasse / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and demolished the building on it.
Project Hieve: Details are lying on the table
The planning of the holiday home settlement on the Kleine Meer near Emden takes shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Several neighbours are still worried - they fear the sell-out of their leisure refuge
For months, negotiations had been negotiated, threatened, debated and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home town on the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time publicly on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP parliamentary group, who accused the investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went on the offensive from the system construction management: "We don't have an answer to all the questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among sea court owners who had come to the meeting yielded the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea store owner and board member at the Interests Section of Lieutenants, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that overlooks all other buildings."
In addition, like a number of other project critics, he fears that traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the facility: "Entire bus loads must come, so that this pays off," says Schulz
However, what exactly happens on the well-hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"We must first have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Twins offspring at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
Frankfurt Zoo is happy to receive offspring at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The family of newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, since Mother Dian has kept her close to her body.
First the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent opportunity for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide rotogravure system on Tuesday about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance of evolving into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, approximately in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees overwhelming the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the call for funds on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing help for refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally raised donations are doubled to up to 5.5 million on google.com/refugee relief to 11 million dollars.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for lightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for lightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether lightly overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are mistreatly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and stomach tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were lightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained roughly the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who undergo surgery, the diabetes condition completely dissolved in 36% and in part in 28%.
In the medically treated group, diabetes fully dissolved in only one percent and in some cases with only about two percent.
In addition, the results of the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group" were found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as it is reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas ectotomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved major decreases in the BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1% and rather recorded a complete overhaul of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16. %).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obese people who underwent obese operation about 29 percent less likely over 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for individuals with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 with his BMI.
"I think we're waiting too long before we get people to take it seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly associated their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
Love story set in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly attracting attention in fiction: a young woman, unsaccepted and unsightly during school days, meets the swarm of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recent novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel is probably particularly interesting for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is delighted that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama raised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but not appropriate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Being cared for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create a real peace and genuine development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of the 11th anniversary. September, pointing out that the violent reaction of the US caused a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the 11th September I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to resolve this problem is in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times increase in child-care hand sanitizers in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow strongly alcoholic hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, increased the cases of revenues from hand disinfectants in children under 12 years of age, which report poison control centers, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them ends up going to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teenagers are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange scents, which are very attractive for children.
Hand disinfectants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, even a few spy can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you would not let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children come to it, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splashes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizers at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lapeled her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her signs of brain trauma overnight in a separate children's hospital, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection wipes and to store hand sanitizers out of the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died women after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, unclaimed ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was recorded as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York State planned to poison their "general" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom," a police report reports.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the foiled plan as a "chatter" and referred to the school authorities disciplinary measures.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the crossbar between the north ring and Herden, a 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in a rear-run collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver rode on the crossing border towards the roundabout industrial area and took notice too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout at the roundabout.
He then crashed into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle at a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident were harmed by some 10 000 euros, the police informed.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to go and had to be towed.

Hearts will fight SFA for accusation of Neilson and be warburton cautiously in January commitments that could destroy the unity of the squad
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half of Aberdeen gave a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between them and Celtic.
Griffiths Plays Less on Disharmonie
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. He insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control, as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader of the standings.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they don't show any more highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It is because the Rangers are not there.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they are interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in the old company games, and it is not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-husband from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the standings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to come out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need to really support Celtic because that makes players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton cautiously with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, indicating that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious when signing new additions and insists that he did not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox squad.
Brentford's ex-boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate with what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with a retreat
Swansea striker Michu, talking to Celtic during the transfer period, indicated that he can withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not finished leaving Wales this summer.
Hearts posted on SFA Battle of Neilson's comments
The Hearts held 2:1 when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's red card was later picked up - the third red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains there, and insists: "I did not question any integrity, I have not commented on any performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible blow was rebuked after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Heart player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, a bar in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say that I'm not returning to Tynecastle if it's not playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board of directors still has confidence in the management team to shoot things - but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back on our toes," Donnelly said.
McInnes glad to "win nicely" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seven consecutive league victory, which earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the standing thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything in cup matches or leagues that haven't won this kind once."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as it rises overall.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the period from May to July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's 5.9 percent unemployment rate was above the UK's 5.5 percent, as shown by the figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
David Mundell, Secretary of State for Scotland, commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunk disturbed the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the sturgeons into custody.
A breath alcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 per mille.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per thousand and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm going to witness an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison springe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications available than places, a macabre lottery is held to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media venues from 12 to five.
Those who are selected will observe it emotionlessly.
I cannot.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's narrowest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I can't witness and be a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it is wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I did.
I do not want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would be guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I surely believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can contact.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded to come out of the Canning River after wet police pursue chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and swampy water, just a few meters from a police officer who tried to "persuade him gently to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were called to a household break incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water and said, 'I didn't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousins-Biathlon in the humorous planning.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt snap sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had restrained himself for 18 months because of the espionage accusations and did not want it to "look out like grapes hanging too high."
"I intended to say nothing about it, and I sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
They know it continued.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't, then I shouldn't be a coach.
I then have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had caused the bomb to go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Egrade eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables to provide information about what I am doing within my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously believe that I am a fraud.
If this is the case, they should certainly be trapped in their noses, because they have failed to try to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should this bring me to the view that it will become personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license from me and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-lasting cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching caused him to say that he could "throw a license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, referred to the racing day treatment rule "blasphemous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horses' legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees erroneously applied mud to the leg.
It could have been the case last night.
It could have been the case yesterday all day long.
But it also had it on race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here we have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after driver escape
The police arrested a man at the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent rider escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was heavily admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley highway.
The police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia faced police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with drivers' flight and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in hospital. It is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy beats back against rivals for claims for wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his player's tackle as an "Agenda setting" of two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the Storm players "ring competitions" with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the Storm team after his team won the final against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "pattern example" of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tack celeb and said that they were concentrated only on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches of his team was confident about him, since it said they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tackles a real focus, and this has caused us to turn the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It is already funny how this comes up again and again at this time of the year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "resustainable" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit shout.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters scored a higher result than Bronco's game against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points are something exciting?
For me it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them at a stage.
The Storm team has been free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with 200,000 dollar deposit after drug allowance
A man who may be threatened with a life sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail of 200,000 dollars.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potential life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire crowd and that the cafe may have been for a reason for a reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of fleeing at Maksimovic.
It has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a bail of 200,000 dollars as security together to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two people, it is clear that the condition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he is giving his Australian and his Serbian passport, contacting the police daily and holding on to a curfew from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Cabs tear apart
In a rear-end collision with three trucks on Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had slowed down in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to avoid the police at the last moment to the left.
The cache of the cause of the accident completely tore apart.
The driver was severely injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-North was completely closed for six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping phogg.
She watched it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered "finding" web searches that used terms for searching for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done so because it would lead to "pathophiles on the Internet" and then he "got to be a policeman to frighten them."
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he is addicted to frightening people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten pedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked to send more photos.
He said that he was doing it to lure them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added, "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the trembling and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, found itself guilty in the indictment, indecent images of children on 14. to have included June last year, on the 25th of May January this year violated the conditions and not in court for a hearing on 24. March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because one could argue that "no significant sexual element" was to be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in pre-trial detention for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Smugglers switch to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints at the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers allowed people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn along the border river Inn.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and wedges.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to the registration.
According to Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station again compared to the week starting on Wednesday.
Around 700 people arrived in the state capital until 8 a.m. alone, a speaker spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Foothills of Tropical Storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of gale-force gusts in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which has moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Steep storms and thunderstorms are especially expected in Baden.
According to DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour can be expected until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, the Swabian Alb and the Lake Constance district.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their new products at the IAA.
In 2015, there is mainly movement for compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular in demand: according to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were attributable to this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Audience Days 17th to 27th September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Group CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
To make the volume model selling well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive.
Opel holds outstanding an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which will start at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also includes three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model.
The second variant will be the second variant in the spring, which can also be seen at the IAA.
And what will be done on new compact cars besides the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door model in a conventional and a distinctly sporty GT version.
It will be registered very quickly next year, then as a combination.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits fully into the brand's design line.
The basic model will receive a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
It also offers a diesel of 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
The Baleno's sale in Europe will be released in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroen offshoot mainly handed to the front section: here, the radiator grille was re-drawn and the changed headlights equipped with LED technology.
The infotainment system was modernised in the interior, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, the IAA is accompanied by a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class and the Peugeot 308 GTI at the IAA.
Berlin-Tegel JVA: Five square metres of cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court agreed with an ex-inmate of the Tegel prison, which was housed in a small cell for months.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were only locked up in the too tight spaces for a few days (file no.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This made an ex-defyer successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a solitary cell with a floor space of around five square metres at the Berlin-Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated from spatially.
After that, according to his lawyer, the man who, according to his lawyer, was now returned to a larger cell, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His liability lawsuit because of the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges overturned the judgment of the Kammergericht Berlin and rejected the case there for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of man hurt.
Court of chamber now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were decisive for the compensation for the period in question, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "a withering of the legal protection of personality would be to be feared."
The court of the chamber must now clarify the amount of money compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they did not address compensation until April to an inmate because he was locked up naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of a decision.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court on Wednesday, which had certified a detainee inhumane accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009.
The police officer at the time was housed in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for three months daily for between 15 and 21 hours.
The Berlin prisons had also made the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly trapped in 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even beatings are said to have occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not filled due to a shortage of young talent, and 19 are to be omitted in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We are creating this"
Immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is happening to Germany?
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
In the face of the unusual challenge, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: we can do it, and we can do it."
The following overview provides what is happening in Germany.
According to various forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as previously built (250,000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is particularly tragic: every year 60,000 to 80,000 social housings fall out of the rental price fixed, and refugees will also apply for these particularly low housing.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the Pestel Institute's point of view, this is much too little: 80 000 social housing would have to be created every year, and the federal government would have to invest funding of 6.4 billion per year for this.
Scientists and Federal Building Minister agree on the fact that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial whether they are working in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of the immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turnaround in Germany: from the ban on work for refugees to recognise work.
While there used to be a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the obligation to reside the residence, which asylum seekers limited to one place of residence.
In society, the majority of the view has been gained in society, partly because of the shortage of skilled workers, that refugees should be given access to the labour market more quickly.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is still no sufficient supply of general and job-related language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often placed through personal contacts.
According to Thränhardt, the establishment of networks is therefore the ultimate route to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents who have fled their children into the daycare centres, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important for the uprooted parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the day-care centre, the management distributes flyers in different languages.
Should the demand for female kindergarten teachers increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without German language skills in welcome classes are prepared for lessons.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state forbidden asylum seekers or patienced to study - the only exception was previously Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Voluntary refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefit Act when they begin a study programme.
The latter basically do not receive a Bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to baptizing.
So far, patient refugees must have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to Bafög, from the 1. This range is reduced to 15 months on January 2016.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Students' Union.
Students should immediately receive Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to found an Islamic welfare association, which professionally takes care of the new arrivals.
Rights also include duties.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain possibilities of control.
This also includes the willingness to combat religious fundamentalism courageously.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to hold such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to forfeit here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more to society in the future than it does today.
This will also have to change the majority society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Gender Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for everyone: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-Ra-Racism Convention in Germany oblige Germany must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man-power and capacities, we can do it," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money must be included in the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals hand over health cards equally during the registration.
Performances could be settled later with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to fob off as many people with the limited catalogue of benefits that the Asylum Seeters Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the doctors are mainly causing the language barriers to being suffered.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants are being educated worse about their diseases than other patients.
It does not only have to be covered in clinics, but also in medical practices, interpreter costs have to be covered.
However, many refugees would be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and there are HIV enquiry among young people.
With the sometimes other diseases, German doctors would come along the basis of their training, but says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to detect." And as far as the doctors' shortage is concerned, the refugees may even be in sight of alleviation.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and several refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
According to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapists' Chamber (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most people suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children reaches traumatised in Germany.
Anyone who has a post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, acts and death fears, among other things.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe frightening and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, consultants or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would mostly decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to captivate every age group of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream into the ring on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chef.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current production of many occasions.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift to become enthusiastic is therefore in the blood of the family.
"It is important to us to take people away from their everyday routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours," emphasises the 27-year-old junior chef.
"Manegen cocktail with a cosmopolitan flair," says Director Reinhard Probst, who calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometre tour can now experience this flair.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
The Cuban duo wants to relax with the heroes of the silent films.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is supposed to take women's hearts by storm.
In addition to numerous salmon mountains, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with tact and flexibility.
Balancing on a ball with the unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little other and fascinates with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasises Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the keeping of circus animals are all too often an issue with various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not good, we are not doing well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are affectionately called, is read from the eyes if possible at all wishes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel good, it does not want it in the ring.
The ultimate commandment, then, provide good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zedbrastte, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the ring, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are wholeheartedly involved."
The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20. September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm to his ideas.
The programme starts on Sunday at 11 am and 4 pm.
Thursday is a family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are discounted.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives false speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of parliament was also clouded by opposition members' claims that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mugabe with booties.
Last month, they had booed him out and suspended him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The Movement for Democratic Change (MDG) spokesman Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their cell phones, which warned them, Mr. Mugabe's address.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentary members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and, as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to mine 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and will separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing corporate hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will provide a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, which will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion - Annual turnover and "will be concentrated on providing previously unrivalled, integrated technology solutions for companies," said the company's statement.
It dissolves a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical facilities and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the belief that narrow-focused companies deliver better performance.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates have to stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given its history, its participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then found it back to his old momentum during the previous season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the corresponding danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
An unpleasant pattern is also developing.
The study by Prime Minister Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007-08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs, which have most of them injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue over the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that it will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is set a rotation within the team.
Héctor BellerÃ3n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are allowed to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeaten after 41 games after the "unvincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has learned last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never worked.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar depictions in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the 2015 Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM campaign against a miserable life) announced the year of man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, focusing on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-funny and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much more profound effect on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy luck.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when making football in cozy chairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it, even if they often hold back to exploring their feelings completely.
As a telephone service staff explained to me:... "My listening role for people who feel depressed and are self-sufficient has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old phrase "I'm coping with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when people talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you are visiting Comedy Central Friends Festival this weekend with the completely redesigned setting to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for ’FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria scored at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass by Malmö.
Here are the match report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut, Di Maria made his PSG player who set the French champion on its way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani was in the 61st. Minute one header goal scored.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim for the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but also an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club, with which he began his illustrious career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect over the season," said Blanc.
"That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2:2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was called the man who could take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he ran into Marco Verratti's passport behind the Malmö defense before he completed beautifully past Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a big victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed in Anpiff with nine internationals in the field and was a heavy opponent lined up with a five-man defense and two low in the midfield.
But except a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who far belonged to Kevin Trapp's posts in the 34th. Minute passed, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up himself, with some misconceptions and poor deals, not least from Ibrahimovic, who patzated in the first half of no less than five attempts alone and was then abandoned after Cavani had set up after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he brought his teammates into play, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shot, which was made by Wiland in the 52nd place. Minute was diverted past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic fished a left-wing flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result down before substitution player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recorded a goal at the end.
Malmö coach, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norweger said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying matches are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by collapsing commodity prices, collected 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt redemption plan.
The London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion dollars to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China’s economic downturn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the 2.5 billion dollar selling stock as part of the broader plans to repay around one third of its 30 billion dollars in debt.
The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by around half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was obviously on the verge of signing up to Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two club world champions, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already before the 2008 European Championship before the departure from Barcelona.
"I was told that Bara wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything back then, we didn't do anything," he says.
And this was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
However, the change did not materialise.
And the decisive man is working for the German record champion today: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Baria has signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's when he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008/2009 would have been running with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the pitch, switched off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the royal class triumph in the end.
Matt Damon Plays Variety in Filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she wasn't needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight's Sunday Night, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, namely a black protagonist in the project's choose screenplay.
"When we talk about diversity, then you do it with the cast of the movie and not at the cast of the show," Damon assured.
Brown responded shocked, with offended disbelief and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay, when the comments of the actor of The Martian consolidated.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - whoever the director will be - how they treat the character of the Harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directional rights to the film; Damon replied that their director "end could give us something that we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproving of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's WHEN SO ISS that it hurts."
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come to a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged legislatures and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether the group should be seen as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not clear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and help help Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million dollars.
The competition show, which is just their 7. Completed the season, had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task included climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britt finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero talked to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the 1 million dollars in the Grand Prize.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than 10,000 dollars or had come to life," said Isaac E! over his pile of money.
So all sudden .. how I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course, do not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, they will take the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it receives the great bonus.
I don't think he has any grudge about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
He received crowds of awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it is Isaac."
And I think Isaac felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight-season, the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Previously, they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday they played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within an half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, even if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit the 1/3 Innings 6 times and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strongly this year," said Simon.
It is hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and so I want to go into the game in a concentrated way.
The designated Tiger Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-piece hit game by Martinez, since he hits four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6. July had.
"He has swung the wood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (percussion), looked much better in the bullp, and he got it right into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left section.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colour, and Simon took his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran Mauer, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie hit Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run to the right-handed Drew Veruben.
With a pair of runners and the closing run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading Major League 27th. Time this season that Plouffe beat a Double Play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Mauer managed an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4.
However, the right-handed stabbed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
At the start of the game, Detroit benefited from an unfeigner Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been deleted from the injured list before the game after missing for a back condition for more than a month.
"Obviously not the beginning I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I started going and felt that I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they received the lead-off batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 successful series with the Runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers increased in the second, scored a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center foam detector Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't do well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliable right-hander A.J. eight.
There were three runs at Hughes in six hits and one walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez was eliminated due to injury to the thrower shoulder.
He is said by Dr. James Andrews who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder graving, is to be activated for the launch on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the list of injured to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was in exchange with LHP David Price on 30. July was acquired
He has since the 20th August was missed due to a strain in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to stay in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected to come to Wednesday for the night.
The people who have travelled therein will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She counted with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared in this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stay there.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the Gießen Regional Council, which was responsible for the initial reception, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive thinking about military options for action must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago, it was glad that the chalice of military participation in Germany passed by.
"Now the conflict is crashing on our doorstep," he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television station ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary now.
Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that is what it is agreed," she explained.
Regarding an agreement after Germany could accept a certain number of refugees per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, applied for a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU member states have not yet been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis.
The EU interior ministers want to next Tuesday (22. September) take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee team in Germany, the federal government wants to provide greater support to the states in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government would manage this together with the Länder, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliberations with the prime ministers in the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel underlined those people who need protection would also get them.
But those who have no prospects of staying cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly divided in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia during the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that they would also lock the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is part of the EU other than Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent smugglers from sought alternative routes via Romania, said Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Spacecraft "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
A global ocean spills under the ice sheet of Saturn's moon Enceladus.
This is what are closed by researchers from observations by the space probe "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon easily staggers around the ring planet on its orbit.
Although this frenzy movement is only small, it is nevertheless too big for a continuously solid celestial body, it is stated in a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the expert journal "Icarus".
It has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
For example, "Cassini" had already discovered ice vulcans at the south pole of Saturn's moon in 2006, which sproutes of water vapour and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich had to renounce the Offensad Rama actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation had caused an inflammator violation in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "four weeks of forced break."
"It hits us hard, Rama is a severe loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Bild" newspaper with regard to the possible commitment of an uninalogy professional.
As a guest of training, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills."
Goal hunter Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his concussion next week.
The Austrian national player is to go into running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent clash on the head.
However, contrary to the first fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - mangoes contain lots of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to pay attention to your lean line, they are often advised against.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Above all, however, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Anyone who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too solid and pleasant to smell.
The peel colour alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
You should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS once again hires up to 95,000 outers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are sought.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce by 95,000 aids for the holiday season.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor, FedEx, have been making arrangements earlier than last year to be prepared for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had made harsh criticisms of the parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then striking cold front
In the coming night, the Föhn breaks through the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and the night of Thursday, the foehn blower blows through the hair dryer valleys with storm strength.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, we crosses a striking cold front, which brings strong rains, wind gusts and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a message, Switzerland is currently on the front site of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the north side of the Alps, the Fehn River breaks through the valleys on the night of Wednesday.
As a result, the hair dryer blows in the hair dryer valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h until Thursday morning, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland, sometimes with more than 100 km/h.
The foehn can penetrate into the adjacent central land in places, and even hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While stormy hair dryer keeps summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees in the north on Wednesday, the humidity at the south of the Alps begins to accumulate.
This is where rain occurs, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, some 100 litres of rain per square metre must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large rainfall has already fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the foehn blower goes out of air, as a cold front rolls with strong, partly thunderous rain from west to east via Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decrease significantly.
The following days are autumnal in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south it will become sunny and warmer on weekends with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
In the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honoured as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome, next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been applied for by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran parish in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes as a minority could often live their faith in the hidden for centuries.
The square becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He found the city to be a deteriorating bellable of sins at that time.
According to historians, his negative impressions were encouraged by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then ushered in the split of the Western Church with his theses against the trade in indulgences.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilt) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has received his "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms - which is by no means synonymous with "lustful" pictures.
On the contrary, adapted to the respective topics can seem quite bleak.
Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years, for which he has made a subjective-art selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
The result is cycles that devote themselves to topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or fatherless.
With this, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books.
Above all, there is the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present day, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Old Painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quote by Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewellery cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrhuter Order.
"The education ever happened with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I tried to come to terms with me, perhaps to get along with the Lord Father again."
His second concern is to help art to gain more importance again in a fast-moving time: "The perception of pictorial worlds is characterised by advertising today, and that is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to let themselves be "falled in" the pictures, let them work on them, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost admitted to being a lover of Otmar Alt's art "always" at the presentation of the Otmar Old Bible at the Otmar Alt Foundation: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Alt had not taken care to fully grasp the Bible, but rather chose the themes that are important to him, including mysterious themes.
"This was not a collaboration on an equal footing," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text merely explains." A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler from Luther publishing house, this work is an invitation to "deepen your life and to find freedom".
For Möhler, Otmar Alt's pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that was presented on 15 May. November in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction starts for BMX track is near
Plans made, found space, companies commissioned, Erdhügel modeled for a circuit modelled: One year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX railway, it was already over.
Barks in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill deported, new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the first councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to inform the children's and youth committee.
"I hope that this year still happened," she said.
Working at the former indoor pool should then be started without an "another memorial break".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga will send a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is responding to the most affecting situation in Germany and assures politicians help in tackling the problems that are to be tackled.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that doesn't concern me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This must be interested in every individual to get this topic under control," said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September. He wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively in Berlin in September.
"I am in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State, Ms Özouz, and the Chancellor."
"The issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football could and wants to help.
However, the decisive course must set politics.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Brewer Foundation we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," said Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesliga teams also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are sending a clear signal when they are printed "We help - Ã...reswelcome" on the left jersey sleeves instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evidentness".
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, nobody should look away."
"We Bundesliga clubs, no, we need to use our appeal, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large community work of German football".
It is great that all 36 licensing associations in their towns started their own projects.
It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" we have spent is lived in football.
"That is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost the left eye to the left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell after midnight on a glass of water that he wore in his left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding to death, was powerless, then dragged himself out into the street - he told us that way last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
However, McDermott could do his work.
"At the beginning of October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is involved in the meeting and "fully able to work".
In an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition), McDermott announced that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm fully in my job for SAP."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It is important to him to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of "SZ": "Everyone can happen."
"It is important to get up again when you have fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen other than battle ...
Magnussen tweeted a photo and said that he had suffered the injury when he had fallen off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible as reserve drivers for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on weekends, as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally smashed.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the football Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (79.00/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we can't resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
If Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect him to return to training on Friday".
Given the high strain of its professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stem elevator on the Reus position.
He announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular defending Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," praised the football teacher the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all European League games in the future.
He is most likely to contest the second game.
Mid-pointer Julian Weigl considers midfielder Julian Weigl to be a comprehensive statement that the final entry for BVB must be the goal in the Europa League: "That's not so that Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to grab the title."
Robot cars: Government wants to be a pioneering role for Germany
According to the Federal Government, Germany is to be technologically a pioneer in the transformation of cars.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor trade fair "new age of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure fewer traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a swift change to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being built on Autobahn 9 in Bavaria.
To ensure that the driver "no additional liability risks are imposed", the Federal Government wants to "check and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to ensure that the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to advocate an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "only to be expected so far after 2020".
The authors of the study estimate the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German location to around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport policymaker Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 percent only expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of those surveyed expect autonomous cars by 2025, and 33 percent in the USA.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to relinquish control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could be 15 percent imagined in flowing traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
Well, every fourth would not leave the car to the control under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to win the title fights of the 25th anniversary of the current status. September to 4 September October only open in individuals.
The final decision is to be taken at the latest on 22. September fall.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys learned it in the morning."
"However, we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, this is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the seating list in Yekaterinburg, also reminded us of the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"At that time Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"We should orientate ourselves at that," explained the world ranking fifth.
The British national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has caused a serious injury to the right leg.
At the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno in a tackkling and converted after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a shin fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old teammate.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figures-gilar cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfit - and with the fact that he was put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"In the past, it was bleached, now it is real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which runways from the 18th coast, from the 18th to the city. To be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation in September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was opposed, because "For me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made a stop in Montreal and Paris, Canada.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits provide an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellently choreographed Gesamtkunstwerk, for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to style the dolls, for example, a stylist was engaged in special purposes.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have checked 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special treat: a leather trouser outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, timid fashionable attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
Playing with a doll was not allowed by his parents.
He later taught himself the design of fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, but of course I bought them.
For his first fashion show, he was unable to pay for the models.
They were given nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, who, for example, they processed into blankets and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion tip Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a greater role, was then suppressed by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style erases, forms an increasing potential for orders.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
They already make up half of all orders with us.
Together with nine other companies, Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze and Embroidery.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have collapsed.
Private specialty shops and also the wholesale trade almost do not exist anymore.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Nowadays, mass-produced goods are much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively by chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
Enough reasons for new paths.
The industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch office of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences in Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
In order to counteract the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
The result is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter rekindled the historic snowball peak.
The machine embroideres small spheres in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "I could not do anything next to me with traditional Plauener Spitze".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it coins the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a memorabilia.
With this, I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Plauen lace.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel, which plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy needs to open up broadly to the outside world to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business start-ups," he said in a speech at the 16th century. Meeting of the Central Leader Group for the Deepening of a Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting start-ups and pushing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list to regulate market access, balancing border control policy, promoting state-owned enterprises (SOE), taking up private capital, and overhauling the residents' reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role to allocate resources, ensures a governance of the law and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
A further areas for private investment will be opened up as part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to appoint professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby expecting a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison for consumers.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has been submitted a corresponding working paper on the EU, sharply criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy are passed on to pregnant women and young children at full force," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt from Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic policy reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury today that around 50 percent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the limit values still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
According to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Foodwatch.
However, Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low-strained that they already meet the planned maximum values today.
Lowering small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that helps the economy alone," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which accumulates strongly through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn childhood.
However, the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is released into the environment, mainly through coal combustion.
According to a written reference by the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal-fired power plants are renouncing more than six tons of mercury per year to the Green parliamentary member Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, the Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already one of the most reported health risks in the EU PACF warning system.
