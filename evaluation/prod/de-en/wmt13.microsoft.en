A Republican Strategy to Confront Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies by citing the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by affirming that voter fraud in the U.S. is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
By the way, the lawyers of the Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the USA in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting elections in each state.
With this in mind, since 2009, the majority of American governments have promulgated new laws that complicate the registration or ballot process.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day, and deny the right to vote to citizens who have a court record.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states that force voters to show photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to get the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of individuals with incomes of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters who are increasingly voting for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their institution-issued photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states sponsored laws that eliminated voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped register some 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of new voters registered in 2010 fell by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed legislation aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in Florida's 2008 general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, even though they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo identification to be shown.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed and see them as a clear goal to influence the results in the countries decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer screening: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes has erroneous results, with false negative or false positives that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be taken or not?
We sought the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were numerous confounding factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that with follow-up after 12 years, the probability of metastasis forming is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That's why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can be left untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases more likely to opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested active surveillance and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
That's why I still recommend taking the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be performed.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool that makes it possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and got enough exercise.
"If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It greatly damages people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colonal, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colonal cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing Grimm or rectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more of an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to your doctor about your concerns and family history.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzing the Higgs boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the Standard Model—our best or "least false" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter—but has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still lacking to be completely sure.
Still, let's assume it's actually the Higgs, as there's seemingly little risk of being wrong, and let's see what it's all about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that means that two objects cannot exist in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard, as you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" largely consists of some of its properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, called Fermione, who obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other move the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs website The Particle Adventure (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing): the mesons, which we will not cover here, and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
However, it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates or changes direction with an electric charge, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at that very location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't—for example, a piece of paper would never hold itself to the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (such as the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all this research "be good for", asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately study any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who fervently hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major flaws, as it offers no explanation for gravity (oops!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is none.
By the way: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle — who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-wave laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 — has already told us that in the beginning, the laser was seen more as a "lab gimmick."
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 while working in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its Committee on Dying with Dignity, Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his medication, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea be cured, as it is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"That depends on the person's ability" to take a step backwards, he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in palliative care, great events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more desires in life," she says, before accepting to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
Nevertheless, she expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy, in the next few days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers offers personal hygiene and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little when you consider that one day we're all going to die.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is granted oral care with brandy or Pepsi, depending on his wishes.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
At Victor-Gadbois Home, no two days are the same.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family reunion in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while toasting in his honor, a young man of 36, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel worriedly.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when they reach the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal Area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major inadequacy in Quebec's health care that has caused several doctors specializing in palliative care to view the passage of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting to switch to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days in great pain without any action being taken to alleviate her.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, despite the worst prognosis, several oncologists treat their patients doggedly until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she said.
However, she had told me that I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver for not acceding to that request after their pain was relieved by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal Area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain management.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which amounts to euthanizing the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was made possible by a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road department, companies in the construction industry, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has fallen apart since drastic measures were taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec congressman and former head of the Montreal Police Department.
The scandal was uncovered by him as a result of an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road works in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret party funding and bribery of officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he points out, "the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars on contracts," because some have curbed their instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping it will succeed in "revealing the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troops of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.
Then there are the police officers of the "Marteau force", which since 2009 has caused the Montreal "sewerage cartel" to be more restrained in artificially inflating contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out scores of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Department of Roads, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
The latter caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the operation of the 'system' for obtaining public contracts.
He himself spent several years paying 3% of the value of contracts received in Montreal to a Mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had a hand everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts the cost of which has been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption functioned smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail to the commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 from the construction company in return for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials at the Department of Highways have admitted that they allowed themselves to be bribed by artificially inflating bills by 30-40% with false benefits.
In addition, an organiser of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately ignoring a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, plunging Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal legislators to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled from 2010 against the sale of a municipal property that was acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will ultimately be conducted, she says that it is "pulling a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits".
She says the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need an investigation unit dedicated only to Montreal, as well as oversight to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who are aware of the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that this was only a weak copy of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be circulating in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public procurement and financing of parties: "We cannot fall lower; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress at their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements spur me on every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, it's even easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I don't burst into enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the centre of INF Clairefontaine's preparatory training to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's newcomers are used to playing games at very high levels.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
As a result, a player like me has to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by assistant coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Naturally.
Ancelotti instills respect in all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of PSG's season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken away our place as the leader.
But we are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the knockout rounds in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish first in our group before Porto so that we can play the second leg of the round of sixteen as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to take concrete shape.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it's really important to us to win that title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has had an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it's normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find something to blame us, it's certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what else people expect.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We showed strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has failed to qualify for the knockout rounds for two seasons and has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead at the break!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we finally won it.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was close to my heart to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting some playing time.
I saw things there from which I emerged stronger.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learned our lesson from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What is your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the helm of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Will the draw (1-1) forced in Spain on 16 October be an opening match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I had never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling is possible without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the participants.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's price fell to 2 dollars five months later before recovering to around ten dollars today (prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in doing so in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged back) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the ledger, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction are electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the account book of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "chopped up".
The goal is to find the number that results in a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to cheat, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible to one hundred millionth, which leaves some leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, which is a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a company that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, making them cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards rethinking hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to catch on, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now regarded as high in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow suit at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees and financed with French loans, was carried out properly.
The convoys of trucks and tanks flown over by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influx into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was at war due to the fighting of the various rebellious groups.
Their seizure of power was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban share a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into profiteers by seizing government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of massive American subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have benefited from American grants: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be given jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television, with its Turkish series depicting a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization along the lines of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 50s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are not in place, and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Priority will be given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to take possession of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore locally, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' high schools, the Institute of French at the Universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2000 meters.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which they say is their wish, it would be necessary to continue small, well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid in their favour.
A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game from President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put all its eggs in one basket.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt his final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, amended several times, for almost two years now, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only created an even greater division in the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law underfoot."
Its supporters assert that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as protest rages across the country.
According to an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited power", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities and civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to reach a quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, the articles were mostly passed unanimously.
Commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... in the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the principal source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" is the response of liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place via other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, especially with regard to the verification of conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are invited to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At present, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics, some of whom have been trained in the French system," reassures Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, editor's note].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In line with the military's wishes, the audit of the defense budget will not be submitted to parliament, but to a national defense council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have demanded.
The latter also express their fears about the text, which they regard as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article refers to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comforts and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Bowing to the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding party, walking on water, calming the sea storm, and fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to His disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Passion or Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The trail starts at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the judgment was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for Jews – the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes there, which then come true.
Take a journey to the heights
The ruins of the Massada fortress form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
All others are taken by cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the mountaintop.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (parliament).
There are kept ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is exhibited the collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Al Basha bath, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bath servants.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most harrowing chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the Children's Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were exterminated in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for your health
Israel's three main recreational areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, bathing in the Red Sea is also done in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and people swim there all year round.
By the way, with a location of 417 meters below sea level, this unusual sea is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore easily carries even non-swimmers on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm stressed nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old city of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city ran the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda here, with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is said to be good to all those who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries for photo ops.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre now hosts evening concerts and operas.
Watchlist for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is better not to take in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you can usually get around by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a rapid tram and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stations connecting the Lower City with the Upper Town.
Strictly speaking, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a journey of up to 1.5 hours including transfers.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed on Saturdays in Israel.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is suspended.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and pubs, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and foods containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have a choice of different dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and unmolested.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
A rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the brand.
Insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in their homeland.
On December 1, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test attesting to knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
You have to take not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who obtained their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
All the examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; More than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question in the press several times before the law came into force: What is the point of all this?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring for both Russians and guest workers?
Above all, countering spokesmen for the migration authority, it is a matter of reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who, under the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure months without food or documents with dozens of his peers, toiling 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, you are promised one thing, and on arrival you are scammed, your passports are confiscated and do not receive the promised wage," confirms Tolib Shwaripov, head of the Tajik Migration Authority's main labor migration administration.
Don't complain, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they not only do not speak the language of the destination country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a decent primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to be in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "Access prohibited for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The members of the Russian police know that most of our documents are forged and we are not registered, and this leads to cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Don't shy away from the costs of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them in vain: each migrant hoping to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot simply be purchased.
For now, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fail the test the first time that they will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in crime extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs is planning to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
This is the authorities' reaction to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
Irina Yarovaya, chairwoman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, supported the proposal and promised that the amendments to the weapons law would soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "tightening the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various gun associations - demand that the authorities refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed during six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals from using the black market.
At present, according to the authors, any weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a web page accepting gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from police armories and directly by law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons depots.
Explosions occurred frequently in many military camps.
"There is evidence that some cases involved arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Nowadays there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore squander their weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
According to investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market got there through the "fault of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work," the report says.
According to the researchers' data, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are due to theft during weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop, who asked not to be named, assures that weapons found during illegal excavations have not been bought for a long time because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get supplies from an arms depot.
An ensign buys a weapon, for example a TT pistol.
The weapon is exhibited and passed through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun into town and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"Like in a luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had been looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the Begovaya station, where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I only found out the price for the weapon there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and arrange to meet with a code like "Ivan Ivanovich, who lets it be known that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I am currently even getting some brass knuckles through an acquaintance I trust.
He also only delivers the brass knuckles to me because he knows that I won't blow the whistle on him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried his hand at buying illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which "all sorts of things" were depicted.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, I drive with the seller into the woods, and that's where we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results to websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are required nor are there face-to-face meetings.
"You just need the right amount of money," reads the ad on the "Buy Combat Pistol or Rifle" website.
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Without a license, of course," asks user "Ivan" (verbatim quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are using the service in droves.
People come feeding like hungry fish and then end up in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard about the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can also come away empty-handed and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy weapons are using the service in droves.
"People come feeding like hungry fish and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, prices of 100 to 900 US dollars can be expected when buying illegal firearms.
According to Dmitry Kizlov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons depots by middle-ranking overseers.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the period from January to October 2011, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
One in four U.S. teenagers sits behind Mc Donald's cash register at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell even further or whether they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of forming unions.
So far, this branch of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when sales took place in the US that attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to scuffles.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, walked off the job and, together with unions and left-wing activists, went on strike at branches of the chain targeting low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees only shop at their own workplace.
The prices and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests demanded wage increases and expressed anger that the contribution to company health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour couldn't afford that increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That is about 1.1% more than they donate now for wages.
If Walmart were to pass on the wage increases completely to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Compared to today, this would mean additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars per year.
Proponents of Walmart note with satisfaction that there were protests in only nine states and these did not cause the company any losses.
Black Friday lasted in his store from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart checkouts carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees walked off the job and that the protest action was just "another PR ploy" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are undesirable in this progressive city and therefore non-existent), but McDonald's and other budget restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually being raised, but not too much, and on average, their ordinary employees in New York are paid $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get by in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all U.S. teenagers stood behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the teens still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly come across people who complain that they have to make do with this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday outside the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants be paid a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits management from standing in the way of this goal and reprimanding or firing union members.
On the other hand, corporate management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were also loud protests in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan that day.
The culmination of the protests was a noon gathering outside the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York City Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support fast food workers so they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, far from all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"So far, the brain has only been moderately outsmarted"
The topic of augmented reality, popular among followers of modern technologies, has recently been perceived through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, speaking to Shahram Izadi, head of the interactive 3D technologies group at Microsoft's laboratory in Cambridge, it becomes clear that the glasses were just a transit station for the company's scientists.
It appeals to the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has taken interaction to a physical level, much still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, this requires that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first of all, we should get rid of those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It is certainly not the one-size-fits-all solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all bystanders about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its specific niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of sweeping ones.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, however, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and speech.
-How so?
- For example, would we ask me to hand you this bubble can?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does this mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that make it possible to capture people's reactions more accurately.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- Based on your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your expectations of modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also along the Z axis must be taken into account.
Speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with an adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or exacerbate the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera tilts to see how that helps us determine a position three-dimensionally.
- If I remember correctly, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of applying augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in your raised hand on the go, but I think the following: The best variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we could switch from glasses to smartphones via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (private things only you can see), but at the same time also their weakness, because augmented reality by means of glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to mere mortals.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method at the moment is the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection surface.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "images in the air" something tangible, for example, the interference of some directional ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently still as weak as if someone were blowing over the palms of their hands.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outwit the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it like that yet.
Here lies another task that we will have to contend with for a long time to come, namely to make a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outsmarted, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The select list has already included high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes extend beyond the city's borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who can be found sometimes at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the Summer Garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s. Early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures up a smile on the faces of his fellow citizens through his presence on the street and puts them in a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became a St. Petersburg barrel organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates slightly from the gray norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I'm drawn to theatre, fashion, music, actually everything except literature.
- And all this was combined in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room at Pushkinskaya 10, and until the renovations there was a musical-artistic club for the bohemian, the house of the Petersburg bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for play-back, wore tight jerseys and among them was the now hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and I was at my peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In this day and age, it's easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by requiring everyone to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves to the outside and not to the inside of the person.
But perhaps one should not shake hands with a person, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears through disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the bohemians loved one and the common people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But several thousand come to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything perishes.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov at one collector's house.
I started with images that usually don't come until the end of my career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
That is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what is Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that real experts are needed.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have some who could be experts, but their way is blocked because there is a need for more high-level experts who properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a breeding ground.
Art can hardly grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board go in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises, how can we reproduce in weightlessness or on the surrogate planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could inhabit, at least hypothetically.
"Namely Mars and Venus," says Vladimir Surdin, a research associate at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively conducive to life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers initially dealt with the question of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Half a century earlier, experiments had already been carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how weightlessness affects embryo development.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find support; it must be able to stand on its feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sykhev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Without a solid surface, the chicks rolled over wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then stopped the whole thing because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sykhev about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last brood cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must continue," notes Vladimir Sykhev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
In contrast to animals, humans could do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question: Can it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered that question," says space veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts who went well after long flights and had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the cosmonauts' preparation center is an obligatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults find water pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness to the fact that life on land rose from the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid in the mother's womb for about 9 months, and that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth to the first swim.
"That's not enough time to forget anything," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
While weightlessness is a much more natural state for a newborn child, the woman cannot do without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles regress enormously quickly and thus the ability to squeeze the child out decreases.
Well, let's avoid this with birth-inducing aids.
The birth could, for example, also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is Valery Polyakov's not insignificant question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling gravity, the organism cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a suitsuit in orbit for training like an adult.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment that we are carrying out together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will give birth to a disabled person, a completely non-conformist person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it becomes reality when the Earthlings set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes the home for their descendants born in space.
NKÚ chief: Control of the black system fails due to the fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
Speaking for Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), says.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied correctly - and I don't think that's the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar conclusion seems to be reached by a joint inspection by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites Prime Minister Petr Nečas' attitude towards the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come and hinder the work of the Assay Office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What was it all about?
This is a parallel audit that we started about two years ago.
Put simply, it is a matter of European legislation determining how public contracts are to be handled. National legislation is based on this. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this and, although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws here may even be a bit stricter and more perfect, but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly establish new and more precise rules. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What does this project mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the law and to lower and balance thresholds when this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering order thresholds does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remain higher.
You talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an authority similar to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which has a similar structure to ours and also has a college that is only formed slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. these courts of auditors also exist in the individual federal states - this is what distinguishes the German system from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds that correspond to our state resources.
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities in our country, are subject to the control of the state audit offices.
As far as the German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a role model in some respects, but it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better at everything.
Is this perhaps because the examiners are better there?
Certainly not, but as I said: I don't particularly like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a role model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from working with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act have for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this amendment has only been in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our audits.
Since our checks take place retrospectively, a certain delay must be expected here.
So far, we have felt the effects more in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control instrument "Identification of risks of inefficiency" and used it to examine and analyse almost 14 000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to scrutiny are accountable to the promoter (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act amounts to a violation of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
In my opinion, not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Where is the way out?
First of all, let's say which way is not effective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then the chairman of the government cannot simply come and hinder the work of the Assay Office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we are missing.
On the roads there is occasional icy ice, but mostly they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is partly snow and ice.
For the most part, however, the roads are well passable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were well passable this morning, occasionally there was snow and ice.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a bit warmer.
It no longer snows in the region, and at lower altitudes only a thin blanket of snow remains.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are currently fully passable.
However, attention should be paid to bridges, for example, where the roadways are sometimes icy and slippery.
All traffic routes of the second and third road class, including the mountain roads, are also passable.
On these roads, however, icy or extended snow remnants remain in sections.
Increased attention is therefore required, especially at higher altitudes.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a risk of icy conditions, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes still a layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate informs on its website.
The road maintenance agencies warn drivers of icy conditions, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
Icy roads can occur especially on second and third road roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory.
An extended layer of snow lies at high altitudes on the roads of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov counties.
In Eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or bright, and it remains largely rain-free.
The temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Plzeň District
The roads in the Pilsen Region are now easily passable, but locally increased attention is required and the driving style must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures dropped afterwards, it can come on the roads to icy conditions.
Fog is also expected locally, but visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district road maintenance departments.
The D5 motorway is practically fully passable, but the road maintenance agencies recommend increased attention between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
The roads of the first road class are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the counties of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice may occur in sections.
The roads of the second and third road classes are damp, and therefore the indication of possible icy sections also applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc District
Today, drivers who are heading towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc district have to reckon with slush.
After the use of gritting vehicles, slush remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow forced the road maintenance agencies to use, in the district of Šumperk fell according to the road administration about 3 cm of fresh snow.
In the other areas of the district, the lanes are usually fully passable.
"In the Šumperk district, remnants of snow remain at high altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers in the direction of Jeseník must expect slush," an employee of the Šumperk road administration told ČTK today.
Her colleagues in Jeseník County also had to leave at night, and according to her, the roads up to high altitudes are free and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully passable, but in the Šternberk district, drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads here are still damp.
District Ústí nad Labem, District Liberec
In northern Bohemia, the road maintenance agencies report several poorly navigable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures will remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so snow and ice will remain on the roads. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Uplands, however, no problems are reported, and the roads there are usually dry.
So far, no traffic disruptions have been reported.
Icy ice is reported in particular from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless skies and frost at night.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from the I/13 road on the border of the districts of Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were pushed onto the road by the snow load.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the end of the world taking place in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we humans like to jump on so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we tend to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a nationwide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is predicted to end on December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts should be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally probably by me, then we developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, which people can also help us with www.e-tap.cz purchase.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world entitled "The end of the world falls out".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem will be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together in a live broadcast by Czech Television.
The lyrics of the hymn were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings along...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we organize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building is to be built, into which we will then move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you use to select them?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
Everything else can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Of course, we also have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its infancy in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not handicapped accessible. There, it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to be alone in the city center.
It is not even self-evident that you let a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, associations are also springing up there to try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things we are lagging behind...
It should also be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in this we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but it's only when major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks that things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years, what motivated you to form a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and play the saxophone, among other things, I founded a music club together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, it gets a bit out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; In addition, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you achieve something and this is not visible to the outside world, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; This is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, it is progress not only for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you can't compromise on many things and you also have to demand a certain discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they realize that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. This cannot be prevented.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
At the end, all three venues will be connected via live connection and a joint interpretation of the anthem "The end of the world falls out" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for equipping a multifunctional educational centre for the disabled, which will be built under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this space agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA). Poland is thus the second member state from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's journey into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were involved in space travel, although they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was honored, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the draisine.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered projectiles.
The research was carried out by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the surviving documents it can be seen that the research had advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted, of course, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, Rohozinski's design of a photoelectric hunting missile appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocketry were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated at the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At that time, the first satellite technology projects were already underway, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Agency PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor 1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm, and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport compartment with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude of all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a launch weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Community Works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on community service.
This decision provoked a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wages), there are price tensions.
This concept means a situation in which the manufacturer tries to compete economically by importing cheap goods by 'undercutting' competition in order to gain a larger market share and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy cheaply there, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparably high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they cause to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own populations and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments surrender their own populations to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This happens on the one hand through economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand through the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food distribution points for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which employees receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income up to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary staff employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all southern EU states will undoubtedly amount to the same state of affairs in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse in their social level, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or starve for a pittance on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
This naturally begs the question of where this capital comes from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital is completely absent, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa in general, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own national economy, and that a planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual prejudice, legislation in which practically everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to a lack of finances, a state ministry commissions private legal companies closely intertwined with industry to draft laws.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are currently quickly finding themselves in a situation that Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by force.
For bribes, by unlawful fraud of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption rampated unrestrained, and the people went to the polls with votes they had already bought." "People of character did not apply for office, so that as a result of this decline the state had no consul for eight months" ... "People really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was autocracy, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian was thinking of Pompey, but the strong man was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with autocracy.
As it turns out, today's society, as in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is not in a position to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who make no effort whatsoever for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already looming.
What is particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are completely ignorant of the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and modern history.
The repeal of the Law on Community Works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises, or ever could arise, from violence," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "... lest we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be one," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is guilty and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing; After all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing regions, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the onset of the violence themselves.
My aim is to give readers a look behind the scenes, a look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of country in the Middle East are most useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost a history of struggle for power.
In any epoch we can make out an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it did not arise within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out in particular, which could be called the head of the octopus (I do not know if anyone else is above them, but I do not rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or arm themselves for them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi only four remained,  in the meantime, Russia has placed its central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay for it with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (read: state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Rep. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global lust for power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was aimed in particular at breaking the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war was intended to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide their comforts and luxuries and would not consume so many resources),  create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the apron here) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always make the situation worse (see founding the Fed so that crises like the one they triggered in 1907 are not repeated).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War by murdering the heir to the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make it easier to ignite the Second World War, the bankers had politics create a latent conflict situation by imposing gigantic war reparations on Germany; in this way they created the conditions of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans on a sufficiently strong leader who named the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to assume the function of a fifth column and also took it to ignite the conflagration of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which one branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain on which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to assess; in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line of battle, similar to World War II, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, starting with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
A distinction must be made here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as in our country, the people, only put their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-prone, loyal politician loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything he can to ignite a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and in which, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide,  The Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies pass, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light do David Rockefeller's words from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! If you have sense, consider the number of the animal.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The Movie Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the installation of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the ensuing fiasco in the violent attempt to free hostages only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in bringing the refugees out of Iran; they were helped by an extravagant story to conceal their true identities - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew that allegedly visited filming locations for a science fiction film in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "caper movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar play such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, in the corridors, on the phone...
With this film, Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable reboot of his career.
A ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime thriller Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that is not set in the director's native Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that set this director's previous films apart from the standard of Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this intuition in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, while still conveying the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film stick at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a telephone call in America, or the chase on the runway, seem a bit artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its overly wide spread, due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some of its traction as a result. It's a film that you can follow with some interest, appreciating the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive today and as proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the all-powerful and omniscient secret services are.
Guidelines for ballooning, bananas and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls a survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organize the competition "Most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This is the idea that came up with the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is in charge of organising this survey, told Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose less risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is subsequently harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also been levelled at the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with veto threats).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this poll may be last year's EU regulation, which, according to balloons, must be labeled when selling them that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American study, according to which balloons are the leading cause of suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairgrounds.
Curious ideas also exist at home
Also relatively absurd is a directive that affects European civil servants themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU is not allowed to use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated the EU regulation on the extent of food stocks on the territory of a member state in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum level of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, then exceeded the specified volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organisers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest had been very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally accommodated the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for subsidies was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically funds for the preparation of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the member states, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve more recognition, according to some experts.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by individual member states during the budget negotiations.
Emotions are also aroused in this country by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this battle.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to rename the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now also includes Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or Saaz hops.
Pardubice gingerbread or Hořice rolls can boast of an EU trademark.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Senator, how does one come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer stand by and watch the republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves roaming free while raising people's taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I'm already over 40, independent and independent, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then made your way straight to the castle.
Aren't you turning your back on your voters?
I told myself all along that I would take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would run for president if I am elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and the strongest possible mandate.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people complain in the pub and in front of the TV, but put down everyone who wants to change something.
Then there are the media that want to rob you of honor and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was said that I bribed journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You took up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations of over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no authority in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce bills.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I campaigned for the travel guide to remain a free trade, and this was achieved.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-partisan, I have far greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country from each party without pigeonholing and party dogmas.
As a person in politics, do you see yourself as more on the right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone belongs to the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you have just said?
If you draw up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
I can call this populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you are left with nothing but slogans.
And that won't get you very far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the leaders of parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine in law the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the addressees would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality who points out grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I cannot achieve anything alone; That's why I've talked to several well-known personalities about whether they would like to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jančura, who declined due to work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the polls at all, and those who left mostly voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the past of every potential party member, nor do I have the money to do so.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; there are only 20,000 CZK on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You talk about declarations of assets, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private fortune at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million. And then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I always liked James Bond, how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to run the campaign from my own resources.
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to make a living?
Didn't you say you were going to scale back those activities?
But this is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
As president, however, I would stop my activities altogether.

MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one today voluntarily goes to one of these old-style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that hardly needs to be visited, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant municipality has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library was needed!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of daredevil bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around in amazement and shrugging its shoulders, the cheeky Maas stacked his exquisite souvenirs into a pyramid in size and ended his actionistically underpinned speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So this is my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has been filled up.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project has also been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small-town retort, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned, ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, is enriched by a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: book Eldorado under cheese dome.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasure of space and reading opens up when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the fired brick floor and the elegant street lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park benches, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves are along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and turned the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: In the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and building services center.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes parapets, sometimes staircase railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard.
And so one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Friesland farm.
For many years, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - into four-centimetre-thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-meter-long hike, you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heating and cooling is done with geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass lintel, the sun shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wood beams, which stand transversely to the glass façade, serve as shading and absorb a large part of the solar radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
For the time being, this is intended to fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully stocked - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled to the brim.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for adornment.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in achieving the supreme discipline known in technical jargon as identity creation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
DW: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes that's true.
This is because it is currently changing its foreign policy away from a policy that was managed, so to speak, by the US, towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans find themselves caught between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.
I think they are still approaching their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean in concrete terms from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions on national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude to the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to attach too much weight to it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great deal of understanding for the German position in Europe and even in the US.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even earn a certain respect.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly spoken out in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I think that the Obama administration secretly understands the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, if only because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to take the lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings are released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be receptive to different neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, as is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it hides a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will be right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney at Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in IP infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively fakes.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he is taking action against Chinese companies officially obtaining the right from the trademark office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This refers to women who catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is damaging to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and litigation costs of the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and cost money.
The proceedings can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because after the long duration the disputed name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he infringed his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient staff and space resources.
In the past year, however, one had returned from the "emergency situation in the workflow to normality".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still waiting to be settled in the office.
Tackling this costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China leads the list of new registrations around the world for the tenth time in a row, the authority said.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Put simply, this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Tackling this costs many times over, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to achieve that his illegal production of imitation motor vehicle parts was dismantled.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich, says that they themselves failed to do so because family names cannot be protected in Germany.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munich.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be extremely careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive even had to look through one-hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle in vain.
"This shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spill back into Europe.
Namely, when imitators secure unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
The Group has long since given up this business area, but was nevertheless able to avert registration.
"You have to be extremely careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but foreigners should "register everything that is somehow worth protecting in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is defeated in the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the other side royalties for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the pounding: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - press, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his smooth, wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
About fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from human geneticists to househusbands.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choral part has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping people to help themselves
Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that there are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
Of these, 23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found sponsors for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
Nobody can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but he can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally bringing them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
Esitjeni shows on a small scale what ails the whole of Swaziland: highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, you certainly have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to enable him to have a warm meal a day.
But just one year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been taking care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally ever since.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs include HIV, human pappilomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydial infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human pappilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: Around 20 percent of new HIV infections are attributable to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human pappilomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer one hundred percent protection.
In some cases, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
If diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairwoman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms arrive on time for school every day.
If you don't have anyone left, you come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association just like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized that many in the village had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, people prefer to keep silent about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together through southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also wrested a few tears from many grim border guards.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light" say the people there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shaded region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life got to other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earthlings, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small peepholes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition of terms in 2006.
This image section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, harder to identify are the pink "newborns" in the Star Circle Hall.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been recorded by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come into their own.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a terrestrial continent earned this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they were formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remnants of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the Hubble Telescope's largest and sharpest images: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-split), as dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of the star's birthplace into three.
In the constellation Serpent Bearer, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can call them by their nickname Southern Wheel of Fire.
The photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1400 light years away, consists of dust grains ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was stitched together from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy scientists call UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Starry Cradle is always producing new youngsters.
This star cloud, combined with the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, no dust exists yet, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for stargazing.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become larger and larger - and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, pictured here, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light-collecting power.
Despite the comparatively small mirror diameter, this comes close to that of the world's largest reflecting telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at ESO's Chilean observatory.
Its primary mirror is to cover a whopping 42 meters - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures are not expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it can be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The image documents the final launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have suggested for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and live to be 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A search for clues in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There's even a museum of longevity.
A search for clues in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that they perfectly speak Persian as well as Azeri and are very long-lived.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts overly massive architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival – and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Fathered a child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who lived to be 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate his age by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the very elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also a striking number of very old people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia live extremely many very old men."
Due to a lack of documents, however, no scientific proof of age could be provided, especially since civil status registers were missing.
Butter melted every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why do so many very old people live here in the south?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is due to nutrition.
But the fact that the high-calorie diet of the Talyschen, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, should be so healthy, does not seem exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik.
With its 97 years, it is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter churn, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both long since grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly lined up, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so I never ran out of it and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She only ever ate what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my whole life, I have never once bought groceries in the supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's elderly.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) per month as a pension, an amount on which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graying son is right: "The elderly are highly respected in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing from the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country's deep divisions.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president was not sparing with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had, Mohamed Morsi said almost apologetically, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are sure, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
In fact, the 234 articles that were pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nightly, 15-hour par force ride are sometimes worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judiciary is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least that's what a newly added article suggests: In all matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great appeal throughout Sunni Islam, must be consulted.
This does not have to happen, but it can mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: civilian military jurisdiction is to be maintained.
These courts were used to suppress opponents during Mubarak's rule.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were imprisoned in military custody.
The state should also, according to the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
This is so vaguely formulated legally that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Incidentally, no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
In return, another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what constitutes an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the formulation that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar enough?
A matter of interpretation, like so much in the draft submitted to Morsi for signature and, in his words, will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square, vowing to bring down the Charter before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei declared that the draft constitution belonged "on the garbage mountain of history".
Via short message service Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition activist Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, held a counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Cleanse the country!" and asserted: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably have provoked civil war-like conditions.
Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered certain.
"The word human rights does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when it was imprisoned or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto suspending it," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which views the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take its revenge.
A demonstrator on Tahrir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country's secret to success have something to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
That's how you have to imagine the nasal smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, spectacular scenery – and that persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to go away.
Rakfisk is salt-sprinkled trout that - depending on how smelly you want your fish to be - is fermented in water for up to a year.
In Norway, when darkness falls over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to, well, really captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk general".
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I taste some appetizers.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to your nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has had quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the depths of winter, after a long fermentation, it was taken out and consumed, no doubt with the help of alcohol-dampened senses.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival that not so long ago was far richer than Norway, immigrants are pouring in.
Rakfisk is seen as something important – an essential, if strong-smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
They still hate to name Anders Breivik - the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, Norway's wealth today has been largely due to the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays of ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Their English, like most people here, is impeccable.
We are not very boastful, we do not like bragging.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's returns are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone threw money around they didn't have, Norway kept its wallet tightly locked.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rakfisk," she adds with a lighthearted laugh.
I'm standing in the snow lining up for another dish - I've had enough of rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat tastes good to me.
But in the evening the smelly fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a bow-tie-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
People clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico's president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, blocking off several major traffic routes to the capital and wreaking havoc on the streets.
However, the goal was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential armband and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has performed well economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy to help us achieve this goal.
Before he was on an equal footing with the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built, which are a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
Especially in terms of security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway overpasses and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to combat drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a patch of wasteland near a large landfill.
During the administration of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Pena Nieto's critics believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of femicide during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights back tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and rigor mortis had already set in.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But exactly this, according to the family, has been denied her until now.
The authorities treated me as if I was a gossiper, troublemaker, complainer.
They want people to simply accept their judgment and keep their mouths shut.
"But that's not possible when there were so many formal errors and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential armband on Saturday, he will also be assuming a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to pay special attention to this issue during his tenure.
"I hope as president he is what he was as governor," says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But this is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors allege: Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse
Prosecutors deny Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to dismiss the charges due to excessively harsh prison conditions
The private of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
Prosecutors on Friday sought to establish that Army Private Bradley Manning — charged with the largest disclosure of classified information in U.S. history — missed several opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he allegedly suffered while in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month term in Quantico, Virginia showed no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request by the defense to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison term - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been held under increased conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as "very professional" overall.
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints of abuse, though officers had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officers had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them. However, they were not recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) 'No problems,' and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to "injury prevention."
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status — which is one step below suicidal prom — to protect him and others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was okay and get rid of the observation status for injury prevention (...) to achieve what I consider to be a higher quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once fell unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrank on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about an allegation he had made in his testimony on Thursday - for example, he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico for one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself in his blanket during this count.
When questioned on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket with which he could have covered himself. He admitted, however, that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning told the officer he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his experiences in prison and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges deemed too extreme will be appealed.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations that apply to all detainees held under the highest security at Quantico.
Charges against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, unlawfully publishing intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If found guilty of all charges, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants — they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at passport control when perplexity spread through me.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to hold my own in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and stood in line for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trafficking.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never give it a single thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership at gunpoint to cede more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints -- in the Mexican press and among the country's elites -- about how Americans are harassing their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma embark on the warpath.
And yet, in reality, Mexico's greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person — perhaps a parent or grandparent — wasn't given a chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases, this person matched a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now have been living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living – not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but when it comes to our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and look down on us for not being Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are — and Mexican Americans resent them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel they don't belong to one country or the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you are not rooted in either of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I was supposed to learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and sections of the educated middle class want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to appoint Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" to Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to strengthen its ties with Mexico.
Now.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual finger-pointing, countless buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed -- and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have hit near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate may finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened die-hards on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are crammed into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah holds power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt – by far the most populous and important Arab country – on Israel's southern flank has permanently altered the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is in-law with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proven itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains steadfast in its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, thanks in no small part to the barriers that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared contrary to international law, but are constantly being expanded.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why coddle these deceitful Palestinians and give them their own state?
If they were indeed in control of the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their allies in Gaza?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to prevail. But the Arab Spring could thwart their plans.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little sympathy for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties at home.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower is unlikely to help the new Arab governments repair their economies.
That pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign -- and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis, too, should think more long-term.
As the rest of the Arab world takes tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder keg that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and as the Arab population grows, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in Gaza will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an external impetus
The correct answer is the one advocated by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states where Israel cedes territory for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, along with Turkey and Qatar, must now halt arms shipments to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial swaps and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must do his part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems that he is equally averse to involvement.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted prospect.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on plain green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with graphic images showing sick body parts and infants and children sick from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, from next Saturday the only difference will be between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font.
Australia is thus introducing the world's strictest regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government assumes studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at the age of 26 are 99% likely not to start afterwards.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to advertise with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar moves.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would encourage black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws in Australia's Supreme Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stock.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch lies in the popularity of social media with the very demographic targeted by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV commercials, banned them from acting as sports sponsors and forced most retailers to stop displaying cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no control over international sites.
"If you market tobacco and only have a small area left to advertise your products, you can't avoid the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media outlets like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in brand testimonials written by "ordinary people."
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that he even records a video for them - or does a marketing agency have anything to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries engage in major trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to impose photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not influence me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a butt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette pack with a photo of an oral tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco store King of the Pack in Sydney's city centre, says uniform packaging has made it difficult to replenish his shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort in a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we'll shut down," he adds, visibly angry.
In an ever-electrified world, it's nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane broke down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying – even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
If it's up to them, it's okay for us — and our kids — to get bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us these days are almost constantly staring at one screen or another, we no longer reap the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing free time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii's house are decorated with Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do so."
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention German," which appeared in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at a low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who listened to the barely audible television reported feeling more boredom than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
If, on the other hand, you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "such as searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can be distracting and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and doodling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hang around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boredom susceptibility scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale are statements such as "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get boring more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida — especially when it comes to the need for more and greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tired bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they weren't in school.
However, only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, that he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily routines.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and succumb to gambling or drugs to alleviate them – studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do.
When you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll be happy.
But television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, but these evaporate again in the long term.
So if you hand your bored child an iPad, you can dissuade him from boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to entertain, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant sprinkling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the agonizing, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it's hard to keep busy once the noise has stopped."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player, is on trial in southeastern Colorado for an offense that will soon be legal in that state: possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia — trivial offenses, each with a $100 fine — and given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of marijuana-related misdemeanors are already being dropped here and in Washington state, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for small-scale possession. This will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative counties have vowed to pursue existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to block new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads helplessly.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013 in mind.
Washington believes that Colorado is definitely ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation. There, the drug was legalized first for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Spirits Commission in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, marking the end of a gray area where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified during this time - such as how the state requirement of "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana should be reconciled with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses against people over the age of 21, and that police would not seek criminal charges for these offenses "as of now."
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce city regulations regulating medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to persuade users to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people face trial for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offenses at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters opposed the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer report adults for possession of smaller amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that reconciling personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system would not be easy.
And the conflicting reactions across the state revealed a profound dichotomy among local officials about the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents defendants on trial for marijuana offenses and serves locally as a spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for this that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being touted as national model cases for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials prepare for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the federal government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offense at the federal level.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed medical marijuana sales in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while detectives are unlikely to kick down doors to seize smaller quantities of the drugs, they are likely to resist tolerating the legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoria on new marijuana businesses, although they may not open for about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban that is expected to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our municipality voted against this change in the law.
We are guided by what the church has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions remain unanswered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only today's university students are attacked for their views
It had always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended what I once considered the largest temple of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of moving into Worscester College in the late eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and caused the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the next room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously declared that I left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been bullied for only one reason - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I had been a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate right students is suffering similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now reached such proportions that a group of them last week called for equal equality protections that benefit gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They are demanding a place on their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent BBC Two documentary about political students, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and flaunted a silver-colored suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as "scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the University of Nottingham's Conservative Students' Association, told a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has seen growing opposition to moderate right students among JCR members.
"This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
Hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher – a former student – due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have startled even Stalinists.
In the first days of the freshman week, where new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what will happen to come.
My experience was that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even happily participated in it.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatisation and the government's rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I was asked to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face made of cake batter, and quite spiteful.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
Tears welled up in my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few French lessons in your free time, so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to pretend.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on everything.
This trick was to prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically attended Eton College, which was considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I only be able to meet like-minded people after dark?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead stretched into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation in my mind's eye.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-minded, and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more outgoing friends and family in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in his forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said meekly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly melted with shame, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me and called them "old fools."
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my captors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You are welcome to call me a whiny floppy tail.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragically is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years were assembled.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on display until 3 March, there are a large number of private letters and photos signed by the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England and Lord Snowdon.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from humble fashion designer in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick out their butts on your gorgeous carpet, like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His influence could be seen and felt in every detail of his home, the decoration, the food and the music.
"All the invitees felt important and loved," recalls the "top model", who began her career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but rather of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre-long catwalk that proposes a role reversal: the user takes the model's place and walks down the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristóteles Onassis,  the costumes worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte" or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norwegen, Rosario von Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion leader Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care, because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory-colored silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years marred with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as each of his clients' husbands.
"I've always noticed his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the wearers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to climb down to the floor of its crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle pace, keeping their balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys, and walk three kilometers with the tiring heavy baskets to the scales, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the deposits in the volcano and (never better) its workers since 1960, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
She then sells this to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who usually makes three distances a day.
For each distance he needs three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an almost inhumane effort, however, is three times what he would earn from fieldwork.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid a day during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java,  to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
For the past three years, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left its first mark on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a donkey.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also emanates at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters load the baskets of sulfur onto their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that the guardians of this nature park demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human donkeys, along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros).
"This work is for the animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stocky, 42-year-old porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains of serious illnesses ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks along a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, at the age of 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the poverty continues generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human workhorses at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame not having children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and parenting.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems implausible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song that echoes local sayings such as "Pushing a bao" (loaf) into the oven to poke fun at Singapore's low birth rate.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, hopes that the commercial will succeed in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their "national duty."
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was an issue we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (quick flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like composing a rap?
1,2 Children
The one who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But so far everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 – also known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a lot more options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to getting married and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social realities have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and the delay in marriage and birth, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely concealed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and failing to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore last year achieved its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Department of Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they will discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger housing units.
They're so popular, and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
As a result, they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously faced with obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district suggest that they won't have much impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is postponed by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It's important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and cost of owning and raising as reasons for not being able to have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there is so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to when he makes known situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who frequently use the Internet.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very unique" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in one post," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also pass my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me or someone doing the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nudes, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged into Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives far away or with friends," he says.
When asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask. In Ask, he admits he doesn't know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone pushes me or demands them from me, I just remove them from my account," he admits.
José reached out to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He only did it privately."
He then explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if I don't like him or I want to wipe one out of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for searching for information; but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in education at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants," coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them when we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be disseminated, published or said, at an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky when the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. So why are you doing it on the internet?
Or: Would you like it if someone published a photo of you, like the one you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission beforehand if you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone off the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they will have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "Thou shalt not talk to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced in advance and theoretically should be signed by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Session of Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially said they would hand it over after the retreat, but said afterwards that it would be published on the Peruvian government's website at some point.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulated among the journalists was obtained from the press officers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets demanding more information.
After that, the presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala Declaration and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab States Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, too, despite strong press requests, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced in advance, was not published either.
On the official website of the ASPA you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems were in place for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a ruling by the Hague Court settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague, to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial launched by Lima against Santiago.
"We will follow and carry out the verdict on the differences we are currently bringing to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, shaking hands with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a grave mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the rulings of this International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 following the ouster of its president, Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions had been taken and the lines of action had been set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
Commenting on the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our productive output and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new forms of economy," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects would be five Peruvian ones, located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its readmission into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday to treat the maritime conflict respectfully, following an ICJ ruling questioned by Bogotá.
"Maybe tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these avenues - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers also met ahead of the summit to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the temporary chairmanship of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from the integration of its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, whereby "South America can indeed learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the member states of Unasur promote.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those that have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were "reasonable suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his procedure would not be followed."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this by means of a videoconference that could have been carried out via the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be affected.
"Since he is in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there was a risk that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a confined space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at Ecuador's embassy in London was to grant him carte blanche to travel to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of cases at various European instances," he said.
And "if Britain grants this carte blanche tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogates Mr. Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish jurisprudence allows and has been done in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, evil intent and lies that invalidate freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "nor by the bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries," anticipating that if re-elected, he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain tough and not allow opportunism or a coup d'état disguised as legal" because it "has destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries to be "absolutely justified".
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
Referring to the possibility of running as a candidate for Ecuador's next presidential election to win his third consecutive mandate, he said he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 elections, he would retire from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in circumstances as unjust as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to live up to that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, after which I will retire from public life.
This is true even if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that he was expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean in any case a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader attended today in Lima the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of dying due to AIDS today is too late
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor "tried to mitigate" without apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about it; and this with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came in 1994 after several fights.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmas.
At that time, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know about their illness and for whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious disease and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of people's immune systems at the start of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs have greater chances:  up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that anyone who is diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25 "can easily live to be 75 years old as long as they are under control," this professional explained.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA's annual report), it is still true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year there had already been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that people come into a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a concomitant infection. In order to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all individuals who need to do so."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it was made by a friend of his, who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor).  which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then better burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were handed out individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people at risk for new infections include young people.
"Why do you need them?" is a common mockery of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, which young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the counter, but in dispensers in public toilets of facilities that are frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity is not to be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is set for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that Mexican laws allow do not apply in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District in Texas leaves Mexican companies helplessly exposed to the confiscation of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door for Mexico's largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the United States Supreme Court over three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, initially says that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the debts in the bankruptcy estate which Vitro's branches had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Bankruptcies).
It is also true that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, Vitro's creditors, the creditors who brought proceedings against Vitro in the courts of the United States, namely the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which dealt blows to the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal so that the vote takes place in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not upheld, the Cerciorare appeal will be lodged, which calls for a review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Bankruptcies, indicating that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries.  to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down in cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equal treatment between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After several months of stalls in the complaints filed by Mexico's air transport unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Air Pilot Trade Union Federation) has finally made progress.
The petition, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from Bank IXE's trustee account F/589 in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to acquire shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a University of the Caribbean forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the land beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industries) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental institution, which destroyed partially protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government did not comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had disconsidered the possibility because it considered it a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, construction company Homex is launching stock exchange certificates worth over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical issuances that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Formed by the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was associated with basketry for more than 60 years and has travelled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, agent and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"All my life I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the federation in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he met with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.  dwells.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-managing director or managing director of the club.
"Those were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the pleasure of being part of eight championships of vaqueros since 1967, be it as managing director, co-managing director or coach.
These were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, took over," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made one championship possible for Bayamon, Gausse would make for another.
The championship of vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because in 1988 he was already at the top of the association.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we beat the USA at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze if it hadn't been for that Canadian referee who let us repeat the last play for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as is the one who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Championships.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were back in that team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
One team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all forecasts.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill very much.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What is left for you to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalizing the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren, and going to a basketball game every now and then.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of '80s' greed, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were in Dallas with him for Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving, and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Charming Jeannie" of the television company NBC.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "djinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He has also starred in two short-lived comedies, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinematic work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
CBS's dramatic series about the Ewing clan and other characters around it aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot at J.R.?", which was intended to create anticipation for an episode full of emotions, where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in betting houses.
Thus, the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer became known in one chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, who turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave town. But others also had reasons for wanting him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) admitted.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should read "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of devotees in the world and remains in our hearts for those who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was being filmed, the channel informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT on how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who performed classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she met Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stages in New York at the beginning of the 50s, after which he served from 1952 to 1956 in the air force in England.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could harm anyone or affect them in any way," he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and after," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course studying the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fish hook: the end of the "long backward count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have dubbed "Deudarmaggedon," and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse is beginning.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, that would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios that lead to a particular human behavior are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
"I tried to educate students about what's possible, probable, credible, and impossible," Wacker said.
On the University of Pennsylvania's main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course simply titled "The End of the World."
"We're not recording 2012 so we always have the option to be able to hold the course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent doom", students have to study, create projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no choice but to "keep working until the night when the world supposedly ends," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no places left in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled up with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Rutgers-Camden student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, says he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a class where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed — and less a professor — said they believed in the last date of Dec. 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we're discrediting it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key item on the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries, when people responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"Elsewhere, people don't think that way," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, is quick to answer the question of whether he would know of a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not participating at the end of the world," he wrote, alluding to an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years there have been many days of last judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
