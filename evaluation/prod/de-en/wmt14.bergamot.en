Schools are encouraged to be more focused on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students must in future at least one play of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century. The century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
"Unworthy texts" are also included in the exam to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take a standalone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core courses will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grade system and less coursework.
In a summer speech, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs become "challenging, more ambitious and strict."
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math examination – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from real life," including financial mathematics.
Rape in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty early after the crime.
The act had caused horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the victim's survival for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrible that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
During the trial, Kana had admitted to be in a bar with Booysen on night.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not enough.
The public prosecutor's office also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that at the time of the attack Kana was alone.
Rapes are almost part of everyday life in South Africa: every year there are some 64 000 complaints about sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
The police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of unreported violence in sexual violence, but is 10 to 25 times.
In a small town of New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable chewing owl because he has set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt is not dissuaded from his dream.

The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in suspense.
Trading at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a notice, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The most recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indices of the Nasdaq were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there were two mishaps in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank had sent Goldman Sachs massively incorrect purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trading in the US came to a standstill for several hours due to a computer bounce on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The IPO of Facebook also caused a sensation last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not coped with the flood of buying and sell orders, later the SEC found and thundered the company to a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Secret service retinue Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know how to clarify his
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the USA in an unaddressed letter, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor General.
The letter reads as follows, after a translation disseminated by Ströbele:
To the persons responsible
I was asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was formerly contrary or old. employed by direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed the systematic violations of the law of my government, which led me out of moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and continuing agitation that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation grants me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, including senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a public service.
These espionage revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly hidden misuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat Dissen's breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise political expression and be charged.
Nevertheless, pronouncing the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental stance.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and in accordance with the law in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, especially with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country once the situation has been resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Playing Caravans with Machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they first await the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El Pais" on Thursday.
They then played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who took her away was to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
However, when the girl described the tather course before the police without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The elder cited a rivalry in the football match as the reason.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Jerusalem government does not confirm attack on Syrian airbase
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous on Thursday claimed to the American news channel CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an airbase in Syrian Latakia the day before.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" which the Israeli government had feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot at by the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and held the Israelis responsible for it.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite sites of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Newa defensive missiles and a battery of SA-3 rockets were shown, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency also quotes an anonymous Israeli official by saying that he believed that Israel had carried out the attack, but is not safe.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, "We don't comment on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had been trying to supply ground-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that a military response would follow.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle Brings Free Medical Aid to Remote Villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father repeatedly losing consciousness and traveling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed, which spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there, which was to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet it is not first.
There are many patients.
Some people die even because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organisation.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for her, most Cameroonians would not be able to afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered allowed to see in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze in minibuses and travel with the tied medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
It is not always everything that goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, song and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebrating and barrel – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – likes to be present at the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a range of areas.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so bshaft and its volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It is a tiring workload, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum the whole night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations last year and knows that with her work it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a hernia he had received now enabled him to work again.
"That changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and volunteers in Bwelle's group.
He is always either in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgeries where we help to dab blood or the instruments for Dr. Hold Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical materials.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is without a doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
To help others to live a happier life and thus fulfill a promise that he has made to his father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be held on the 22nd of May New cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the one who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this is due to a group of 120 "cardinals entitled to vote".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to be held on the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals entitled to vote will probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope usually requires as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote again amounted to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory of next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, said Valero.
There is currently a certain excess on the part of Europe, and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding opportunities for reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals who are supposed to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "good possible" that Francis asks the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this position so far – that's all completely new.
Valero said that the bishops from large towns are typically called to cardinals, but there are "full surprises - so we don't know who he appoints".
Workers rushed by Leiter: seriously injured
When a defective outside feeler changed, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to change a defective heating feeler on the exterior facade of an inn.
As he climbed the ladder based on the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who want to ensure prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives who roughly mapped the UK company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now exported outside Europe and are concentrated in countries that modernise and grow, while the states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government side to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of being in the long and strenuous process of reforming the reaches of EU institutions.
In her view, they believe that the majority of business leaders believe should be brought back to Westminster, control of these key competences, from antitrust law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, because, according to companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to those who traditionally are most pro-European.
Finally, and probably says most, our consultation of business leaders found that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards changes in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This insight, which is reflected in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the booklet of action back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, as the eurozone now moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the outcome of our survey shows what focuses on trade for companies and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules.

Learning instead of being unemployed: pilot project for unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is now starting at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 men and women who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to become skilled workers for hotels and restaurants.
"What is new about is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency.
The benefits are manifold: The participants would not become unemployed, the companies would be given trained specialists who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency does not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Catering Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.

GM calls new pickup trucks in the US to repair seat backrest
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks built in 2014 to remedy a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement from the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for headrests.
"If the vehicle is hit from the back, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message was read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recalled models were made between the 1st. August and 10 August September made.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
Due to the 16-day Government Shutdown, the NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM share rose by 1.4 percent to USD 37.47 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mother buried in the forest and retirement
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to receive their pension and care fee.
In order to be able to continue to receive pensions and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg resident buried his dead mother in the forest after investigations by the police.
At first he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he had cast the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesperson said on Friday.
According to this, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time it was noticeable that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained them.
The 67-year-old had finally granted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy gave no indications of a capital crime.

Kenyan press outraged about controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask oneself: what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was to be read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law not to be precise.
"The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President is listening to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government is "taking the media effectively into a stranglehold" through the new law. The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow," and entitled the draft as "Dorconious."
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published shots of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robed the luxurious shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to interrogating the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the summons were withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single sentence can push most radio stations into bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on those of their description after the "living blogosphere" of Kenya.
If they keep the media silent, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a decisive factor of control in public life.
"You leave politicians to themselves, lead the country to bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and gatherers," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already attracted public anger in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinsted their hearty salaries of approximately 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festive Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
The return of the first documentary mention is approaching and getting closer.
When the year comes to an end in just over eight weeks, the anniversary year is on the agenda.

But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The fool guild Strohglonki begins on 8. February with a night of tradition on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has on 29. March the banquet and then celebrates from 1 to 4th May the district music festival.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10. May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates it as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7. July.
The city of Geisingen was founded in a deed of gift, owned by the monastery of St. Gallen is first mentioned in a document in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which was then a place of jurist.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is 40 years ago.
Also this year will be held in the parish church of St. St. Marien celebrates a Hubertus fair on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was a very ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liege.
The hunting horn blower group of Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth performs old, originally French melodies on par force horns (nurs of natural horns in the mood of E) after old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog crowds on hunting musically.
The ceremonial fair will take place on Sunday, 3. November, at 11.30 am.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law, which is closely linked to Barack Obama, is constitutionally constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces American citizens to take out health insurance or to pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the state's tax authority.
The chief judge of John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held the view that the Health Act requires states to either extend the admission requirements for Medicaid or otherwise removed all state Medicaid grants was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuits were brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger, Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
The happiness of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels succeed to reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfe Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the club's tenth birthday was celebrated, which has already shown considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne conducted numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the speeches, pictures of the inserts were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border body vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had suggested that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic system and now plans to work at the association in an advisory function, according to Henne.
In 2008, in the record time of almost a week, the Schleeh carpentry from Baiersbron created the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity hospital in Nagold is to become a wegrationalized.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, such as hen, such as deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to visit various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, dressing material, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour, by telling a Mercedes vehicle converted from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and described the experiences of the regular musicians, who traditionally support the club, on their Mauritania journey.
He cited his work in the audit area as a young MP as his personal reasons.
When he realized how much money was lost, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global popularity.
It should by no means be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as a front demarcation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is standing before the renovation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is to be once again put on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, a small angle wall was installed, for stabilisation and static relief of the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further procedure includes, says Alexander Misok from the Bräunlingen city planning office, including the state monument office in the planning and creating a renovation concept for the old wall.
Accordingly, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which will then be placed on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school interior within the two side wings of the school, which was built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of being refurbished from the ground up and placed on a new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has an arch tilt forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard use by students, which has been done through the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard refurbishment was even planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a postponement.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which was even used for filming, will be the state monument office.
If specifications come from this site, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the memorial conservationists.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now taught again in a well-refunded old school building with new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person has fired shots on Fridayleading (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management told Twitter via the short message service that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several injured.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said they saw a shooter with a gun in one of the departure rooms, as several media reported.
One traveler told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travellers had shouted and children cried.
Among those waiting, panic had broken out, many hid behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security office suffered a gunshot wound on the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
After that, he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport-building evacuated
Television images showed how numerous ambulances and police cars were presented in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were brought to safety from the building.
Users published on Twitter photos of a special task command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management reported via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed long backs.
With the exception of landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it was said.
However, several flyers were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the USA.
Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 footpaths in Gutach were put into operation at the village park - within sight of the older town hall lights.
Two installations so close together: intention or shield cooker?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall light was installed at that time because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light safe both cyclists and bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially opened yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area 'Grub'.
"In the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light had to be created for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg district office.
"According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 every day, about ten percent of which are heavy goods," Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is simply going first here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but was rejected because of the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested when selecting the site of the traffic light masts: "Use of a van loaded especially for us with particularly long logs, we tested whether these vehicles could reach the B 33 from the Sulzbach path without having to bend the traffic light masts."
The approximately 15,000 euros of traffic light installation itself is "the most modern thing that is currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so strongly that the lights from the drivers, for example, are clearly visible even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or people with reduced mobility go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will surely come across the road," explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver had to think along here as a partner and observe the roadway.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, a luxury-class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was the focus of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the agenda, each playing against everyone.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, and was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were identical to Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams from SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award course, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the challenge cold to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze podium was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the tournament was successfully concluded.
Frosted bird rescued by air rescue service from the North Sea drill island
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drill island, was released back into nature.
The water rail was flown to Aberdeen by helicopter last month, where it was nursed by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, who was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the rig.
He added, "He couldn't continue flying, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When the water rail was released, the water rail was fit and healthy again.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was completely equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operations, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 x 90 centimetre measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it, the authorities explained.
The discovery of the tunnel has ensured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court records.
Three men who worked as drivers according to the authorities were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and lifelong in the event of a guilty verdict.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel with the challenge of how to quickly get their product to users.
In 2010, authorities found an almost 640-metre-long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "sufficiency test"
The government is considering extended measures about a "sufficiency test" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is introduced, it would be used by a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to occupy unqualified workplaces or as a back door for the moving of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be regarded as an insult by Australia's neighbors.
"Sustaining explanations such as 'foreigners should come to the back" and 'Australia' first are a very unpleasant relapse into times when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for the discussion outlines twelve measures once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "reputational criterion" is adopted, then someone who applies for a visa could be checked to see whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeking probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been looked after by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian place lights with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their gloomy valley.
Due to the low degree of sunrise, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at an altitude of 45 metres, a dream of the year came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", enthusiastic mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the starting ceremony on TV2.
Some valley residents clinched sun loungers, others put on sunglasses for safety.
So far, sun-seekers had to travel to a nearby summit in winter with a cable car.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally said goodbye to the 5 million crowns (around 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been giving the Italian Alpine town Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the topics of home affairs and justice.
The responsible working group was meeting in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, the bribes of parliament and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration working group also wanted to continue its consultations.
This should be included, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to decide on one - the Union rejects a double pass.
When it comes to transport, which is not based on the conference regulations this Friday, the SPD underpinned its no to a passenger car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for the frequent swing and thus ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for the topic of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his faction.
There were noverted traffic on country roads, which are already focusing on accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be only a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Shrill beeping bothersome disintegrates local residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the stockpile.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
The coal shimmers black on the campsite in front of the dike.
Two huge blue stockpile and return loading devices or load the coal as required.
With every movement of the handling devices, a shrill warning sound sounds over the terrain.
"The signals are safety and required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
With a storm in unfortunate winds, this can be heard widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city's order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to rely on open dialogue with its neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to go before the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on the coal import for power plants and is one of the big players in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the carrycot in front of the terminal, which is recessed at 18.5 metres, even capesize bulk carriers can have been handled here.
"This year, we want to crack the 3-million-ton mark for the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants inland.
When the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal import are realistic per year.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The local council agreed to sell in the non-public part of its recent meeting.
The building changed its owner to a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," stresses Maier.
The budget estimated EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
It is right for the mayor to have handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, to heat up, to look for the garden and to clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Halloween 2013: in figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I will probably not do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween are the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, provocative inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer need to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk spaces will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes for their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of "hot dogs".
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not squeamish.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars on this year, said The Nielsen Company.
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, sweets and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who move through the quarters with the saying "sweet or sour" according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's not eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold at Halloween, says the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
This is about nine billion grains of maize.
It is a puzzle I have not been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate 500 million dollars in revenues, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you pee in the pants and then put the friends on Facebook where you won't get them going again, and then the guy you stand on leave a comment like "netter facial expression".
But we finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the carving of a pumpkin vanne is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from an early age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, is believed to come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Punchers must go to prison
Due to exploitative human trafficking, punching, threatening, insulting and dangerous assault, the District Court of Konstanz has a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process consultation.
According to this, he met women via internet or telephone contacts in five cases, which he sent on the line against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the revenues of the women, some of whom were acquiring for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he provided contacts between women and the outside world.
Together with a colleague who told the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant first claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion alongside him.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus of a limited ability to blame, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the damaged women.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified by telephone surveillance measures after an initial display.
The interference in conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women all over his body had discovered bird spots, has not made any statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality" who consider violence and exploitation in this profession to be normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He had come loose from these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after his imprisonment," he said.
Tripodi denied to have been influenced by Obeid
An investigation by the state corruption supervision is being initiated against the former Minister of Labor Party, Joe Tripodi, from New South Wales.
The former NSW minister denies that the provisions on Maritim lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden participation in three properties in state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering after its expiry in August 2005.
Now it is being determined because of the accusation that Tripodi had known from obey's hide-out interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy staff figure Lynne Ashpole said on Thursday.
In many years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned the obeids every year 2.5 million dollars, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was the Porter Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke out in favour of public tenders.
But he violated having made the changes at the request of hide, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reorganisation of the government's leases.
A telephone note submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had switched to the Sanctuary ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the preparation of the commercial leases," asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," answered Tripodi.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
NSA revelations reinforce company paranoia for state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BAT), the German internal intelligence service, he was to photograph the umbrella of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to the German media, the BAT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the USA and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US did not use possibilities for foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit."
But since Edward Snowden, the former employee who became a whistleblower, began publishing his cornucopia at US surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at their stake.
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought up the company's paranoia to a new high because of state surveillance.
The clamp overflowed the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been busy, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management will certainly be potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now an almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published by the consulting firm EY in July.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the USA has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce their dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
We were suggested in the Bundestag that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"That doesn't work," says Hasso Plattner, Chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If a strong European IT industry had been wanted, they should not have been let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical sophistication have shocked the US espionage authorities discovered by the Snowden discoveries companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
There is a major change in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the USA is subject to the jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after revealing the US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP's deputy managing director, says: “We see a new question from customers that did not exist a year ago – it is: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this legal area?”
Many German company managers take the view that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and these therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place.
That has always been the case.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The corporate management does not normally boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been imprisoned that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or allowing a laptop to lie in the hotel room is not advisable to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of automotive manufacturer Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting, so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they go on trips abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are the global market leader in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are often lacking experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access," warns the BAT in a report.
The USA warn its own companies against other countries espionage.
According to Washington Post, France, Russia and Israel ranked second among China in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, and Israel ranked second among China.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to industrial espionage, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French  Intelligence Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence agencies are very well aware that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spying on their allies."
When the horse show experts found themselves in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they knew that there was a hard competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The baby, who is not even in kindergarten and took his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland pony trotted easily through the three rounds and won the first prize – whereby they left 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which lie far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and had been practicing every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went off the square with a gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howell said, "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered him on and slapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As it started, it won't be long before he is on the "Horst of the Year" show – and I'm sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual Pferdeschau said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they would have beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed her part, which was really a perfect cause.
Care Day at the small English hut
On the occasion of the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut open on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers called this area the highlight of the gorge slope, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the nursing day was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature.
At the same time as the touristic aspect, the ecological could also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Regional Council following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of farsightedness coincides with the aim of preserving the now strongly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life Project and the previous days of care for the future.
After these various remarks, head of the territory Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up, the forest tractor may be ready for call.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the unobstructed view at the viewpoint.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then to a snack.
In the past, the older citizens were hosted in the service area.
Meanwhile this afternoon is found in the nursing home St. Joseph held.
The residents of the home looked forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were in charge of conventional melodies.
Königsfeld: Small team beats himself bravely
The volunteer fire brigade mastered their autumn main sample with flying colours despite a shortage of staff.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
In his training acceptance, department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße.
There a short circuit is said to have been created when sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two respiratory body-bearers of the weir were ready to enter the building after the first inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them outside.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was provided via an overground hydrants at a distance of about 100 metres.
Now three extinguishing attacks have been designed.
A hollow blasting tube was also used in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer was also concerned with showing what should be achieved with less available personnel.
In an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daily operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the exercise.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
One week before the next nuclear meeting, Iran is satisfied with the five UN veto powers and Germany with the negotiation process.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jahadd Sarrif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end.
€325 million Australian bailout for Tasmanian healthcare bailout
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the bailout of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian healthcare system to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars in election aid.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments due to cataracts, are to be eliminated residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an e-recording system for electronic health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinic staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state's public health system from the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral achievements will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “pavement solution.”
"We are in the current situation because the laboratory government has withdrawd 430 million dollars from the health system," he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government is eating nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth puts 300 million in and then pretending that these are news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
In protest against the planned Reichsteuer, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
An arbitration meeting will end without result.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France manoeuvred themselves into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President Francois Hollande received club and association representatives in Paris on Thursday at the Elysée Palace and their complaints also listened to.
However, he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the announced for the end of November will now be closed, the head of the professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The one between the 29th November and the 2nd Playgrounds in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 scheduled in December are thus lost.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house were "Sprich words from the Bible" and "Redewende from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairperson of the parish council, spoke in a lecture after breakfast on the biblical proverbs.
"Spoken words contain wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
It compared several proverbs with the relevant biblical passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: wooden eye is alert, how scales fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, there is the Lord in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker gave her listeners what the saying was.
The community councillor Christel Dehner took the idiom from the Middle Ages: all good things are three, blue, somewhat hearted.
She explained the significance and origin of the phrases she called "bridges into the past".
At the end, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were described in a humorous manner before they were handed over to the winners.
Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also included visitors to the breakfast round.
One could call it the Dostoevsky of the USA.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astoundingly the kinship in the outside: the piercing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And like Fjodor M. Dostoevsky with his massive oeuvre as a founder and apologist of the Russian soul is to be understood, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite something in his own country.
Some titles were published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans tape with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security mania and faith to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had hit drugs.
He has gotten, early on, that the computers are Divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His storys have inspired film leaders such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now especially significant.
The "minority report" dates from 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime", i.e. what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is shockingly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We grab them before they can commit a violence."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a penal camp full of teaspoon breakers." You read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into action.
Dick's narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the listening rush of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system turns through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Does not only accept errors and victims, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Reading Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Court blocks decision to stop and-frisk directive of the NYPD
A federal appeals court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("Anhalten und Browse") from the New York Police Department on Thursday, and alienated the judge from the case.
The 2. U.S. Court of Appeal said that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin were subjected to be suspended until an appeal of the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring unit to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the required suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be relieved of the case because she had violated the code of conduct for US judges, said that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled, police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-blowra program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot programme with body-bearing cameras in quarters where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a check by the police.
Oral proceedings to the appeal of the town shall be held after the 14th edition March 2014 scheduled.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights activists.
Controls of this kind have been around for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men who belonged to all minorities, which developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, and affect the way other police custodians use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force which is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not finish the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutionally constitutionful, but only reformed the way in which the NYPD is implemented.
Wrath about Judgment for Bombing of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who lost their lives in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily at the verdict for the last of the instigator who was put on trial, since they believed that Umar Patek was to be shot under civil law.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosive devices for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of sentence.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A guilty verdict was also set in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had called for life imprisonment, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomb builder, also called the "Demolition Man".
The decision has aroused painful memories in June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"One should put him in front of a firing command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with not having another grandson and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground as on the 12th century. Shortly after 11 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma after the attack for a month and "died" three times, while he was attached to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek earned the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should be given the death penalty before everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to let him go alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be tried.
He escaped the arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally picked up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda head Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had made that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't stand up," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown regrets how much suffering he has caused other people.
The verdict was sent before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
Showlobe said about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in his Russian asylum in the US scientific community around Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Office of the Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, reported the agency Interfax.
Previously, the Greens-Paspit member Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to met Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
Leg almost chopped off: Reissue of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and damage to property has begun before the Frankfurt District Court (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent at the beginning.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the bandidos back then.
The public prosecutor's office accuses them of engraving and hammering in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt on three men.
All the victims were seriously injured, and a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
The next year was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the accusation, it was about odd battles and a demonstration of force.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the verdict after the appeal of the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the district court for a new hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution because of another offence.
At the beginning, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night.
The at that time was then the investigating commissioner.
The focus was on mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been tapped by the police.
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law that they are iron - and not saying.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces have emerged since the last trial.
Eleven further days of negotiation are scheduled for the process.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blond curls and appears for the first time with a new head.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star who shocks his fans with a dramatic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated from her long blond curls in favor of a platinum blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look in Los Angeles on Wednesday and also posted a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It is the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the modest change.

The number of people without a job has fallen sharply in October by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the employment agency in Sonthofen.
Numerous companies have so far reacted in attitudes.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer: "We hardly have any specialists in the trade, in the healthcare sector and in the care of the elderly".
Seasons have been taking up job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry since September.
In mid-December the winter season begins there.

Traffic light in permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just does not turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do then - to drive on red?
If a person affected has been waiting long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to remain at least five minutes before the traffic light is to be assumed.
However, anyone who continues the journey despite red lights must be aware that he is in full debt for an accident caused by this.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic light was not broken, but jumped onto green shortly afterwards.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Losts of gains at Bombardier after decrease in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday, after coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contractual problems in the railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious schedule next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago has followed only three more take-offs so far, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned.
The results lagged below the forecasts and led to a fall in the price of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday in view of the fact that the stock has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures were largely expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft could catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries have been 177 moderate, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company's claims regarding the fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet airliner are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
Management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday, the programme was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than expected," said Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we have done.
This is done during the entire flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining ones shortly afterwards, it was stated by the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after their maiden flight, the first customer can put a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier said it reviewed the commissioning (EIS) planning and will update it in the next few months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of 30. In September, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars respectively. 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars respectively. 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, falling from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a gain of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was 30 year-round. September 32.9 billion dollars and was thus against the 31. December unchanged.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within the framework of our specifications, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division have increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport division was on 30. September 32.6 billion dollars and was thus against the 31st December slightly increased.
The profit margin in the area of transport was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, there will be new specifications for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, the Bombardier share fell by 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will switch to the Executive Board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly gains on Thursday.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones when take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read e-books, watch or play videos during critical flight phases, provided they are in "airplane mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take-off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to complete their need to do tons of work by US airlines, but do not pursue any immediate plans to amend their rules.
The air navigation service office CASA also said that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia remain.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it has been announced.
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about the widening of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declared that it is open to changes, but they must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic equipment by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience now that we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one spokesman.
Qantas said that the current regulations will remain before the time being.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all levels," said the FAA.
In rare cases in case of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended using heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments during take-off and landing.
A persistent injury to the ankle is threatened with preventing Nicolai Müller from taking part in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is about a dedicated job by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his efforts at short notice," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goal scorer with six goals.
The Mainz people already have to do without the injured top performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours presents the district association show this weekend in the town house.
The reviews were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local club W514 hosts this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder headphones their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and distinguished outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the assessment of all the animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition is held by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 pm.
Open to all visitors, the rabbit show is already open on Saturdays from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3.30 pm, which is followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle equipped with stately prices and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Severely injured after collision
Early on Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately locked the street completely, but could say little at first for the course of the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is certain that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was heading towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf was coming towards her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so severely trapped that the fire brigade took almost half an hour to remove her from the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both victims were killed in nearby hospitals.
The route was fully closed for about two hours.
British police give Assange an extradition notice
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australian had delivered a "demand to face up," which called upon him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not comply after this, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden for charges in a sexual offense after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the USA, he had on 19. June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London sought refuge and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "a 40-year-old man invited a request to face a police station at a time when we chose," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the service of the police request.
Assange fears that he was being extradited to the United States by Sweden and charged with possible charges of espionage after he published over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkran Dunningen will frame two services with Franz Schubert's "German Mass".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which inspired the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Fair at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26. October, this extraordinary fair will be held as of 19 during the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and Sunday, 27. October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in the St. St. John's Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Voices to the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a sacred musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The fair will be listed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind group of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Scientists could shed more light on the connection between a dog's tail flucration and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more tocline to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known in humans that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just as in humans, the right brain hemisphere was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail flucoping, the researchers monitored the animals while these films were looking at by other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analysed the behaviour.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (as seen from the perspective of the winging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilt was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that waves), so their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate with each other deliberately through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "When you have different encounters with other dogs and the waging with the cock is more associated with friendly behavior in one direction and the right side produces less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and guest holder at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if it is a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, it said: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his tantrum went left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the other way than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could because the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior can be simply recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as British prime minister, but admits that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself on British politics, and has mostly confined his comments to the foreign policy and role of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard in London as saying: "Yes, certainly, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers hide charred body
The fire brigade had to move out in Helmbrechts late on Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district Hof catches fire on the night of Friday.
The emergency services recover a charred corpse from the house.
Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already shooting out of a window.
The volunteers went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned down completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building was no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Konstanz: Cyclers rides around 63 year olds
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was unlawfully on the left side of the station square on the left side of the station towards the market site.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man from a restaurant stepped onto the sidewalk, according to the police, the cyclist could not slow down in time.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and switched to a wound of about 15 centimetres long.
An ambulance team took the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.

UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now starting to develop a number of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals to counter poverty twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to "think out of national interests."
"I am pleased that the member states have agreed to tackle a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also intervened in the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music are currently coming together at the Jazz location in Stuttgart.
Özdemir thus contradicts the favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22. September is the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorder of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the Jazz and Pop degree programme will then be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
Pawns are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative representative every month and her husband works, the monthly family income has not reached, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third pawn store this week listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pledge jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Pupplying homes in Singapore demand an annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is only just over the 15.4 percent requires the United Overseas Bank, a local loan originator with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawns offer the advantage that no check of creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pawn shops after families feel the pressure from rising costs of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economic areas, looking for lower- and middle-income deposits families to compensate for the difference in stinging-squaring economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's increasing household debt described, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weak export and a decrease in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs of gold prices over the past two years have increased the trend towards pledgeing personal items, as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 pawn houses of the city state of gold.
People say to themselves, "The gold price looks good, let grandmother's gold chain pawn and bring back next month."
The largest Thai pawn shop owner, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent customer increase in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it earned this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawns not only offer cheaper interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own and the liquefaction of personal valuables do not increase the household school school," she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secure financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn lending are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the valueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick shell for Shiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the "Bullen" was shown to be disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the swallow kings category," he defended the two offensive disabilities on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, during which the Senegalese became an alleged acting became a dismissal - which was of course not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crass wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described arbitrator Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would have also contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He decidedly defended his German compatriot: "I would have acted the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I would not know why.
"Because I am the one who was offended," the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the successful running, Rangnick made a praise anthem.
"There are only two words for this: really good," he stated.
There is not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
This should continue.
There will hardly be any changes in winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick clarified.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England even as early as the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
The Scottish Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said he was very pleased to be working with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and the north of €32.7 billion. Pound to 42.6 billion pound.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
However, it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" advocate for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner to the British Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates the benefits for all and complements the Glasgow Edinburghh connection, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the UK ministers next year and jointly adopting the next steps.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
It is only a few minutes away from the city by public transport.
"Hopefully you are not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment at age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-forty lady has had to experience what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book by her has been published on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, in mid fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
However, she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most displace it as long as it goes.
Old always become others,' she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry about it.
'But then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in old age.
'What a residential form you choose is always an individual decision,' explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, one can also be united in the dolce vita,' the specialist book author willing to leave the situation.
Their models include classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioner share.
In old age everyone has his ticks and quirks
'For me, however, such a shared apartment would be nothing,' she says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student shared apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'You simply need your retreat spaces at age,' says Ries.
The author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior citizens' shared apartment can still work.
But this would have to be different than in the classic student flat.
And sometimes you just want your rest,' believe it.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, she is not alone.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as long as they are doing,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Bürgerservice life in the age of the state capital.
Your office advises people on the subject of 'becoming older'.
For this reason, especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions, only to stay in their familiar environment is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends to all those who deal with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or their apartment to inform themselves thoroughly first and not commission the first craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rented apartment, one or the other can be realised, and if it is only the raising of the toilet seat, the interior designer explains.
But the existing apartment cannot always be redesigned for age-appropriate and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to do this experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more grueking at her door than in front of the spider.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revelation Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany to investigate the increasingly explosive NSA plan affair.
According to the presentation of the Green Member of Parliament, Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was concerned with the conditions under which the ex-secretary employees would state at a German public prosecutor's office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Drivers seriously injured in the event of accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on their way to Grefrath at around 9.15 p.m. with her car on the Kempen outer ring.
As the left onto St. Töniser Straße wanted to turn, she overlooked the 37-year-old's coming car.
The ride eye collided.
The Aachen native suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Band League after six game days.
Tomorrow, the team of Ingo Ehlers will be the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season begins new for us.
"I hope that we will finally have his head free," says Ehlers behaved optimistically.
He finally has his complete squad at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Like us, Daverden also focuses on tempo games.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase in cover, which has recently left anything but a secure impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed against Nordhorn after the first victory of the season.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we are far from the favourite, because everything can always happen in the derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz wants to add to Morsum to launch a series.
Jan tenth Jodat is missing.
The A-young Joost Windßuß, who is active with double games at the A-Youth Bundesliga club HC Bremen, is celebrating its season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Cocaine-independent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a large police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Unterwelt size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in the drug trade after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was called "first class", nicknamed "Bash," was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by the police during a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police spent a series of house searches covering 1.5 million pounds worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted of two counts of ordination on the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial of two charges of obstructing justice.
He gave possession of the cocaine in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out during their investigation against Scarborough that he was in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and place the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after dropping the drugs, Scarborough regularly spoke on the phone with Ditta, who was dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, obtained the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it was revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the "lawy of lawyer."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office both under his private address and at workplace, and that he would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called important drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests, and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaking."
Ditta is charged with abuse of his position as a criminal defence, since he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these individuals.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus discredited his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta had any misconduct of itself and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I didn't have to pass on to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but do it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said, "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defense person to a criminal the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has deceived this trust and tries to entrench itself behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and disabled justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he found guilty of conspiracy to conspiracy to trade in the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total sentence of 153 years of drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself in which he said that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer to death row client in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality is the motivation for his work.
Until now, the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to pokey children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains, there should be no property damage.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were probably also ignited in the urban area, but no property damage has occurred here either.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car were wrapped in cloth paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the police arrive, however, the man found his bike shields in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to work any further.
A day of thank you at the MGV in Dinker
It was 165. The foundation festival that the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club restaurant of the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed harmonious cooperation in the name of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity to make honours.
Secretary Rolf Wagenerer was delighted this time about the special award "Sänger of the Year".
"You not only wrote down a lot for us, but also made some rounds for us, but our heartfelt thank you," says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity were made this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Sänger des Jahr" Friedrich Winkler, with 42 participants each.
Fifth place spent Notenwart Artur Brückner.
The board gave a particular thank you to the team of club farmer Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir rehearsals at 7.45 p.m. in the club restaurant.
"New voices enjoyable are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
Council picks tracks
Should the "Am Hirschen" level crossing be converted extensively to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to pick up EUR 220 000.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
Particularly increasing safety at level crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions between trains and other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they have to participate in the costs with one third, the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the local council the special features of the baht crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an overhead of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those that transport long wood, could also stand there without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a requisite retaining wall in such a way that the city could broaden the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the local council, since some councils drew into question the necessity of street distribution: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money into their own hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The "Deer" level crossing is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported across this route, because the up to 20 metre long vehicles could not use the line at the Häberles Bridge, because they could not turn there into the main road.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
It is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels had to be converted and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Kirschen" could also be important traffic importance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have investigated what cost would cause the proposed widening of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority of the reconstruction of the level crossing was approved with the proviso that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city could, if necessary, remove the subsequent street towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to around 5.5 metres.
The conversion of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could entail a completely different problem, which affects the access road to the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the conversion plans of the railway investigated by the engineering office Breinlinger, since it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was still possible without further ado.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be ruled out that the road slopes could lead to longer vehicles being sitting.
The city, in turn, bears responsibility for this as a road construction load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the turning functioned in the current state of expansion, they should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is also significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because there is a halt Mitte directly next to it, to which there was a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station must have been slowed down at this point that no collision would be threatened.
The conversion of this level crossing was denied a majority consent, since the city of Schiltach would "would have to swim out the problem with vehicles based," according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" and "Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been concluded.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas era
Construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, explained the Gazprom Executive Board.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction works on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, have begun," said Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensure an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" were eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Vienna Airport makes passenger calls
Mr Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Anything like this will no longer be available at Vienna Airport Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements is thus eliminated - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend by stopping announcements affecting individuals.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai, among others, are already refraining from making some noisy views.
Due to the elimination of these announcements - on average around 200 personal calls to be heard through the loudspeakers in one day - it is intended to approach the airport in the future.
"Earnings have also shown that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information on changed gates or departure times is also lost a bit," said Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, the festival is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to appear in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as from "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy franchise for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby perform, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who are participating in the festival this year have become known about rather unconventional paths, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom in cable television (the ironic slippant fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast both on "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes, W. Bareau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
An interview with the festival's biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in Larry's comedy DNA of all the work," said Steinberg.
He told me that if he is here, then sometimes he goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again stuck in children's hands.
Traditionally, the museum is the name of visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday programme welcomes to a colourful children's and family celebration with numerous hands-on activities and events.
"Large and young can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release says.
Whether to make soap, turn candles, felt or manufacture ropes, there is a suitable one for every age.
The children can help regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop is also edited.
The young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship when building cuckoo pollen, water wheels or spinning.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrows races or stilt races, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle through the museum on Saturday and on Sunday, at 12 and 2 pm. respectively.
On a tour of the terrain, children have to guess which stories are true or lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his saucer barn with the museum guests from 11 am.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner is cosy and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 pm.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seams, the climber, the weaver and the bakery can be looked over the shoulder in her traditional work during her traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf also had to inform himself in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald funding centre, he and the managing school principals of the vocational schools as well as the district grammar school and the parents' advisory board chairs were investigating this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasised Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who introduced the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district grammar school and the vocational school centre in the Wälderstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also the phase to care for relatives due to demographic change," explained Wolf.
He also assumed that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already come to know the advantages of the region during their studies will often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to strengthening the region," said the president of the state parliament.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
On his way from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Stay persistent and make sure that public transport is improved," he said to the local politicians present.
Australian appeals against prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially held by a provincial court in Phuket on 15. Took June guilty of making a false statement after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had she had in the morning hours on Sunday, the 10th anniversary. June, raped, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the video camera's footage showed that she had safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to thinking up the story.
Until the court hearing, she was in police custody on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, held in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player in the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back to Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the sentence and is entitled to bail 50,000 Baht in release.
In Australian reports, it was said that she is spent in the meantime in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court said that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could endeavour to improve its preventing its preventing tourist image and therefore an acquittal occurs.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the construction fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the terrain is threatening to slide.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had discussed the beautification process with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the BI action, a banner with the message "We are in favour" was attached.
However, this did not bother much in their action by the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against construction ruins".
With this she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - was to fail one day's huge project.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city would be better off to many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as BI.
But they begin to resign because the city further delays these answers, it is said by the BI.
How it was heard that the public statements of the mayor are also having an effect.
In May, at the local council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the extract for the thermal bath if the population vote in the referendum against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem scared, while others feel it as a "plume blackmail attempt" to the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all helpers.
Syria has destroyed its possibility of producing chemical weapons, thus a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and guft gas ammunition, said the Global Monitoring Group on chemical weapons on Thursday, while there were severe clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war had been killed almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date of the
1. November, which the Damascus-based organisation based in The Hague had set to destroy or "unique" all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing arms and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, who said experts say there was a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits, as the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory said.
The activist group, which is pursuing the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said that 120.296 people had died on Thursday.
Of these, there are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 they included President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On the 25th The UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not specify any details.
The fighting underscores the danger to which chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team was "now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned in Syria and witnessed their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said the visit to two facilities were not possible due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that, according to the Syrian statement, the two sites had been "abandoned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been shifted to other mentioned facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will have to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I prefer the hat of the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Surveillance Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, are fighting a secession of Shia Islam in this civil war.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, such as two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly picking up.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities to cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation, which the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business entailed.
The bank, which made no comments on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation on this issue continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS had passed on the recordings of emails and instant messages sent from and to a previous trader to the UK supervisory authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of Forex Spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, saw leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers were accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, told people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that it was investigating the suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently investigating allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said individuals familiar with the situation.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years of searching for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has caused traders to be in turmoil in an area that has become one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said it was nearly impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks mean that "even with very low ticket prices can be influenced by the market."
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week it had terminated a trader in its London Exchange Traded Funds office after it caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and works with them.
"We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by the then Secretary of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive specialist" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and hack Pawlby's voicemails, and watched it, but Coulson also called it and left news, as the court learned.
"According to the public prosecutor's opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not one who stands in front of people's home and hopes to catch them for a new deed, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW use three procedures to investigate stories investigative: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, it may not be different.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first taken up by the feature editorial team of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't miss your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time the research was running, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asked for information about them, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw monitoring the Pawlby movements.
On the 18th In June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis said that Couleon's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett because of an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny himself to have conspired with others, between the 3. October 2000 and the 9th August 2006 Click next telephones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the telephone hacking.
Early puberty: Get up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age-giving gives, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean immediate puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight years of age breasts and pubic hair?
At the annual conference of the Pediatricians' Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist explained Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not an indication that puberty is coming quickly," Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious displays of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair as well as body odour, show themselves in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has only been a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the media age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to become a mentor," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently arising problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is disputed what actually represents the onset of puberty, but it is "premature" when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt over the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progression, tests by an endicronologist could be indicated so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending away from another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to obstacle growth and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is restrained in terms of medication, but he admits: "The oppression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their age-giving."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter received her days at ten days.
Even though there were the first signs and we had talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and excitedly because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come into puberty similarly like girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, who establishes a relationship between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other investigations support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age-like great-wingers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be affected by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys were growing earlier face and jibe hair, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is found even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true start of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
"This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who blossom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if he comes earlier than expected.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to master the circuit over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel reports from the organising sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude, there were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby in a competition atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placings at the German Championships.
As expected, these were able to settled down from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again in second place.
Among the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare, who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Lake Illmen and Leonie drivers from Owingen came in second and third place.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years among the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
More absolute top athletes were at the start of the main race this year.
Four drivers were able to break away from the regional top drivers.
These include Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional of the Black Tusk Racing team.
Together with a team-mate, Pangerl has been world champion twice in twelve-hour driving.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in the duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was an eye-clash finale in the finish before the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only a second behind it, the experienced Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished as third of the overall standings.
In the women's classification, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place was achieved by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized process of the event.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, thus official sources
Israeli fighter aircraft attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said that it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA 125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Before the district throne against Schalke, travelled with BVB fans with light rockets had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost eerie acoustics, which offered the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans with their songs were to be heard.
The southern stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans are located, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle cries.
The platform of Capo, who otherwise coordinates the joint fuel, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stand, a large flag was blowing lonely with the inscription "Section Stadiumverbot".
Only as the first BVB player took the place as the first BVB player as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, short-term jubilation marked out.
When his team-mates followed, there were loud singing and blowing scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand nothing occurred.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not make a celebratory mood.
The Capo climbed his podium only five minutes before the kick-off - and the hitherto tangible tension with the previous hand exclaimed in a loud scream, when Dickel requested the atmosphere in the ranks of the stadium as usual.
The last thing was the turn of the south stand - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was as usual here again.
And at the latest when the vocal invitation "Derbysieger stands up" came at the latest when there was a wake-up from the south stand.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of recent days.
Immediately before the prec Bezirkderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailer gun breakers had fired in the spectator ranks and onto the square - and almost met Roman Weidenfeller goalkeeper.
The game was belatedly kicked because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the heads of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe that Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from making a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in matters of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras has shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, says Watzke, BVB will set a penalty until the end of next week.
"That will be drastic," Watzke assured.
It is impossible to see how the reactions on the south stand will then be.
What happens to my email?
E-Mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Was the correspondence secret technically implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail, similar to traditional mail?
The design of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols were not taken to create a stable foundation for an listen-safe correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user sends "Anna" to "Benni" a mail, are then the computers of the two connected directly?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if it has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can be run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are conventional e-mails read on their way through the net?
Most mails are read several times on the go by software robots.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also made on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to base context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail via their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also keeping the emails?
The probability that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With great technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easily possible to recognise who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
According to an investigation by Convio Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were last, GMail from Google was able to gain significant growth.
Germany's largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor's profession.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church in Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved according to the current situation until 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Protestant press service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the job and daily routine itself.
With Burfien, the state church commissioned for the first time a pastor in a full position to inspire young people for the study of theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churchization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am in the Lord of my schedule and I can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Surely there is more paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a secure employer.
This is what comes today's young people who are not only concerned with careers, but about meaningful work.
According to the regional church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it will be difficult to occupy positions in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology degree offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual offences related to children before allegations were made against the child nursing officer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as learned by the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children.
However, when the opening statement to the commission was given the opening statement, the YMCA had stated that "in the organisation never had to deal with an incident of child abuse of sexual abuse."
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with misconduct with child pornography, and another where a sports teacher from the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew of the first case, but had not known the second.
He acknowledged that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there had been provided external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA with 21 acknowledged that management had failed to "turn from me on" when hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year for sex crimes of twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, disputes that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, sitting on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time was very unapproachable."
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements by employees that they had not dared to report their superior.
Instead, he said, rather, had affected their friendship with Lord's judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare said that he had told the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" concerned "do not reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality commitments shortly after the accusations had been made by the YMCA's editors' manager, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children in the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, child sexual abuse expert, told the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in the recruitment, review, induction, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was held until 20. December postponed.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
A sewer from Roman times is preserved over a length of around 120 metres below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne do not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise into the sky about 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two delicate church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted an car-friendly city, and therefore of the remains of the old city walls only what was not too big remained.
Most of the parking garage therefore now also rush past the Roman remains and only stop their car.
But those who take a closer look will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grids in the park deck D2.
On display are about five metre high ruins made of hand-drawn-sized stones.
"They are the remains of the Roman city wall, which was built in the second half of the first century AD," says Schulze.
Before we go back to light, Schulze lets the participants take a look at a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft on the upper park level.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants descend back into the depth.
We are witnessing the official residence of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the preactor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City of Roman Law and the City of the Agrippinser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the Place of the Altar for the Imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman sewer, which has been preserved here over a length of around 120 metres, leads.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze makes the guests feel at home.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After he has brought the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual ablutions.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be seen through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction will soon begin.
However, it will be a few years to go before it was completed.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as an overhead car park.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle input between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as a way to world-class events.
We are delighted to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the strains and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoy developing the Defender Challenge car – it will be an entertaining mastery.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February, as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new story of terror to independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border along the Hadrian's Wall secured with barbed wire.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but it did not play a role – as expected – in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often bending their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at present, continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what you really want from the Scots.
So no story.
And one that has already come so long in years that it is already like a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance it after the European pipe?
Why trade the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
That is the real European news: the great plan for unification of Europe, which was set after the war, has stalled.
The European project has officially died with the euro crisis.
Everywhere in the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative party for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the federal election in September, thus effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the straitjacket, in which the respective national economy is forced by adhering to the common currency, many people believe that the European project has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe is reflected with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times the gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wagon pictures of the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt comes up, especially in France, the former EU leader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin does not need more to Paris as a door to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, which is what the ailing French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive by-election, making the ruling socialists in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What makes Le Pen with its rewr popularity among the white Frenchmen of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to reach: the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will meet in the not too distant future.
The EU will not go away, but it will become something more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect that Britain will distance itself from this project in the hope of ingratiating itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be in the rains of Atlantic alone.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can choose to be a region of (in the ultimate consequence) of small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can stick to where.
I suspect that Scotland could travel quite well in a looser European network if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing it the same as Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts, which Labour Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib were responsible for the coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide on independence now, only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels to have an austerity policy imposed.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no phone calls)
From takeoff to landing, travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, play music and watch films, but cannot make calls with their mobile phones, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference how quickly they would be implemented by the respective airline.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the rules for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from a number of airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the advanced use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can only take them off again when the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
Upon entry on the landing flight, passengers must switch them off again and they are not allowed to take off again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to the use of Wi-Fi at higher heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation has been implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – will benefit both sides," Glading commented.
We are honestly tired of having to feel like watchdogs on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to surf, exchange emails, text messages or download data under three kilometres remain prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are encouraged to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into airplane mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to publicly leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to shut down the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And more heavy devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not have the regulatory competence for telephone calls, not the FAA.
FAA may suspend ban on certain electronic devices when take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the National Transportation Safety Board, security expert for national traffic issues on CBS News, said mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb transmitter masts," says Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee, launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government would allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions for use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The limitations are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, this is mentioned, which up to a third of passengers forget or ignores the switching off of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of interference from navigation and communication devices by passengers were known, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they don't mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally release considerably less radioblasting than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only release minimal radiation when leafing through.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of relaxing the restrictions on device usage by passengers.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to determine problems, but could not determine any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes that the disturbance by the devices was real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only individual reports of pilots who want to disturb aircraft system by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the shutdown of the devices by the passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor visibility.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would now be extensively equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits Black Forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": The Pro7 star Bonndorf visited for the TV show "Galileo".
The speaker makes it clear right from the start: the most important thing for the ham is the pig owls, turbo fattening is not a good prerequisite.
So can hams you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he is allowed to reach for the microphone.
Jumbo sighted for strengthening fast food in Waldshut
"Here, there are works on huge quantities," amazed the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat percentage, colour: Uli explains what is important in quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the flesh also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the pH value.
"I'm curious if you tell Roberto Blanco what happens then," Jumbo says cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But looking is still worth it.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the clubs is still handmade.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing are visually reminiscent of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"This is really delicious," concludes the TV star.
This will enable all parties involved to live.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions host
With a narrow squad, the Herren I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Göningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen.
The sleeves were standing on the other side with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the city of Freudenstadt.
With the hard and placed serves the Gönninger were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly via the centre of the net and were not there in the stations of the block defence.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the city of Freudenstadt in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and game-determining performance, the third set was then won a little lax and listed for the 3-0 final score (25:13, 25:22).
There will be on the 2nd place With TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly assert itself in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent is on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a highly competitive two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially when receiving the ball; even with the passports, the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical play scenes the look for possible point wins prevented the view of possible point wins.
In this very balanced encounter in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, however, the great physical commitment and a pleasant commitment of both teams are right.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," said Mayor Jens Häußler, who opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to be explained by the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and bring in ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The members of the municipal council make the final decisions."
The flood, the Gechingen on the 15th anniversary. According to Häußler, he said that there was a drastic event in May 2009, which raised the question of protective measures for the future.
A river basin investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up properties as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
According to the German Weather Service, the planning of protection is based on a flood that can be expected every 100 years.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
In expert circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a percentage flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the HQ 100a climate protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that there was only funding if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the conservation concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the tributary of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retention basins are planned to protect the location.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner at the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure with neighbouring towns of the old town, who even with normal thunderstorms repeatedly suffer from an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for canal systems were other than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be reached.
The sewers to larger dimensions would devour millions.
The newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to turn the name into a program.
According to the lexicon, déjÃ Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that we have experienced or seen a new situation before.
If you visit the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district town of Kleve, it does not have to stay within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has exactly that: not only to make an actual stay possible, but also tangible, but tangible.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A glance at the inside at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The ultra-modern, but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the head pampered the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually sandwiched fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as a restaurateur before the opening of the pretty café at Opschlag: In Kranenburg, they ran the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag, the friendly café lovers hope to become more audience.
Not least through the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two want to appeal to young students as much as they are senior citizens and all age groups in between.
Speaking of café lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most diverse variations.
Express sofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"To do this a baguette - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were already two events in the bright café.
Better said one thing.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - Café DéjÃ Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Nice, successful and funny," said the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a very fan of event evenings because of this: "You can't do it all right."
And I always talk to an event that is interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible."
The same means: DéjÃ Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlag in Kleve.
The road that is increasingly becoming a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the host romelia and thus also the Café DéjÃ Vu for themselves.

Jumbo manufacturers dispute in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class during long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those airlines who are trying the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week, which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US arch rival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November record orders are expected.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten rows – is crucial for the indicated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" leads 406 people at seats in the tourist class that are over 17 inches wide and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share hidebes about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to take the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed funders a picture in which three people squeezed together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul seat flights that are tighter than regional turbo-props," says Airbus CEO John Leahy.
With changed eating habits, people are getting fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul trip, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male american between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to the data of the US Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male mean American in the 21st century. According to US health statistics, the century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival holds on to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the newly named "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus' numbers to seat measurements and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between fares and establishment.
The company also explains that according to the investigation, the experience on the aircraft depends more than the seat width.
"It really comes to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe they need to succeed," explains Boeing's Kent Craver Flight Cabin Expert.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it is increasingly becoming an issue that can have an impact on revenue.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the USA or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results sometimes depend on the 777X comparing the 777X with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in cost per unit is still lower than with currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats on your plane to make it more competitive our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row with existing 777s indicated that many passengers decided to use the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fares.
"Eighteen-strises seat width would be great for passengers, but it is a reality: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, cabin member, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world travelling jet sellers even carry band measurements with themselves to remeasure the establishment in the competition.
Even if they promote comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seater rows, but has not sold one according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability for the cabins and offered a wide seat on the aisles for a few jets.
Without the support of the single other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably fade away, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
According to encyclopedias, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs considerably from it.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edam, these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan allows the vegan to all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may ask oneself, but on closer inspection, the vegan food world is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food company, which holds a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction was not only because of the diet, but also because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers imitation leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday issues are also possible without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," says Proctor, the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of burghering, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, its veg is not a renunciation, not asceticism, but it is an enrichment." The assumption that one reduces the choice of food options with the change of diet, Proctor is more attributable to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditionings that made some even better-minded attempt fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And says: "Certain tastes are not to be tied to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste, but that cannot only be reduced to animal food," says Proctor.
He had not suffered health damage, including eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take up any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are very good, I often let myself be checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are nourished with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat buying in the freezer," says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to eat the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are ok," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go a long way for food procurement.
After all, staple foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on site.
Only now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is also known to be "ordinary" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the house kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not sometimes better, results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new role.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was sceptical about it.
Does my food no longer taste?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with instinct.
"I don't reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan-beside as assumed - and the vegan is not as limited in everyday life as it is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many kebab stores offer falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he avoids pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of custom.
The restaurants are slowly adjusting to this.
"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, draw the attention to it."
"When enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
There are basically vegan dishes for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat courts, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also contain in peanuts as a colour provider, one seems to leave the courage with so many hurdles and falling with the observance of the ethics.
Not only is Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen writing a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that food and cleaning agents are buried.
"You gradually develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to "Sometimes small steps to do than stop or stumble," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointing that strikes at consciousness.
Perhaps he doesn't quite manage to get down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
Bayern's Basketballer optimistic despite the first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to diminish the huge optimism of FC Bayern Munich among the basketball players.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening with defending champion Olympiakos Piausäus.
We sent the message: there is also basketball in Munich!
At their third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich residents sold very well for a long time, but were simply not calm down in the decisive phases.
The guests initially managed to turn a 15-point backdrop into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game a turning point again.
"We fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich residents who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series master Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona GÃ3ra.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill pleasure in smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further attempts are needed, which can take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop while trying all the methods available on the market, but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in their blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice that were administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
However, mice without vaccination had taken a "time out", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if it was quite safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, smokers would use it to stop.
"They know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put the habit of putting on," he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot impresses with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier fare than necessary.
The plot, playing in France of the 1760s, tells the moving story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never glides in lust or sensationalism – and that is its problem.
The solemnity with which the film is told makes it a curry penitent shirt for the audience.
Egypt swors in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is not allowed to mark the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of court dressed in black robes, who has his seat on the Nile and is based on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the festive ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been sharply targeted by the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and in contrast to the presidential splendour from the Mubarak period, traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the autoconomy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "substitute wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the attempts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
"Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," explained the Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber, where he avoided the office.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band that played the national anthem, which he listened to in prayer position.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendants in the largest lecture hall at the university with chants of "The army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday, the birthplace of the uprising that last year led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken from the head of state, who had hailed from office.
However, with the abandoning of the official oath to court and not as usual before parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history at the men's singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in whose frame he was solemnly honoured.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing is still great fun for him with the choir, which has probably gained more than loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
He has received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Association of Cecilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a document of the association and a document of honour signed by Bischof Gebhard Fürst, since the choir is also a church choir.
His singer colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st was reached. Autumn festival in the usual tracks: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had invited a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles, which maintained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Vine Paradise" and "Funny, Her Brothers".
They prepared a little serum for their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied" (Bundeslied Song) for honour.
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "Wann you go through the valley".
The song wreath of Salzstetten provided the female quota of the festival with his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulse choir".
The mixed choir kidnapped "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus to foreign lands with the Neapolitan folk tune of "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana", while the "impulse choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Club came back to home gece with "Was ischer der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" in local gece, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Punch Theatre and read a few stories that the children were busy at noon.
Frontier Airlines charges carry-on baggage fees
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 US dollars from passengers who wish to store baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for one piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, although passengers were allowed to keep the whole can in the announcement on Wednesday.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said that they calculate 25 US dollars if the fee is paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the fee of 100 US dollars is targeting to persuade travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this amount," she explained.
Airlines began to charge fees for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid them have therefore clipped as much as possible into their luggage luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to persuade passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers, who clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier boarding gate may be allowed to take one bag with you free of charge, but the next person will have to pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of baggage.
O'Malley said that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures were changed, so that passengers were informed of the fee before they reached the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only come into effect in the summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to use it.
They argue that transporting the baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished.
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage fees to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss.
However, most of them have so far avoided the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed the first charges for hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also followed by a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional fees closely.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the Spirit hand baggage fee earns 50 million US dollars a year.
Sorensen, who used to hold a leading position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected at the gate when passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand luggage.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest things I experienced in my aviation career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and tangible discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding was lubricated."
Frontier also follows spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should retain the entire can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks, but spent seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had pursued.
Frontier's step to charge charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to persuade passengers to buy directly from them instead of an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company started to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight with a third-party ticket with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore only earns customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats on the Frontier website only when buying directly.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report, which was published on Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get a grip on Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Sleep in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it started right away at Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here there was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep", the day in Times Square was decided.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached with a ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Then it went via the financial centre to Wall Street to the memorial of 11. Septembers.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building, while enjoying the view.
Then we went through the hustle and bustle of New York's streets via Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a location for real estate.
The economic framework is right and the financing options are excellent.
This is the tenor of the 9th. Real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country in the comparison of Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, held its 9th edition. Property day of the stock exchange newspaper is notified.
According to Ulbrich, how wanted German commercial real estate is shown by a view of the transaction volume.
In the first three quarters of this year, it rose by 31% compared to the same trend in the previous year.
In the United Kingdom, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The yield distance between real estate and government bonds is at a historically high level.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accidents believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family lawyer explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was born on 11. February found in an upright mat that stood behind the stand in the school gym.
The sheriff's sheriff of Lowndes County's investigating officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he had died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that every logic is lacking, violating the laws of physics as well as against common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and returned to the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, since a number of important issues were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they are leading.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicates that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-based suffocation."
However, a second autopsy had caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready for a comment immediately at our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.

John Kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that the US espionage "had gone too far inadequately"
John Kerry hinted with an unexpected admission to soften the US defensive stance regarding its surveillance programs, saying that in certain cases, the espionage had "ented too far in certain cases."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for turning to "autopilots" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden on the spying of the NSA became public.
The leaked information means that the US government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies.
In a video-linked speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the President and I and others in the government have learned about some things that have virtually expired by autopilot, simply because there was the capacity to do so, what was still happening on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course on the 11th. September goes back."
He was then the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that the US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far inadequately."
The President is determined to clarify and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse taking place.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this trial.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its monitoring processes.
He added, "We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in the anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday said.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans will stay on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first Democrat in the Senate and chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue working together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe has strained relations with some U.S. allies, even though intelligence head this week stated that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA had overseen the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage to allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of Congress, which is to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said that European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also resign themselves to the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is embarking on a trip to the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to engage with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.

In cooperation with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Messenger wants to support the facilities in the realisation of their construction and beautification requests.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and nurseries from the entire Zollernalb district can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or beautification wish for your facility, you can apply with it to Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten Construction campaign.
A jury, consisting of representatives from Black Forest Messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the requirements for participating?
The desire should be realised with a maximum of building material worth 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide many hard-working builders.
What is it about the day of action and the helpers?
With the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus provides the material.
It will be delivered to kindergarten on the agreed day and should then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott would face a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, which is in a legal dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars in CO2 tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to cancel or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He finds himself in a large conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives holidays or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission Palmer officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with a 53 vote lead after the recount.
Palmer demanded a revision of the voice counting process to make it happen more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which you march in, enter the data into a computer, immediately dials and then have the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Voting with pencils is incredible to nowadays.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about serving the public.
"We do not strive for any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Nobody knows whether there is at least on some of them life.
The selection is difficult: should one look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after Earth-like planets searching and thus perhaps discovering alien life?
The leaders of the European space agency Esa are asked these questions.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make a decisive advancement of research.
The budget for such "L missions" each is around one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for discussion, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, follow up on the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific programme committee.
A total of four big questions have been chosen by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be examined more closely.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomers could depict Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the Solar System work?
This question is also ultimately to shed light on the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field, as well as the particle radiation it emanates to the planetary system.
These processes can be examined in our solar system as an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa envisages the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations, which could lead the physicists to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come about and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created through the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, of stars, planets and living creatures as we consist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
Until now, the researchers have neither known which physical laws were valid in the first fraction of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M-Mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chance of permitting as an L-Mission, a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
This means physicists understood changes in the structure of the space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were formed in the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to investigate black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is supposed to track down and investigate Earth-like planets.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as on solar physics have already been eliminated.
CDC release allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a number of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has now a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching staff and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools can make pinephrine more easily in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like the hair is lying on it" or "My tongue tingles."
Fire brigade called to rescue a dog, which was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky outcrop in a quarry
Cocker spaniel Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters hurried off on a rock face and saved the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog to safety, which was stuck on a 15-metre-high advantage in a rock face.
The nine-month-old Cocker spaniel bitch Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, whom the dog belongs, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire Rescue Service.
They had been desperately looking for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she had run out of the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and absed to the rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her salvation – it was frozen as if it was frozen.
But now she is doing well.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
This was a pretty unusual task.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge luck."
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but found nothing apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe that it was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold them in their arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so thankful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed at the top."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where it was.
US Border: "Super Tunnel" for drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and closed a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to the US customs authorities, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were therefore arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been used, according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig under the radar," said U.S. Southern California Attorney General, at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse where an end to the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy, assured to the drug gangs, "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 have been held in Mexico. 000 people killed in the context of drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that he was designed by architects and engineers and that the building took about a year.
The track layout was equipped so that electrically powered carriages could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 metres into the depths to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 metres in height and a width of 90 centimetres.
It would have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was captured for the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment as the maximum sentence of imprisonment, as officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it continued at the San Diego press conference.
It was the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the US.
No details were disclosed to those arrested, at least one being a Mexican, it was said.
They face prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama's Backset in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama retraced yesterday on his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of insurers received a letter of termination from their insurer, the Republicans accused the President of the last few days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the layoffs, Obama called on those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government described it unsuccessfully that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for another tariff, since their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the Washington House of Representatives' Energy and Trade Committee.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry like everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your confidence.
This saying a person ensued Sebelius as adviser behind her at yesterday's House hearing was opened after a dispute with Republican deputy Billy Long of Missouri. This was whether she should be committed to participating in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly belated with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a state-sponsored insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which it now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Parents of intersex children can choose "gender indefinite"
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third generation for children born with unambiguous genitals.
Newborn is no longer rigidly assigned to male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can state "uncertain" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for sexual assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later: "I am neither man nor woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born neither as a boy nor as a girl every year.
They belong to the intersex, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson was possibly intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that one should use the best available information on gender assignment, if determined is not possible, and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide – if any – for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sound after a good cause."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgery, but most children do not apply," he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity in the first are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it is happening.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-based, but conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defined both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These properties were shown in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intergender and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not coincident with the gender image now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male, female or "third gender" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "foreign" person after a court granted lifelong maintenance of a "undetermined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German identity cards will have a third allocation, X for intersexsexual, says the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition removing the "gender theory" from textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, on the grounds that "if the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"The parental existence is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of one's own child," she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god, who had both sexes.
Only ten years ago, medicine saw sex as something that could be erased and then rebuild.
However, now the ethical foundations of surgery are doubted, now that it is known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when they grow up with the gender they assigned.
“In the middle of the 20th This was called a 'psychiatric emergency'," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitalia goes to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who argued that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child's genes and hormones and thus coined whether a person considers himself male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during an eclipse during an eclipse completely to castrate and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 he switched back to the male family and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, which are "not happy with the result."
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical files.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one has ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough Testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation, it has become infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can "encourage to stamp and stigmatize".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign them to the child," she explained.
We fear that favours intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this point.
When they are adult, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexually differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorizing" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone.
It has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a childcare staff member.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives room to parents, which means that they don't have to make decisions hastily," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify things, thus giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – one pulls the child up and loves it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents' happiness.
And you don't have to do an operation hastily, which can no longer be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents is being concerned because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that fits better to him – and that is wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to Horst Janson's body.
Janson is himself an old hand in his profession, the art of acting.
Nobody can do anything to the old man Santiago when fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
One almost thinks to be able to see the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman's boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair bent, it is real in Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and will strength.
Janson is on stage as a single actor on scale.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in light: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the attitude to life of Cuba with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a shining treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shine – so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early phase of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible in itself because of the refraction of the light caused by the ice crystals, which make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Talk Forum
At the next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, 21. October, the New Museum of the castle deals with the theme "To hell with hell - theological considerations of today's handling of the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church congregations of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis cultural office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate the forum as to how people classify the "last things" after death today.
If people had known too much of it in the past centuries, focusing on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas today," the contemporary prophetic teachings of the hopes of perfection are more likely to be seen by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have lost us."
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
Associated with this is the question of that longing, "who dreams that everything may be good in the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair of systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: Fair provides answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that humans can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration succeeded has now given a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has found its way back into its way.
This starts with wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front are the dresses, which are often adorned with embroidery, often with a veil, but at the back they go down their backs and often end in a train.
However, there are the ghosts, as Stefanie Koch from the Kleidermüller fashion house emphasises.
In men's suit dominates with vest and plastin, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
It was explained that the selection of the restaurant was made.
Decorative side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the carriage house.
If you want to ride on the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But carriages are also popular for young club sayings," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, floral arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming in fashion - so photo series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in a stylish way.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, earned an avalanche of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was surpassed by him at Nortel's insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion dollars, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. district court in Texas.
Rockstar is in the joint community of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that put search terms on the Internet in accordance with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition to the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offering several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being surpassed by the Nortel patents of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion US dollars, a business that was partly motivated by Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed to purchase the patent at the auction with its attempt to acquire the patents, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," said the lawsuit.
Rockstar is demanding high compensation from Google, since it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Frankfurt parking fees are to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitively more expensive.
This morning, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation of educated by educator Stefan Majer (Greens).
Accordingly, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not the prices to be increased, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines is to be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibilities immediately before the business is "an underestimated advantage for smaller specialist retailers".
The German transport club is of the opinion that an increase is "extremely appropriate and actually long overdue" after two decades.
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Oil Price continues to down to USD 96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply of high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference raw oil for deliveries in December had fallen in electronic trading in Europe by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which marked a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large range of crude oils has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent grade, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger seat and back seat, hunger is noticeable.
Sure, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for that!
What close is than heading to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a small thing?
I admit that I am happy to be there when it comes to fast food gates late or early in the morning.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nix like home and in bed!
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable.
Because what do you need to lack that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?
Especially on the weekends, there are discarded paper bags at roadsides and on parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or the next trash can?
It is not only the case that the paperware binds the landscape.
Bags have already covered up transport facilities such as crash barriers and thus triggered accidents.
But not thinking about what thinks "disposable society", but probably she does not even know what this word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a rear bank can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are towering there.
A few bags would make up more or less nix - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of others.
I see the day coming when the towns and towns will become too stupid - and the fast food chains for their bags have to demand pledge.
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan nutrition requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Association calls others for World Vagapolis on 1. November.
The Vegetarian League Germany is beating on the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1st November a number of vegan alternatives before:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yoghurt can be replaced by soy yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Impact-bearing plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
For example, doughs instead of eggs are loosened with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yoghurt or silk tofu can also fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
A black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds space in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system for the financing of US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined forces with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly where they were driven – and can then use the information to calculate tax assessments.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while there is no agreement in Congress on action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years, where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we may be using," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning a record of miles driven on all Californian motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paying Americans at the petrol pump, is bankrupt.
But in America, no more is being done as much as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by even one cent at high fuel prices.
"The fuel tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most reasonable alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is well received by urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust fumes are reduced.
The Californian planners are relying on the system in developing strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally enshrined goals on climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of having drivers payed according to the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Reason Guidelines.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move towards miles-based billing.
The US Senate approved a 90 million dollar pilot project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance, responding to the concerns of rural deputies representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or the city in everyday life.
Several states and cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical at the thought that the government could pursue each of its movements.
"Moks against Big Brother and such things were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and result management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-grown monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can capture the mileage of driven miles, but not exactly when and where.
This says Khan, the public would also be more calmed.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally competing to help states tax on drivers.
Rather, its goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance, where drivers are to pay based on the miles driven.
However, the devices it tests are also interesting for street planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device at all and pay a flat fee instead based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other positions hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public sphere by equipping the devices with more functions than less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also pays for parking fees, pay for insurance only for kilometres driven, and speed data from other vehicles are collected in real time, thanks to which motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system," says a planning document from the city.
However, some traffic planners are wondering whether all the talk about paying per mile is not only a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume low gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and numerous other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports ground, despite the cold weather and the rain, lost the importance of the city and the football club.
A more pleasant celebration had everyone wished last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold such a reason had their sight.
This was possible with the musicians, who framed the ceremony, as well as some of the speakers.
FC leader Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, became wet.
He was particularly gratinful to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and members of the association, who contributed.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf in particular.
The sprightly pensioners laid 400 square metre paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, member of the state parliament, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn sufficed to the original lawn in such a way that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the secondary school on the Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came up to the laying down of an artificial turf pitch, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were started two years ago when FC took over the Schabelstube in hereditary lease, awarded a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and the land approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000, Klumpp summarised.
The construction of the 68 by 108 metre artificial turf pitch began on 4th. June.
During the construction phase, which lasted for three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which were used for the installation of a dirt bike route.
Unknown hurts girl by shot from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old one in Since Saxony-Anhalt during shootings from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired onto a group of children with an air pressure weapon in Genthin on Thursday evening.
This was what the police were told in Burg.
The girl was slightly hurt on the left wade.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car, which had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
They then drove away.
The criminal investigation department was investigated, it was said on Friday.
Snowden ready to "operate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US secret service, has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and testify to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a breach of loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with threat of punishment, in which defense is not possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
The German Minister of the Interior, Hans-Peter Friedrich, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that it should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this was possible, "without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the USA."
Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, Snowden, could not return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe there", says the deputy.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign exposed to him from his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to offer cooperation, "if the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to sing calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Out of fear for the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo almost daily, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the White-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
Following the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal storage facilities in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by holding it on the 17th. October its members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, would have attacked its members.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday, that Dhlakama considers himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo has been giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he had meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, and indeed seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidency and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de MoÃ3ambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidential office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has undertaken trouble-making attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga answered cautiously whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, sluggish progress in development and a recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No, Renamo and Frelimo are interested in, they just want peace and usable roads again," he explained.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were brought to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scenes game.
From the arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actress Alois Kraftzcyk had created an entertaining piece that was heavily acclaimed under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged leaps in time from youth to the approaching retirement.
On the 22nd place In October 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his Freihof.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his leading role as the great son of the city.
He presented stylishly with the pair and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood how to put herself in the shoes of the sister and gave her tremendous lives in mimics and gestures.
Between the individual game scenes, the Mühlenbach farmer's band played selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
At the award of honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honoured, who was representing the then incumbent in Hatland together with a part of the city council.
The Dreikönig singers, who prompted Hansjakob, to make the exclamation, subsequently made their respect: "Oh how beautiful, there are again youth memories of my own Three Kings alive."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out".
At that time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church just as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
He found his resting place in the homeland, behind his funerary chapel on the fire near Hofstetten.
"A restless spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever," said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and many of the praises of praise from the audience for the performance.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which on the front page had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defaming, should be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a former company.
The New Express will now be subjected to a "comprehensive rectification," the regulator declared.
The "Retlection Order" was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Department in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disordered," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said they decided to impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, "the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant those responsible be determined at the New Express and immediately check the New Express management team."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I harmed zooming as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it first and foremost because I was out on money and fame.
I realized that I have acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and said that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite an amendment to the law earlier this year, during which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to blame themselves.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baar town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, child, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet come forward.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen have so far been the only candidate for the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for reasons of age, has been found.
The application deadline is Monday, 11. November, at 6 pm.
Haigerloch: Last Supposary Church comes into the foreground
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourist office is dedicating the last of its public theme tours to the city on Sunday, 27. October, the Last Supper Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period was to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The cornering conclusion is a visit to the Church of the Lord's Suppre.
There, the leaders get the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant congregation in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also shows the Last Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Milanese model.
The meeting point for the an hour-and-a-half-hour guided tour is at 3 pm at the Atomkeller Museum.
There are maps at the cash desk in the nuclear cellar museum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Mick Jagger explains that he never started Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she had worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rock and that "he drove me when I was 18".
She added, "That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made an attempt to come forward at Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" ended up in number 1 this week.
NSA declares that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had swallowed up its public website for several hours and not hackers, as it was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, because an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the case of such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, is now found in the bright light of the public and faces sharp criticism after the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could make statements in the US scope in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, citing non-described circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified between the state, it was said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden threatened to ship there, it was continued
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life," says an author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutale power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who were "excessively didactic," children were "switched off completely," because entertaining stories would convey the messages "underly threshing".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the necessity to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally presented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of storytelling.
You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted pre-tax profit before tax of between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are achieved, this means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and held a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and UK private business.
"Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year, and some of them are well on track towards record year revenues before interest and taxes," he explained.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically one of our strongest income bearers.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which brought a slightly weaker market for business travel.
The flight centre's leisure business in the UK went similarly well, while business customers were spending less.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a profit for the full year is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20.
Falkenberger Discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today, Friday evening, it's "Pump this party", tomorrow's Saturday evening we continue with an over 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Post hardly empties on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday lease are still on various mailboxes of the city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow container of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying is no longer happening on Sundays and public holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether Sunday will be emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The social and youth policy spokesperson of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
The Sunday evaluation is an important postal service, especially for the time post.
"This company is radically and unacceptable despite the price increase for letters on January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, parliamentary group and city association chairman of the Liberals, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that emptying times are secretly changed or even deleted here".
The post office is located near the citizen.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner und Röhrenbeck in unison.
The core city also applies, particularly not mobile fellow citizens, to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday shows on foot.
In the city parliament, Röhrenbeck asked whether the city administration was planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, his knowledge also includes a Sunday show in Hofheim.
Their party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
However, Bloom said in an interview that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope for it."
Kerr and he still loved himself, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their sons Flynn was born in 2011.
Haslach: Scepticism is giving way to confidence
With the 2015 parish council elections, for example, the Haslach pastoral unit (SE) will change the fundamentals.
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new is reluctant but increasingly confidence.
The extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the main officials of the pastoral care team ranged from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the revised guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
According to this, SE Haslach as a congregation will in future form a body under public law that includes the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation board in which the parish priest Kraft is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called parish teams are formed in the six parishes.
In the future, it will be your task to promote church life in the town.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed considerable need for discussions.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets are preserved in the parishes.
By contrast, liabilities are transferred to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which all parishes then meet, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only investments were made in projects that could be mastered alone by the individual parishes," said Haslach's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried pastoral care unit, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
They had set themselves the task in 2006, "Becoming one, staying five" and had to realize that this was not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach chaplain care unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be specified in further meetings and agreed at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
At the end, the parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who imposed a seven % stamp tax on housings in the 2012 budget, costing two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the proceeds from the stamp duty on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeding the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "Following the increases in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of related legislation against a reduction, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more cautious when it comes to buying property in London, or to prevent owners from selling it," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the affluent London southwest belt that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has a record 11.8% in the price of 11.8% in the price.
Prices in Central London showed equal annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, says a review by Savills.
Even if SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four game days, there is still a good mood in the handball supreme team.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that at all.
All are still fully motivated.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know anymore what a victory tastes like," Malmon expects a sense of achievement from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet digested trees, Malmon raises the index finger in the run-up to warning.
I have coached many players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait whether there will be reinforcements from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the road to success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the past appearances.
Above all, the number of cover shows and switching games were very opolistic at the end.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved.
So I hope that my players will finally have her head up during the short break.
USA wants to prosecute Snowden further
The US has not changed its stance to the former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of sharing secret information without permission.
He therefore had to face criminal proceedings in the US, said the US State Department spokeswoman, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either.
After a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had previously appealed to the USA not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbeles' statements were that of a parliamentarian, not that of a member of the government.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the upcoming book, and reported on Thursday evening that the President's top advisers had conducted "Exciting group meetings and polls in late 2011" to find out whether it would be better for Obama's dwindling hope of re-election if he dropped a bidder.
According to Jonathan Martin, the national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect of exchanging the poll ratings of former Secretary Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the change in envisaged.
"Double Down" claims that Daley has been at the forefront of effort to exchange Biden despite her "creeping, personal relationship," before it was finally decided against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a whole range of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president had terrible poll ratings at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigations as "provided care," Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that significant effort had been made during the campaign to re-elect, to find out whether such a train pays off in terms of the ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about anything," Martin explained on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time had known about the potential change.
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was "conscious of the possible change," the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political exploratory had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he was serious thinking that Obama did not know if Biden should be dropped in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
Municipal council is pleased with solid household
Whenever it is about the budget in local council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The community säckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be booked as a complete success in this sense.
This became clear when the financial statements were presented for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million has been higher than planned at around EUR 7.6 million.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, is also around one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade tax income and the share of the municipality in the income tax.
The wealth budget was also significantly higher than the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher addition from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
With less investment than planned in the 2012 financial year, lower investment has also been higher.
In total, the general reserve has increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake out of the sleeve like this," Gerster praised with regard to the financial statements.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but it may be precisely these good figures that the citizens could soon be dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the community was able to do without high lifting stocks in the past.
This, however, has often reduced subsidies from the country, according to Gerster.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation poles.
Among other things, the towns and municipalities applying for grants must show certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, because investments are due in the coming years, for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleiner Heuberg affirm their profession of faith in Confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old young people from the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
The divine service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit.
By receiving the Significance of Confirmation, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the strength of the Holy Spirit.
The confirmands had prepared for the big feast day in recent months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous members of the congregation.
In various projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Cry of despair of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It is a book that I believed would be cheerful during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memory of Barack Obama's presidential election in 2008.
When I finished with my patient desks in the evening and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take my breath away.
The election became a landslide victory and newscaster stopped to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had approvals of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you were torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad admonition of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and varied things that Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-political blockade tactic has tipped too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama administration towards colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have ended up with my attempts at explanations.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican blocking policy cannot explain why one allows the listening of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans' private lives and why whistleblowers are punished who disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without proceedings, nor is there anyway the public financing and expenditure limits during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which states that the White House's efforts to encape the media are the "most aggressive since the Nixon government".
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the passing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that the work of the government could contradict the political campaigns it precedes.
Obviously, the office of parliament is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbaked alternative, he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from pressure from future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard from for so long.
But with the fall of Obama’s approval ratings to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become all the more harsher through this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have vanished into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to suffer a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to rediscover our spell," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It is five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Konstanz: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, there were an accident when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza sailed out on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
This led to a clash with the BMW driving there from a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old, driving behind the BMW, was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 property damage occurred, the police said.
The roadway had to be closed during the accident, it was said.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the municipal utilities, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorf family has additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is reset each year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These figures on the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can charge by means of an levy above the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf municipal utilities form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company had even spent a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete paid would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number rather being close to the 2 cents.
Josef Winkler has been writing himself the needs of his childhood and youth about the soul for more than 30 years.
The Carinthian poet has repeatedly described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - speechlessness, the tendency towards raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author, and theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose lyrics Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather Lumons on the Tip", which can now be seen in Garage X on St Peter's Square.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, belauernd seine Familie beläud" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crumpled sofa on which meaning paintings and masturbates - the eight-member ensemble shimmys through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text less than that.
The 70-minute performance covers the original with an abundance of directors, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Above all, the actresses come to the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are hard touched, dipped with their head under water, with their evening dresses stuck to the wall.
Forced in cellophane or bodice, they snap on dangerously high edges through the staging, either monologting them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strained way.
The best moments are the evening when they are sung - the spectrum ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the overdriven performance come to rest, and Winkler's almost absurd humour flashes.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of breaking the sports-derived Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball basketballs have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now a competitor for the Neckar giants less.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not apply for a possible poster.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, there was no first severe relief from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard process, so long it has not been determined that Düsseldorf will not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until the 23rd Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal in May and prove its economic sustainability.
So far, however, the Rhinelands have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
