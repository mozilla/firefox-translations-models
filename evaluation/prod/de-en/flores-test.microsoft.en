USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family is committed to providing a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are better served if we drive meaningful change within our organization rather than decertify.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could bring to light how abuse on the scale so courageously described by the survivors of Lary Nassar could go undetected for so long, and welcomes all necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the USOC share the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes so that they can follow their dreams in a safe, positive and self-determined environment.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was maroon on the top and light or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rachis, but have other features of feathers – barbs and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or for pointing out. The researchers suspected that although the sample is the tail of a young dinosaur, it shows the plumage of an adult rather than the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not chick down.
A car bomb detonated yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and wounding over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected a Daesh (ISIL) militant supporter was behind the attack.
They have found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it has been found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star related to the plasma current, luminosity and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is with respect to polarity reversals of the magnetic field.

The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12:00 GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare, growing violence, or a slide into chaos.
The report begins by asking for an open discourse and consensus-building in the US on a strategy for the Middle East.
The report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and urges an immediate change of direction.
The first of the 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile interventions and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational pulls on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal region.
In an interview, he said the new variant was "extremely troubling and alarming because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least two were medical hospital employees.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 of the 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent that they are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with the candidate of their choice registered in an envelope.
After the officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voters' list.
The French electoral law lays down the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are inserted except those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process as witnesses. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car sped in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained significant injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She remains in custody pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be biased as her picture has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently and the courts have found the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when you post photos etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is in charge of law enforcement, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return of the borders to the state before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics purportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence only for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying attempt to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial has been monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread dissident protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported with defective iPods. A total of six fires were triggered and four people suffered minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the equipment.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 other incidents of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious.'"
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Civil Protection Office of the Northern Mariana Islands said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had stated that there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady when she needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as a maternity physician and joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began studying preterm labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like them. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed ahead of the 2010 federal election, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle disciplines, as well as in three medley relays, but his fitness was doubted because of his many ailments.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain as they are banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and power life.
Since comets collided with Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially Earth, form.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political chatter and silliness."
There is speculation that he could run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground penetrating radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be provided and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on-site.
With concerns about a lack of transportation, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species in Ecuador's Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process had previously been thought to take much longer due to mating between a native Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into various forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images, called illuminated manuscripts, in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses frequented by men and women in mixed company.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere somewhat distorts our light and our gaze.
It takes a gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest service that the bike has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat far smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task that every cat has and that ensures that it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other if they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Pride of lions act similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are just as deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the power of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a sentence of growling roared words.
Ocelots eat small animals. If they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than he himself.
Scientists think that ocetons track and track animals for eating (prey) with their sense of smell. They sniff where they have been on the ground.
You can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually conforming to their surroundings and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (for example, when they move across a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food via the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any animal crossing its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and maybe even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. rex was no match for him.
While we may be familiar with most of their food, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called dormice.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs. The rich men, on the other hand, preferred to hold banquets together, where they lay on their side while eating their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods and the priests tried to comply with the will of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse legends it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Legacy of the Knights Templar," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293/4 inches x 241/2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state and which also somehow defines the size of a society.
City-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustained cultural footprint and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as veritable civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government on the basis of the federal treaty, consisting only of Congress.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive branch or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that its representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is together with the German national football team the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Cup winner in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
"Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as the 'archipelago'."
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in indigenous grain farming methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the government of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world's most widely used still image format is 35mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its image format was adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35 mm format confusingly measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main subject (see example).
In this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite different languages and customs.
His omnipotence dominated everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the churches exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being adhered to.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated universally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of sea, posing a threat even to neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different ages. Every period in China and every family in power was a dynasty of its own.
Between the individual dynasties there were also volatile times of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Epoch, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Also, after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could succeed.
The same is true for the military, because instead of class, army rankings were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (light) to meditate.
The cave itself has stood the test of time, offering a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if you know that it exists. Once inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can't see anything except the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world can be seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramid structures built to worship deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheop's wives and family members.
The "spread" symbol looks like a V and the "smear" symbol looks like a parenthesis or square that lacks the bottom line.
Upward means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downward means that you start with the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
Spreading usually produces a softer sound, while stroking is stronger and more expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; Keep in mind, however, that the printed arc markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be respected.
The panicked King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women in Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people making threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At one point, a member of the angry crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the horrified queen.
The war expenditures of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover most of the expenses, and interest on bonds flowed through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super-profits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people were the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas. On the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology itself has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than social.
It can be argued, for example, that the passenger car inevitably entails the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
Demand economy is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic type of farming that uses preserved seeds native to the ecoregion and combines them with alternating field farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or willful abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called 'feral' or wild. Some feral children have been held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within their physical capabilities) that are almost entirely consistent with those of their specific foster animal, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a new learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to cope with alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and educational, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of foster care is a piece of security for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster home is supposed to cover all the needs they did not get in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the utility and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "lasting relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who can no longer understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly assess people's honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human to meet its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences if you fail to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it shouldn't surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be achieved simply by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you are someone who turns the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effects) so that you are forced to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses correlates inversely with the level of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation is god yoga. By visualizing different deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the end of the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to the fact that the countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and, in reality, would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already collapsed completely, and the only hope was a retreat and redeployment along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to carry people and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to carry people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to bring manpower and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated as early as about 10,000 years ago in the Zāgros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals to easily get their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other grazing land.  The goats were looked after by goatherds, much like the more well-known shepherds; often these were children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, conveyor tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Sleepers were introduced quite early to secure the position of the rails. Gradually, however, the realization prevailed that rails that support a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. Man began walking upright two million years ago with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk as regularly upright.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and people's extravagant way of life.
After its passage by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or as bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately detectable. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The best sign of poisoning by ingestion may be the presence of an open container with drugs or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "bedbug" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from the age-old familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both predatory bugs and bedbugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States of America, making it the most prevalent neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or their child's interest to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is, in fact, the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it's not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by asking questions and conducting observations.
Scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
With the loss of Greek language skills, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviors determined by a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perform free-oscillating cycles for a period of time, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material in question, and whether the cells in question are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle service, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.x
In developed countries, you will rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because it is not possible to predict driver behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain constancy and can be represented mathematically roughly.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important properties were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roadway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and sexual partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their body.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small shelters where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold back their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system's movements.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), was moving around Earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn't seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and the most water-rich river on earth. It carries more than eight times as much as water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It absorbs water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then a good thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to people since ancient times, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. However, he also theorized that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe in its entirety consists of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has receded into the background, so it has been pushed back in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
It will be interesting to see what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. If the core is split again, part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they decay with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there might be more Maria as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want the exact things they do, and what influences around them make them do or don't do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of hierarchy of demand and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and make everything your own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run according to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be considered by local leadership.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organization go through the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, an organization's collaborative work to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative way of responding to customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations perform better.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition. Thus, they narrow down the research area and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage such as trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies enable us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our heads.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, setting strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become disciplines in their own right, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and military sectors, and has also been incorporated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. It is not uncommon for a teacher to take her students to places where a bus ride is out of the question.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, that usually changes when there's an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to learn more about the world around them." The need to capture the audience's interest inspires students to write wisely and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires cooperation and encourages students to continue learning far outside the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is characterized by a number of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north, the pristine natural beauty spreads out in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more distinguish Ontario as what outsiders consider typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the USA than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belonging to France and known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be consistent when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences or not; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole spectrum of tinnef, but that's all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to gauge the state of fighting going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, nowadays it is an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops on Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entrance fees.
It may also be worth buying a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake for the territory of Hong Kong and is the focus for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on newly reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists have made their own. If you're looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretch over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests aren't just mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart throughout the day from the inter-district bus station (across the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are cozy and stable.x
Shared taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will then be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group that inhabited present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Greater Province of the West Indies, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having its polo team and players among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on Las Cañitas polo fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be watched here at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and points of sale for polo match tickets can be found at the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also widely accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the remote islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the instructions of the park authority, visitors should stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, moose, bears and virtually all large animals can seem, they can still go on the attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them ample space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife. So avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented foods and make sure you keep it clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 50s of the 18th century and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of an inglorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships except one British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are plenty of beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe swimming facilities and most offer shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, with a lovely shopping promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
The local tap water can be safely drunk, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
"For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is alien. A small black one is "espresso", cappuccino is topped up with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices, while expensive, are excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish occur near the beach and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They may occasionally occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as tent sites, through a travel agency.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visas).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp locally, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to go early to get a campsite close to the music.
Keep in mind that parts of the festival continue to play music late into the night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking through ice causes quite terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time to stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to keep guests on site for as long as possible and to let them spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players understand the importance of staying sober.
If you want to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be affected by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari commonly refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events are held elsewhere throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies didn't apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled due to the coronavirus.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothing can help dry. Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards, even if you are not present in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try to use a hair dryer if one is available.
Take care that the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods for purifying water. Some of these prove to be more effective in counteracting certain dangers.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies widely, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Vermin can destroy food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are usually not classified as vermin.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods that are exempt from duties and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is arguably the biggest driving challenge, as it often passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay careful: steep gradients, narrow roads and sharp curves predominate here.
The stated speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cellular coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the track, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as well as in the southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit biscuits are widely available, with apples being cooked into pastries all year round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, then try what is called Berliner, pancakes or doughnuts, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "moist" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attributes, the term usually refers to the food originally sourced from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply spiced dishes. As flavor carriers, the Javanese prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a number of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets caught with his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along when the horse goes through. In order to keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup strap to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and ski down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski bums", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring with backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski touring.
It is similar to alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are carried out in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than hiking – only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for visas several times and go through several passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen area functions a bit like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as "antique" even though they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also important to many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi have bred reindeer on a large scale, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like. Reindeer kept them mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term 'gypsy' is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma."
If a travel advice is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of governments other than yours. However, their information is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of them, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water hoses and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly warned to watch out for any type of severe weather that affects their area, as it can affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
"An Internet search for "course on hostile environments" will likely show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually combined with hands-on experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role plays, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents also varies widely.
Searches at security checks have also become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact as they pass through the scanners.
Crack currents are the return stream of waves broken on the beach, often on reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast current up to deep water can form there.
Most deaths occur due to fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which can prove impossible.
When you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere where you won't get caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and depending on whether you have been noticed, you may want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travellers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to another culture and have abandoned some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew travelers would have to adapt in a new country.
You may not expect patience and understanding to be required for returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and while it's quiet before the show starts.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors all the time. The story of sounds and light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, illuminating the different pyramids.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau here and then rise again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak at 4892 m is Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and in the clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require remote data and voice connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is to study and study abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year abroad program can actually improve your chances of getting a university education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for each yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland, one in six or eighth owns a boat.
Although this is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, it is otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty).
Most pure Baltic cruises include an extended stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning in the evening and spending the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore in the course of the on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises offer Berlin in Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: this is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help some overcome the fear associated with the unknown or feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Time is often a very important factor in company documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies difficulties have arisen.
When they shipped things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to spend a big chunk of money on the privilege (or, even better, get your own company to cover the costs).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in even looking for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of planes who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably and charge prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova have been restored.
The main religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The former ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, progressive and bustling business center, located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-enclosed buildings, and modern shopping malls are characterized by classic red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, though the city exudes an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above some graves.
It is worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also in the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (Sanctuary) – a place world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave site as well as a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not spoil the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often an inaccurate cliché, the best way to find your way around Paris is to show your best side and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved). This will make it much easier to cope.
The harsh exterior of Parisians disappears very quickly if you show basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and capercaillie as well as many generally more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach above the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Although most monasteries have wrap skirts for women who come unprepared, if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach above the knees.
Again, these can be borrowed from stock at the entrance, but clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is one size fits all for all men!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredient currently available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence, in addition to the word you for "you"."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a tunword or property word is used as the noun.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the subsequent vowel.
"Also, be sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means 'dear', whereas carro means 'chariot'."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand its formulations better.
Of course, if you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or places of education.
Since light pollution during its peak was not the problem it is today, they are usually located in cities or university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in more recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are massive facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Looking at cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even 'just one'" specimen."
If you visit a formally landscaped garden and collect "samples", you will also be thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to find your way around and buy almost anything upon arrival.
Since you're in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle visits in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries all over the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter Vigil awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening, during Easter weekend, with congregational celebrations often beginning at midnight celebrating Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or washing ashore.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are common business attire and colleagues address each other with their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual achievement.
Often, employees are required to obtain approval from their supervisors for all decisions they make, and are expected to follow the instructions of their bosses unconditionally.
