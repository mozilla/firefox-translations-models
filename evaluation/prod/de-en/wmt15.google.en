The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India&#39;s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is meeting his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in Toko to discuss economic and security relations on his first important foreign visit since winning the May elections.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world&#39;s third largest economy.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defense cooperation treaty between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Old After Speedy Motorbike Chase
A motorbike was seized after the driver drove it at 125km/h in a 70km/h zone and through bushland to evade police in Bilbara.
Traffic cops in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorbike this morning after seeing it exiting a service station on Bathdate Road at 125mph.
Police say the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on Burgess Road before turning into bushland, where officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person matching the rider&#39;s description were later seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha Police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to obey a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear in Karratha Magistrates&#39; Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women at two hotels.
George Webster, 28, had the charges read out to him at a hearing by Glasgow High Court.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland&#39;s Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was &quot;unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent.&quot;
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing for November 17 at Edinburgh High Court.
Returning to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced legislation to make union organizing a civil right.
&quot;As unions die, so do middle-class jobs,&quot; said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
So I proudly present the Employee Empowerment Act alongside civil rights icon John Lewis.
This landmark law gives workers the same legal remedies against union organization discrimination as against other forms of discrimination - putting a stop to anti-union forces.
Amending the National Labor Law Act to provide a way for workers who have been discriminated against to organize union representation to seek justice in civil court - and obtain compensation or fines - is a worthwhile and necessary initiative.
But it&#39;s certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to tie it back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labor rights.
There was a time, millions of Americans still remember, when this country mentioned democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to enact a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role workers and their unions had in the creation of a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that &quot;the rights of workers to organize and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed.&quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would see the fascism of Adolf Hitler replaced with a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that stated explicitly: &quot;The right to form associations to improve working and economic conditions securing and improving is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide convention in 1948, Roosevelt and the other drafters included a guarantee that &quot; Everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests.&quot;
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As that country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union -- and then have that union participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies -- should be protected must.
Indeed, with these rights coming under attack in America, it is very wise to revisit the American ideal that working people must have the right to unite and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to protect against discrimination in the creation of workers&#39; representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and delivered on the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all Louisiana abortion clinics to close
A US federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted implementation of a law in Louisiana that attorneys say would likely have resulted in the closure of all five of the state&#39;s abortion clinics.
The measure, signed into law by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal in June and scheduled to go into effect Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to grant a patient admission right to a hospital within a 30-mile radius to get their practice.
But the judge&#39;s decision means doctors can continue to legally perform abortions for the time being while they seek such a right.
&quot;Plaintiffs may continue to operate in accordance with the law while they seek to obtain those rights,&quot; federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
A hearing for the judge will be scheduled within a month to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospitalization rights.
&quot;Today&#39;s decision means Louisiana women are avoiding a devious law that seeks to take their health and rights away from them,&quot; said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is suing on behalf of three of the state&#39;s five clinics had to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for referral rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently ruling such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state&#39;s remaining clinics to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association are unanimous in saying that institutionalization rights place unnecessary restrictions on physicians.
Anti-abortion advocates say the measures are designed to protect women&#39;s health, although some have welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor performing abortions in Louisiana has patient referral rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, that doctor would stop performing the surgery out of fear for his safety, the group said.
Arguing against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not penalize physicians for performing abortions while their motions for patient referral rights were pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments result in higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that just 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said those living in rural and remote regions of the state had a 20 percent higher risk of death during the study than those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancers
The researchers examined the women&#39;s medical care over seven years.
dr Jordan said that a woman&#39;s age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing medical conditions, and social and economic status also affect chances of survival.
Survival rates were lowest for older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis.
Those living in rural and remote regions of the state had a 20 percent higher mortality risk than those in urban areas during the study.
Although the study didn&#39;t examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan cites late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
&quot;This disease is best treated by gynecologic oncologists, and they&#39;re mostly found in larger cities,&quot; she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to address the distance, she suggested an increase in the service of doctors flown in to allow specialists to care for women closer to home, as well as treatment programs for people outside of their area, as a possible remedy.
dr Jordan said the study found poor long-term survival in women with ovarian cancer, regardless of geographic status, and underscored the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining numbers of homeowners
The decline, combined with a sharper fall in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could see garden centers lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today&#39;s young consumers break the &quot;core age group for gardening products&quot; according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times to reach.
The report states that renters spend, on average, 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on their gardens.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular practice of paving front yards for parking and the declining size of gardens are other factors threatening the industry, which has an estimated £5 billion in sales each year.
Greater London, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent over a 6-year period, is reported to have the lowest spending on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that renting accommodation or small gardens doesn&#39;t mean people can&#39;t grow plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Gardening Advisor for the RHS said: &quot;Container gardening is very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them if they move.&quot;
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot;golden age&quot; of garden retailing due to rising homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecast an improved market situation this year due to better weather after unfavorable weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of the PTV building.
The station stopped operating for around 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#39;s residence.
About a kilometer away, armed with sticks and stones, they clashed with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif&#39;s resignation, but he refused.
The country&#39;s army is meanwhile calling for a political solution to the conflict &quot;without wasting time and without using violence&quot;.
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: &quot;The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state&quot;.
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has staged numerous coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to go to Sharif&#39;s residence.
Three people were killed in the process.
Türkiye orders US diplomat over espionage report
Turkey&#39;s Foreign Ministry has summoned the country&#39;s senior US diplomat to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US embassy chargé d&#39;affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed Turkey was a key area of activity for US and British intelligence agencies.
According to Turkish news outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany&#39;s top secret service was also targeting Ankara drew much more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Train drivers threaten consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The strike announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. affects all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the Union of German Locomotive Drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant losses.
There are no regional focuses.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where it intends to strike, so it is difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Mallorca Prosecutor&#39;s Office on Friday.
The chief of police from Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was remanded in custody after corruption allegations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf&#39;s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to online daily Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to Mallorca&#39;s anti-corruption prosecutor&#39;s office on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spain&#39;s national daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners said the authorities&#39; nepotism was having a serious impact on their businesses.
&quot;It&#39;s no longer about making money, it&#39;s about surviving,&quot; one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood at stake.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer for a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a drinking spree.
Island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behavior of drunk holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of people taking part in the infamous drunken pub crawls.
The Playhouse club where the fellatio incident took place has been forced to close for a year while Playhouse and pub crawl organizer Carnage have to pay a combined fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
Popular with young British holidaymakers, the tourist resort of Magaluf is also known for a number of drink-related accidents, including the trend of &#39;balconing&#39;, where people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
SPRING has brought a wintry surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and high winds affecting flights out of Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm which had already fallen on Sunday night.
The latest rainfall was the result of a series of short, torrential showers, including a downpour that started just before 8pm and brought almost 4mm of rain in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city dropped back to a high of just 15.8C on Monday.
Gusty weather conditions are likely to have caused a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide to land late.
The aircraft was due to land just after 7:30 p.m. but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to go around.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to go around on a second landing approach and finally touched down at around 20:40.
The flight delay subsequently caused several other flights to be delayed, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16°C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for a big network
As technology gallops and threatens to turn our cozy homes into high-tech hubs, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with an eminently familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the coiled cable that connects the handset to the phone and I think: Wow, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: If it weren&#39;t for the cable, all the headphones would be flying around the house in a very short time, and that would be even more retro.
In any case, on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector bought the rule that today&#39;s world novelty is tomorrow&#39;s electronic waste - obsolete.
And if you still have a tube TV in your living room, for example, you are simply saying that you fundamentally reject television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressing of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence when it comes to electronics.
The layman who used to be able to blindly control the washing machine and CD player today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are laid out in front of him with incredibly vain expert talk: &quot;Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies&quot; promises us the press office.
Yes, are you still okay?
What should you talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, the main thing has been that we should kindly network our house.
So that the yoghurt can be reordered itself, so that the fire alarm on vacation in the Maldives tells us that there is a fire in the study.
And wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if we could turn off the air conditioning from the office to our upcoming arrival...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will definitely come true soon: We lift our watch and tell it loudly &quot;suck!&quot; - and at home the vacuum cleaning robot drives off.
Crazy.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: &quot;The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring,&quot; whispers an industry insider, you can connect the washing machine to headphones, the steam cooker sends the weather report and data glasses show how long the pizza has been in the kitchen oven still needs, which is of no use because we are stuck in traffic.
We also know from daily practice that if a newfangled device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the telephone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters as rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the Schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from fighting.
The start of schools brought a sense of joy and anticipation to rocket-hit communities in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the &quot;Pashosh&quot; kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding partitions before the students arrived.
&quot;We&#39;re a little scared but excited,&quot; said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children in our area are in dire need of a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt &quot;a little weird&quot; suddenly going back to school.
&quot;Those were difficult times and we didn&#39;t leave the house at all,&quot; she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or fled their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and avoid rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were placed in other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town badly scarred by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said &quot;we will ensure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security.&quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The truce brought an immediate end to the fighting; however, important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas&#39; demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza&#39;s air and sea ports.
Israel is demanding that Hamas disarm and hand over the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, but did not provide any concrete evidence to support this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country, during the fighting.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other strikes.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and some 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which have been converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fighting continues, education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
&quot;I hope the school will reopen soon so that we can continue learning, like the children of the world and the Jewish children,&quot; said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City .
After the election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
In view of the NPD&#39;s loss of votes in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl has spoken out in favor of an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Vice Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
&quot;The NPD is doing worse than last time,&quot; said Strobl, who is also CDU state leader in Baden-Württemberg, of the &quot;Leipziger Volkszeitung&quot;.
This is a positive development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the constitutional court.
The NPD narrowly missed the five percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003 because the Office for the Protection of the Constitution had informants at the top of the NPD at the time.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application to Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being accommodated in tents at Neuländer Platz.
The central initial reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the interior authorities have set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly beforehand - they are not very enthusiastic.
&quot;These rush actions continue to stir up reservations among citizens and give district politicians no opportunity to play a constructive role in the humane accommodation of refugees,&quot; says Britta Herrmann, group leader of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party is demanding that the Harburg district administration make unused houses available for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of people seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in the follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen their sharpest winter hike in seven years, a widely watched index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data showed Monday.
This increase brings the total increase in June, July and August to 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months ended August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data&#39;s research director, Tim Lawless, shared that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a dual market.
Figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1 percent last year compared to 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices rose just 1.4 percent for the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the onset of spring there will now be a surge in properties for sale over the next few months which will put the market to &quot;a real test&quot;.
&quot;Given the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the persistently low interest rate environment, it&#39;s likely that home prices will continue to rise over the next three months,&quot; he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements made by managing director Peer Medau and attests that he is posing &quot;like a commander&quot;.
According to the statement, this is not the style of the university.
The Medau family had already been informed verbally in mid-June about the university&#39;s request.
The statement that the plans only became known in July is definitely wrong,&quot; said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not &quot;predeterminations or even decisions&quot;, but that there are &quot;preferences&quot;.
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is said to be less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was and is no talk of a nine meter wide street.
According to the current status, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before,&quot; explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future.
There is no parking at all because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Think of the local residents
According to the university president, the Bergwichtel crèche, which is located on the premises and in front of whose front door the access to the parking deck would lead along, &quot;should not be impaired&quot;.
Rather, he points out &quot;that this is not just about the crèche, but also about the residents at the junction with Friedrich-Streib-Strasse and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
So it&#39;s about much more than the particular interests of the Medau gentlemen,&quot; said Pötzl.
&quot;The reader can decide for himself whether the criticism of the parents&#39; council of the crèche that the expansion of the road would mean that one of &quot;the few unspoilt spots in Coburg would be lost&quot; is justified.
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, wants to inform the city council about the structural development of the university up to 2020 &quot;and in this context address the importance of the new development&quot;.
Peer Medau informed the parents of the crèche about the university&#39;s plans last week.
According to this, the access to the new parking deck should not lead over the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Strasse as before, but over the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be widened to two lanes over a distance of about one kilometer.
According to projections by the Medaus, traffic in the park at Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of around 2000 vehicles a day.
The city has so far declined to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it matured over several months.
It&#39;s time for me to listen to my body and end my career in the national team,&quot; the 2007 world champion said on his Facebook page.
He is therefore retiring internationally with a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the throwing backcourt player for the champions league winner from Flensburg wants to continue chasing goals for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a &quot;long and good conversation&quot; with the Icelander, who will announce his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
I was just as enthusiastic about his ideas and approaches as they will be to inspire my long-time teammates and my successors.
But I want to be healthy for my club in the years to come, which means longer breaks for regeneration are necessary, which the current double burden doesn&#39;t allow.
The left-hander even had to fear the end of his career in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors from the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career leave no body untouched.
I have some health issues that I can no longer ignore.
After three foot surgeries for infection, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
Added to this are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year I noticed that I can control my head, but I can&#39;t fool my body,&quot; Glandorf explained in an interview with Handball Time magazine.
He would only be available for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
&quot;If all else fails, I&#39;m always ready to talk,&quot; explained the father of two to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the number of years that I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I&#39;ve also become quite humbled about my health.
After my career I would like to be able to walk at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the World Championship title in 2007 and winning the Champions League in 2014, he also won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup Winners&#39; Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the world slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
From April to the end of June 2014, gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone stimulated the economy in the spring, while investments declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, the GDP for the first half of the year increased by 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and destination of the &quot;Münsterland-Mooiste&quot;, which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch &quot;Fietzenfahrer&quot; on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called &quot;Münsterlande-Mooiste&quot;.
This is the largest cycle tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist&#39;s paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Joster Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland by registering.
Advertised in various trade journals, this tour was offered to interested parties.
We are from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland better in this way,&quot; said the cyclists, who were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering in the clubhouse of the Sta.
Katharina went on a small &quot;peace ride&quot; through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters in altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters in altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters in altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went smoothly and there were no negative incidents,&quot; says Heinz Lölfing, summing up the event positively.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecast and the rain in the morning.
&quot;We&#39;ll see each other again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend&quot;, the cyclists promised to come back to the Münsterland anyway and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker&#39;s unsparingly honest memoirs
What Konstantin Wecker, singer-songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, wrote on 287 pages in &quot;Monk and Warrior&quot; is actually more philosophical testimony than biography.
Born in Munich on June 1, 1947, he wrote his memoirs not chronologically, but more scraps of thoughts for scraps of thoughts, each chapter introduced by a suitable song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From masturbation as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves out no human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Abstract, but all the more important terms also take up a lot of space: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - he tries to get to the bottom of all this in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only music has shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought the bon vivant Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk who is created &quot;by subtraction&quot;, as he says, &quot;by leaving out everything that is unnecessary&quot;.
Between all the high-spirited views, there are also short, down-to-earth anecdotes: for example, about fights in a bar frequented by GIs or a crazy drive in which he aimed head-on at a tree.
Even then, he&#39;s ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said &quot;I love you&quot;
Henry was one of seven children in a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy&#39;s Rare Records, based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father, which grew out of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended &quot;a lot&quot; of therapy after his mother&#39;s death, and Henry is reflective of his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: &quot;Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown when I was a kid - would take him to the pub and talk about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life he was that serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and although the conditions are better than in his father&#39;s day he gained a glimpse of what life might have been like for him.
It&#39;s a bit lighter now, but they&#39;re dark, smoky, deep Stygian labyrinths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.
My dad used to just lie in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry off himself.
Walking around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without any expressions of affection from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said &quot;I love you&quot;.
It wasn&#39;t until my mother started to feel bad towards the end of her life that we started saying &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you&quot;.
Through his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he missed as a child.
Could you stop saying &quot;I love you&quot;?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I&#39;m 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn&#39;t we be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom.
It is still friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn&#39;t we be friends?
She&#39;s a great mom.
Henry&#39;s own mother was diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I got very, very overweight and started showing symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, &quot;You have to be radical.
So I did this fitness thing and also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It&#39;s very hard.
And it&#39;s exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry&#39;s career transition is perhaps reflected in his sleek, close-cropped beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been absorbed by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It&#39;s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.
He started when he was just 16, working in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage impersonating people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. &quot;I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV for quite a long time.&quot;
He learned on the job.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public eye, I also had to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine from 1975 to 1985 while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny at New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people &quot;painted themselves black,&quot; Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I have no regrets that I did.
It was an odd, awkward position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with large audiences.
But this &quot;year-long award-winning light pillar of British television&quot; was also a &quot;grotesque parody of black people.&quot;
Introducing characters who both satirized and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The front row of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he starred as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef! known.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv he thought to himself, &quot;What are you going to do next Len, because it all feels like you&#39;re just passing the time around or tread a little on the spot.&quot;
This was followed by a documentary series for Radio 4 called What&#39;s So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and mostly thought of him as a middle-class domain, white people in tights and a head of cabbage in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said &quot;You should try it.
Don&#39;t put it down if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth and you&#39;ll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello&#39;s final speech for the documentary and he was hooked.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally planted their head properly on me.
&quot;That&#39;s the point, it&#39;s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal and I read this play for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash and it just didn&#39;t happen.
And soon he appeared in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theater and I couldn&#39;t believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, &quot;Oh, you&#39;ve changed.&quot;
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he had to entertain the audience.
&quot;A little voice said to me, &#39;You&#39;ve got to get by for 10 minutes while they fix the computer.&#39;&quot;
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said &quot;oh thank god&quot;.
I am not responsible.
I can leave that to someone else.
&quot;You&#39;re in a play, so stay in character.&quot;
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was also well received, so it&#39;s like a big shield from the gods telling me, &quot;This is your destiny.&quot;
He says this, of course, in a THUNDERING voice.
So I&#39;m sticking with it.
i really love this
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry still has a comedian&#39;s mind though - our conversation is laced with outbursts of humor as he keeps impersonating characters.
I&#39;ve decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find that kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is kind of dangerous.
If you keep looking for that, you&#39;ll hit a brick wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn&#39;t give me as much as it used to.
I ask him if he&#39;ll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever want to give that up.
So is this his new incarnation?
I guess so.
I like being an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that&#39;s great.
i love stories
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen&#39;s capital
In the conflict between Shia Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sana&#39;a on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party &quot;Ansar Allah&quot; said.
The entrance to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the newspaper, Houthi threatened a further escalation of the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are demanding the government&#39;s resignation.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps along the main access roads to Sanaa.
Bloody battles with the Yemeni army keep breaking out in the surrounding area.
Kenya registers officials to curb &#39;ghost employees&#39;
Kenya has begun biometric enrollment of all state officials to remove &quot;ghost employees&quot; from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salary payments even after they have left the public service.
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013, he promised to fight corruption in the public sector.
An audit earlier this year found at least $1 million (£700,000) a month in payments to &quot;ghost employees&quot; and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officers must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure their details are taken through the biometric registrations, a government message said.
Anyone who fails to do so without a credible excuse will be removed from the payroll, the statement said.
&quot;This approach will go a long way towards streamlining the civil service by establishing the actual number of civil servants and also cleaning up the payroll at both levels of government - eliminating the &#39;ghost employees&#39;,&quot; said Anne Waiguru, cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on November 11th.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil lawsuit at the Düsseldorf district court.
A court spokeswoman said on Monday.
The lawsuit states that Achenbach cheated when buying works of art and vintage cars and charged Berthold Albrecht higher prices than actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school service for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many established Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see the human being in the student.
Sněžka is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Northern Bohemia, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, after four years of high school, he became interested in the teaching profession.
A year later the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
The family had to leave their house within half an hour.
After a few months in a camp, they went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods wagon.
So Richter ended up in Senkendorf in Upper Franconia.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers six times a week to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took his first state exam and in 1954, after three years as a candidate for teaching, he took his second state exam.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a vacancy for him as a teacher, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The &quot;Miss Room&quot; was his first &quot;service apartment&quot; in the school building.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room official apartment in the newly built teachers&#39; house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach had been closed in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association in Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today&#39;s town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid being downgraded in the now smaller school, the rector at the time, Georg Sigl, moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter&#39;s retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor at the time, Ludwig Götz, who also had a workroom built at community expense and basement rooms when the building was expanded in 1997, although this was not eligible for subsidies according to the guidelines for school buildings.
&quot;Mayor Götz was very pro-school,&quot; Richter recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten a speech by a government official who replied to a school board&#39;s presentation on law and justice: &quot;One must never forget love&quot;. Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
&quot;You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,&quot; says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn: &quot;That doesn&#39;t always work out&quot;. It is not entirely clear whether he only means his students or his own six children.
In any case, Richter&#39;s actions were unconventional at times.
When students got into fights, he didn&#39;t give them detention or sentence them to detention.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter, as rector, maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This persuaded the non-partisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last one on the CSU list.
But Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stops in the spa gardens of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists take a break in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten on their tour, that in itself is nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of people resting alone made an impression: the 700 participants in the hr4 bike tour, including the accompanying entourage, enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark in Bad Salzhausen and later an open-air party in Schotten&#39;s Alteburgpark.
Under the motto &quot;Cycling and partying on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig&quot;, the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and experienced a concert by Van Baker &amp; Band there.
Things got serious on Friday: The cyclists tackled the first stage, the 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were greeted by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had also started on his bike in Bad Vilbel, and Petra Schwing-Döring, head of Bad Salzhausen&#39;s own operations.
All sorts of good things had been prepared to refresh body and soul: the country women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 trays of apple, plum, crumble and cheesecake, which the hard-working cyclists tasted wonderfully.
&quot;Only country women can bake such cakes,&quot; praised a participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased at the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnastics club.
The &quot;Duo Bravo&quot; entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and earned enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park had a relaxing effect.
One gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: &quot;He deserves it, after all he has already reattached bike chains that have come off today&quot;.
Meanwhile, the mayor and the operations manager still had to work: They were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the fountain in front of the drinking spa and used the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotion boss Tobias Hagen, who has been the tour guide since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was only able to catch his breath for a moment, as he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he used three phones and a two-way radio to communicate with his employees and the 15-strong motorcycle squadron of the Hessian police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
&quot;The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area,&quot; he said, &quot;but cyclists also came from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they set off again after an hour and a half: &quot;Bye!&quot;
&quot;It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!&quot; they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) in Scotland, the park was given a nice festive ambience and of course delicacies, such as tarte flambée with well-chilled Federweißer, were prepared.
Mayoress Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the &quot;many activities in Scotland&quot;.
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporting activity on the bike, the opportunity for lively movement in the open air was eagerly used.
Increasing numbers of citizens mingled with the guests, who were just as impressed by the good atmosphere as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations of Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for &quot;conspiracy&quot; against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of &quot;anti-government conspiracy&quot;, local media agencies report.
Police authorities gave no immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations into government officials, including four government ministers, last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized crime group and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described their actions as part of activities spearheaded by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, principal of the Slavyansk school attended by Yatsenyuk&#39;s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
The first day of school of the new school year is traditionally celebrated with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She arrives with a proud train of glory from the world of banking, media management and the Tory party inner circle.
And she has her own front-line experience.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co., before moving on to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearsons media world.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top post at parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Her severance pay was reportedly close to £1million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
As early as May I described the task of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox to its structure.
The trust works in two directions: inwards in the top tier of the BBC&#39;s own management hierarchy, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly calling for full sweeping reform.
But what incoming chairman would risk stepping in, lashing out and tearing apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps losing his job in the process.
It&#39;s a difficult task.
And as if that weren&#39;t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC scaled down - power, money and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technology threatens old, comfortable securities, the BBC&#39;s forthcoming royalty negotiation poses particular perils.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into what is arguably the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs just 40p a day each.
And the BBC seems to be climbing the popularity charts again: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC&#39;s viewing and usage habits have changed: I now get news headlines on my phone and watch programs I&#39;ve missed later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a much-loved and respectable institution.
She needs a formidable chairman - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says derogatory tweet was unauthorized
A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry&#39;s official user account on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney who is the focus of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another one from Perry&#39;s user account, which denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
&quot;I don&#39;t approve of the tweet and have deleted it,&quot; the later message said.
Perry employees did not promptly respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets originated from Perry&#39;s official user account, it was not clear who is actually serving the feed.
The earlier tweet painted an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a grant to her office when she refused to step down, leading to an indictment of Perry - who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet reads, &quot;I don&#39;t always drive drunk to three times the legal limit...but when I do, I&#39;ll impeach Governor Perry if he spills it.&quot;
I&#39;m the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg&#39;s office was not charged with directing the grand jury&#39;s investigation into Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry has pleaded not guilty, calling the charges a political ploy.
His top-class team of legal counsel moved the case judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that the statute targeting the longest-serving governor in Texas state history is unconstitutionally vague.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in federal funding to the state&#39;s Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and investigates Texas state corruption - when Lehmberg refused to step down.
This veto prompted a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry&#39;s official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential bid, Perry addressed speculation that he was quitting by tweeting a photo of himself jogging near a lake with the words &quot;South Carolina , we come!&quot;
Berkeley declares housing market &quot;normal&quot; again
One of London&#39;s most prominent property developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had &quot;returned&quot; to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were in high demand and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to impose a mortgage lending ceiling in June amid widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive officer of top-tier construction firm Berkeley said Monday, &quot;Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak,&quot; adding that this provides a &quot;steady operating environment.&quot;
The London property market has held up well during the downturn as foreign buyers flock to the capital.
According to the Land Registry, prices in the metropolitan area have jumped by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, well above the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices across Berkeley&#39;s residential, budget and student offerings have risen by about a fifth over the past year and were around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of whom have also been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric surrounding a possible &quot;mansion tax&quot; ahead of next May&#39;s general election.
London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that April&#39;s mortgage market report, which unveiled tougher lending regulations, would also mean slower market growth in both house sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in mortgage approvals in July, also suggesting the housing market is slowing.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for London house price growth down to 3 percent for 2015 on the basis of already flagging house price awareness.
Transaction volume in London&#39;s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire to own a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, with amounts due for futures sales approaching more than £2.2bn.
Mr Pidgley added: &quot;Demand for the right, well planned product in the best locations has remained stable and as a result forward sales have also remained stable.&quot;
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year ended April -- almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax profit rose 40 per cent annually to £280m, while turnover rose 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
In a statement Monday ahead of the company&#39;s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that year-to-date earnings for Berkeley are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts unanimously put annual pre-tax profit at £450m.
Berkeley shares were firm at £23.96 in London afternoon trading.
Jennifer Lawrence nude photos leaked online by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence performing at the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a &quot;master list&quot; of images from 100 other starlets.
A rep for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence&#39;s photos were real and accused the hacker of &quot;blatant invasion of privacy.&quot;
Authorities have been notified and will pursue anyone who reposts Jennifer Lawrence&#39;s stolen photos.
The photos, originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a hole in Apple&#39;s iCloud online storage system. The alleged &quot;master list&quot; of hacked victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It&#39;s not certain how many of the images are real, although &#39;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&#39; star Winstead also took to Twitter to condemn the hack.
&quot;To those of you who are looking at photos my husband and I took in the privacy of our home years ago - I hope you are really happy with yourselves,&quot; Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon series &#39;iCarly&#39; and &#39;Victorious&#39; denied that the photos were of her and tweeted, &quot;These so called nude pics of me are FAKE guys.
Let&#39;s fight back at the beginning. *pun intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a rep for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson&#39;s critically acclaimed new novel about love and the letter &quot;J&quot;.
They melted, that&#39;s the best way to describe it, slowly dissolving like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Occasionally a woman would tell him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant and maybe a bit scratchy.
And then shook his hand.
Scratchy he knew.
He was prickly, like in hedgehogs, yes.
The latest victim of this prickling was an affair in the early stages that had held more promise than usual for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life, and might even have brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a quiveringly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a North Island village even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an elderly companion who Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited property in a damp but heavenly valley aptly named Paradise Valley.
Nobody had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the bathrooms, slugs had left their tracks on all the windows and thought they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.
It was like the house from a children&#39;s fairy tale, both menacing and alluring, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &quot;J&quot; was longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting in the broken deck chairs in the long grass, holding hands with Ailinn, enjoying an unseasonably warm spring afternoon. Both had been absentmindedly tapping into the duty console that was feeding the country with soothing music and soothing messages, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father liked to listen to with the shutters closed around the house .
your feet are too big
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, like the word obsolete.
Popular taste did what edicts and regulations never could, and just as people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks, and romances in books, so in music they chose ballads.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing about Ailinn&#39;s big feet in a hilarious serenade.
Ailinn didn&#39;t understand.
&quot;It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,&quot; he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That&#39;s what his father used to do to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn&#39;t been a very fun game even then, and it wasn&#39;t very fun now either.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz wasn&#39;t played, even if it wasn&#39;t outright forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for one &quot;if&quot; in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be absolutely sure where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he&#39;d lived to 10 without hearing of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father&#39;s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn&#39;t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn&#39;t remember a time when pop singers weren&#39;t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of that society gratefully consented to the principle of group endowment - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were temperamentally and physically suited to entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Humans originally from the Indian subcontinent were naturally gifted with electronic talent and charged with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those in the Gulf and Levant whose grandparents hadn&#39;t left the country sooner than WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED - for fear of being charged with stoking, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had Opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, considered themselves self-conscious and became depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Having only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to see how the insulting words Kevern had just sung her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
&quot;They&#39;re not really offensive,&quot; said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My dad never offended anyone but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn&#39;t understand.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He started to say it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers to his lips again in front of her.
She already thought he was a bit odd.
&quot;It seemed funny to him,&quot; he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern&#39;s view.
There was nothing in all the world to see but her uncombed raven hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
&quot;If you say so,&quot; she said without conviction.
But that still doesn&#39;t explain why you&#39;re singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet not so directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me &#39;cause my ankles are too big?
hate you
Of course I don&#39;t hate you.
That&#39;s just the stupid song.
He could have said &quot;I love you&quot;, but it was too early for that.
&quot;Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you,&quot; he tried instead.
I&#39;m a bit perverted.
That didn&#39;t sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
He often got himself into trouble when he tried to be funny because, like his father, he didn&#39;t have the calming charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe that&#39;s what he, Kevern, wanted to be.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her lounge chair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they had been drinking.
Elderflower wine, so drunk was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm fronds in a storm.
&quot;And your stubbornness is exactly why I&#39;m perversely attracted to you,&quot; she said...
Except I&#39;m not.
He felt sorry for her, both for the needless rudeness of his words and for the fear that showed in her eyes as she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She hadn&#39;t told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she&#39;d grown up, but he had no doubt it was essentially like this.
The same vast and frigid ocean broke here and there on the shore.
The same bewildered men, even thicker-skinned and more morose after WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their smuggler and beachcomber ancestors had been, roamed from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand at any woman who refused or laughed at them .
stubborn?
They would have given her a big fist if she wasn&#39;t careful!
Smooch her first - smooch was the word most commonly used for erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the bland love ballads of the console - smooch her first and then spank.
In Kevern&#39;s view, that was an unnecessary refinement, since the snogging was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gestured through her body for him to leave.
He rose from the lounge chair like an old man.
She felt leaden, too, but the depth of his grief surprised her.
This wasn&#39;t the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him walk away - the way her companion watched him from an upstairs room - a man weighed down by something he had conjured up himself.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back arched, embarrassed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well when she couldn&#39;t remember a single time she had seen it seen today?
Alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked down at her feet.
Several years before the events just recounted, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public sentiment watchdog, was working on a brief presentation on the continuing low- and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country where their reduction, if not elimination, would be most likely, given the funds and energy that had been invested in eradicating that violence.
&quot;Much has been done, and much remains to be done,&quot; she wrote, &quot;to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, particularly in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically seldom been felt, despite the towering church spiers between the hedges.
But some qualities turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the steeple, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gets high on tales of difficulties overcome, and proclaims a firm belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does former brutality hold a firm grip on rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious contentiousness at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the pitch.
&quot;They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,&quot; said her mentor after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
&quot;I don&#39;t think I need to say that,&quot; Esme Nussbaum replied.
are you a lesbian
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and not to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
&quot;I&#39;m not asking that,&quot; Luther Rabinowitz finally said, &quot;because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a nonjudgmental workplace.
We serve an unprejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, while perfectly acceptable and commendable in and of themselves, can occasionally skew results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and those things you describe as &quot;sneaky&quot; and &quot;crude&quot; could just as easily be interpreted by others as expressing a natural strength and vitality.
To keep harping on WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED as if, if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday is robbing the country of its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-pink LED lettering repeated advice Ofnow had been giving to the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speech is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
&quot;I absolutely understand what you&#39;re getting at,&quot; Esme Nussbaum replied evenly when she was sure her superior had finished speaking, &quot;and all I&#39;m saying is that we&#39;re not as effectively healed as we are fool ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT HAPPENED in the first place, WHEN IT HAPPENED.
But this time, it&#39;s not the others on whom we vent our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate the patience of an angel.
&quot;You&#39;re going too far,&quot; he said, &quot;in labeling &#39;mistakes&#39; actions that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you say that they took out their &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;distrust&quot; on &quot;others&quot;.
It shouldn&#39;t really be necessary to remind anyone in your position that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, we are not talking about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;others.&quot;
There was no &quot;we&quot; and there was no &quot;other&quot;.
It was a time of disorder, that&#39;s all we know.
&quot;Which, if we&#39;re honest with ourselves,&quot; ventured Esme to interject, &quot;no section of society can claim to have behaved well.
I don&#39;t accuse anyone.
Whether done badly or well, what is done is done.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no debt needs to be assigned, so no debt needs to be canceled if such cancellation were appropriate and if there were a way to cancel it.
But what good is the past if we don&#39;t learn from it -
The past is for us to forget.
If I may say something about that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
&quot;I&#39;ll consider your report,&quot; he said, dismissing her.
The next day, while walking to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, passers-by described, had pulled onto the footpath in a kind of &quot;brutal rage&quot;.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho have denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they are targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country&#39;s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup but that the military was responding to threats from &quot;political fanatics&quot; who the police were about to arm.
&quot;What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defense Forces staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were elements within the police force who were actually planning to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to wreak havoc wreak havoc,&quot; he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup.
&quot;Although no one has claimed to have taken over the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho&#39;s defense forces so far show signs of a coup,&quot; he said.
Lesotho military spokesman said on Sunday that the soldiers were withdrawing to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will assume leadership of the government in Thabane&#39;s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has been targeted for trying to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions amid disagreements in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite allegations to the contrary.
Eurozone manufacturing at a 13-month low
Manufacturing growth in the euro zone slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, according to a closely monitored study.
The final Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers&#39; Index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders fell and factories slumped at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets are awaiting a clear plan from the bank to deal with a faltering recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi could give more details later this week on whether he is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, along the lines of those undertaken by the UK and US during the financial crisis.
&quot;Although little growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of mounting economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more apparent,&quot; said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia&#39;s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc&#39;s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a problem child, as does Italy&#39;s descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism of Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer working is also not reassuring,&quot; said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in the industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The best that can be said for the August Eurozone manufacturing PMI is that the sector continues to grow thereafter.&quot;
He added: &quot;Eurozone producers are evidently finding life quite difficult at the moment as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - are adding to uncertainties in the ongoing difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened uncertainty has clearly affected the economy - particularly, and consumer confidence, and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said it was &quot;increasingly likely&quot; that the ECB would eventually have to embark on some form of QE, &quot;although we suspect this will be limited.&quot;
The Decade of Hell of the Beslan Survivors: Ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school, and the children involved in it still suffer to this day.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the horrifying Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night&#39;s heroic survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in revulsion, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst of misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who overcame adversity, although the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
your best hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the bulletproof school gymnasium
Photographed by celebrity Russian photographer Dmitri Beliakov, she became famous wearing nothing but her underwear trying to climb back into the bullet-riddled school gymnasium after a mine went off.
Completely confused, Aida looked for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were presumed dead, but they survived.
&quot;A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely cured, but said yesterday: &quot;Three months ago the pain came back.
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to have another operation.
Some shrapnel is still stuck in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
&quot;This tragedy changed my life, but it didn&#39;t break me,&quot; she says combatively.
&quot;It happened to me and you can&#39;t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
&quot;I don&#39;t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I&#39;ll think of a family later.
She says the siege will always be a part of her, although the memory fades a little each year.
I&#39;m glad so many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we&#39;ve received from people in the UK and from across the world.
When I see the photo online of me climbing back to school, I think many people will see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help ensure something like this doesn&#39;t happen again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, &quot;Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.&quot;
After an explosion he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, &quot;Run.&quot;
Fearing that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed her hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, hugging his son outside, said: &quot;Damir told me his mother had died.
He said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t save her.&quot;
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and been hospitalized with leg injuries, believing her son had died.
After their reunion, she said: &quot;I cried with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo&#39;s Children&#39;s Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
&quot;This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,&quot; he said yesterday.
But I can say that my memory is fading.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and it&#39;s not a problem for me.
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don&#39;t think about myself.
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard who couldn&#39;t make it outside.
We never say they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop where I could pick and choose whatever I wanted and the ride in an open top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamities he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day but I wish I could stop remembering it.
&quot;I feel so sorry for all those who are suffering the atrocities,&quot; said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I want so much to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: &quot;37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how it helped Damir and I.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot them with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: &quot;I always think this world hasn&#39;t gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war is going on now and people are dying every day and I believe many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are children just like ours.
I think for many the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can&#39;t stop feeling this.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it&#39;s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn&#39;t like remembering this, but he has six close friends from his class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles.
When he was younger he suffered from it - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, facing away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other military toys. Damir is 17 now, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can&#39;t believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the blast and got to my feet, I looked around and saw hell all around me with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy could not possibly have survived in this hell.
&quot;I remember shouting to him, &#39;Damir, run, run away&#39;, but I was also so sure that he hadn&#39;t heard me.
But he heard and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life goes on for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image became a symbol of the atrocities of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodied face was scarred with fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
&quot;I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy was left there alone for three horrible days,&quot; she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer that date gets, the harder it is to think about and talk about.
There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don&#39;t think it&#39;s long ago, I mean it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days haunt me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgy really wanted to go to school that day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn&#39;t know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of weeping George in San Marino.
Georgy doesn&#39;t like looking at the picture and it&#39;s hidden on the bookshelf at home.
I understand that, but I also think that thanks to this picture, people around the world feel our pain.
Georgij says today: &quot;It is important that something like this can never happen again.
&quot;I doubt we&#39;ll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they&#39;re investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is turning into something terrible.
&quot;I can&#39;t understand how that&#39;s possible because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It took a toll on my health and I still feel it.
I had a few nightmares about the siege for about three or four years, but then things got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That&#39;s why I always go to the gym when September 1st approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It&#39;s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don&#39;t feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won&#39;t forget it, but I don&#39;t feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on
I graduated from school this year and I&#39;m going to a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was army training.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn&#39;t allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that&#39;s not going to happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gymnasium, sitting next to the bomb attached to a murderous terrorist&#39;s foot.
It really is a miracle he wasn&#39;t killed.
&quot;We feel like it was yesterday,&quot; says Georgy, who wanted to join the FSB as an intelligence officer but was unable to because of his health problems from the siege.
It&#39;s still with me, it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve left behind.
I&#39;m older now and people say that children deal easily with bad experiences - I have to say that&#39;s not true.
&quot;In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better afterwards, but I can&#39;t forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please don&#39;t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgiy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on his laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don&#39;t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I&#39;m fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I&#39;ve already had two years there.
He learns the treatment of all animals &quot;from cats to cows&quot;.
He said: &quot;I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children shouldn&#39;t know about it and of course they shouldn&#39;t suffer from it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said: &quot;This pain never leaves me.
It&#39;s in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the commemoration celebrations.
I know that Georgij will not go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn&#39;t.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn&#39;t help.
I am so thankful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan everyone is marked by it.
It stays with us.
Georgy is an adult now, but that horror is still in him.
It&#39;s hard to accept when something so unfair happens to you.
He&#39;s a boy, he likes sports but he can&#39;t participate because of his knee.
He has had multiple surgeries, he can walk but does not exercise.
I&#39;d say he&#39;s 50% over the horror, but you can never completely get over it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and it only adds to my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me and that is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for those who died.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It&#39;s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don&#39;t want it to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what&#39;s going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how come we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special task force
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is brought to safety by a Russian special task force (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory of the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when baby Aliona was carried out of the Beslan siege in the arms of a Russian police officer.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty restrained her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aliona&#39;s mother and sister perished in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a baby girl with his new wife, Svetlana, whom he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, now ten years old, has no memory of the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
&quot;They are one big happy family now and Aliona and Makhar are both great kids,&quot; says a close friend.
Ruslan is an amazing father and wants to spare them all the memories that come with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of running over girl on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for running over a three-year-old girl at a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the Pittenween crossing in East Neuk.
The indictment alleges that Mr Steward drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the allegation in Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC scheduled the trial for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you are keen on taking photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which can be had for around $300.
I took these photos at a family reunion using multiple cameras, all available for under $350.
Regardless of the gear, there are a few rules for best results.
Double check your gear.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are closed tightly.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and capture modes that optimize exposure for the twilight underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your gear is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our digital camera buyers guide and reviews for traditional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many won&#39;t work out.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that lets you compose images, action cams typically don&#39;t.
Even if you have an LCD, it&#39;s difficult to view underwater and getting the picture right is a matter of luck.
So take lots of shots.
If your camera has a bracket mode that takes a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light degrades dramatically the farther you get from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake, or ocean.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is good advice on land too, but it&#39;s even more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose character changes things, even in an organization as massive as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthetist, he devoted his career to sparing patients both the agony of illness and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 agent who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about the diagnoses and diseases, while those treated are mostly occupied with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.
&quot;I wasn&#39;t feeling,&quot; he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently reproaching his wife Juliet.
&quot;I&#39;d rather have everything now than later,&quot; he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt uncharacteristically and unnecessarily alarmed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Just two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pleura, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all people with lung cancer have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is asbestos exposure - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a &quot;miracle material&quot; but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that we can easily ignore.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily committed to phasing it out.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another era, it hardly seems to be a concern today.
But this complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as from traffic accidents.
Annual figures for mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are seeing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that mesothelioma takes decades to develop.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to ex-construction workers.
Asbestos has been, and often still is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in and the stores we shop in.
And so mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial barriers, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from London&#39;s elegant department stores to private schools, are no shelter.
The parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals, where we are supposed to get well, the source of this deadly carcinogen has already been identified.
Andrew Lawson wasn&#39;t old.
He wasn&#39;t a plumber either.
Indeed, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
&quot;It appears there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy&#39;s Hospital, where I trained for six years.&quot; he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
&quot;Of the four doctors trained at Guy&#39;s Hospital who have developed mesothelioma in the last five years,&quot; he wrote in a 2010 letter, &quot;I am the last one alive.&quot;
How many more of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 of this year.
That was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma sufferers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So we can only repeat Lawson&#39;s question: &quot;How many of us are going to get sick?&quot;
The UK&#39;s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to end in Britain, a total of 90,000 will have died from the disease.
Most of them have no idea right now that they will die like this.

A quick look at the court files, which sufferers often turn to for compensation claims, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma has already become.
For example, in June this year, Marks &amp; Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one being the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she joined M&amp;S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
&quot;Prior to this,&quot; she says, &quot;I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn&#39;t even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word &quot;asbestiform&quot;, a description of the fibrous structure that makes the fabric strong and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered a &quot;major health risk&quot; with the potential for death by the EU and WHO.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world&#39;s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that &quot;there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high rates of mesothelioma.&quot;
A Marks &amp; Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Allen may not have viewed herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto&#39;s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of sufferers showing that &quot;a significant proportion of mesothelioma with no known exposure at work or in the home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.&quot;
Much of that contact, he says, comes from the &quot;normal use and aging&quot; of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume for sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even at the heart of government, may have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and ducts behind Parliament&#39;s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be stirred up by something as harmless as &quot;strong air currents&quot;.
Members of Parliament are often accused of looking out for their own interests, but here it seems the opposite is true.
While directorate of the Parliamentary Labor Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a &quot;clean bill of health&quot;, it is now undisputed that £1bn of work will be required over several years to refurbish Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove asbestos removed, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs are more likely to meet at the nearby QE2 conference center than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard Report also noted that &quot;the presence of asbestos was not dealt with in accordance with the relevant regulations.&quot;
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to pinpoint exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
&quot;I&#39;ve worked in a hospital where asbestos claims have been adjudicated,&quot; he says, &quot;but I can&#39;t prove it in my case.
It&#39;s so difficult to remember all the places you&#39;ve worked and the dates.
What he still remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he got some kind of fever.
He was 45 and just had an operation late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to drive home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn&#39;t go to work for a month.
Puzzled doctors took X-rays of his chest and inserted pleural catheters to draw fluid from his lungs for laboratory testing.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved and he returned to work.
However, symptoms would return from time to time, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbott&#39;s presented with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott didn&#39;t connect this to his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott&#39;s condition worsened again, and his GP took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert panel.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cavity between the pleura and pleura.
i am an optimist
Most of the time I just keep going,&quot; he says.
To be honest, I wasn&#39;t that worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year&#39;s: &quot;I was told that it was mesothelioma.&quot;
Graham Abbott: Diagnosing mesothelioma
Abbott suddenly had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended he hire a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
&quot;It turned out that asbestos was very common, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos,&quot; he says.
The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now becoming ill.
And so, mesothelioma is now hitting younger people who haven&#39;t worked in typical jobs.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were underground, so patients were less likely to be exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
It is still being removed today.
Students placed their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it&#39;s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people may have had their first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemistry classes, students have parked their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now a frequent topic on websites.
And meanwhile, innocent items in our homes like floorboards or shed roofs have contained asbestos by default.
&quot;It&#39;s an industrial toxin that&#39;s in a lot of our properties,&quot; notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his Guy&#39;s Hospital case.
In one case, the only contact an affected woman could think of was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch out as you demolish your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.
&quot;It takes a while to process that,&quot; says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn&#39;t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won&#39;t see another Christmas.
One of the greatest difficulties was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls being overwhelmed with all the information he had to contend with.
&quot;It was very difficult to record it all,&quot; he says.
&quot;I asked my doctor &#39;how long do I have?&quot;
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, &quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to see another Christmas.
That&#39;s it.&quot;&quot;
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is blown up and the fibers are inhaled, they can become lodged in the pleura, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can trigger cell mutations.
&quot;The problem arises with the needle-like asbestos fibers that are inhaled,&quot; said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic doctor who joined Guy&#39;s Hospital in 2001.
Ironically, the very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos is now a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also believed to have been exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, &quot;the breathing process pushes them to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the start.
The usual options for other cancers don&#39;t work as well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly debated.
Some think it&#39;s worth trying.
Treasure denies that.
&quot;You can&#39;t cut out the pleura,&quot; he says.
You can&#39;t get around it with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer &quot;doesn&#39;t respond very well to chemotherapy,&quot; which &quot;has an effect&quot; but doesn&#39;t cure.
&quot;Sometimes there are long-term survivors,&quot; says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Luckily, some patients are actually living long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow sufferers.
&quot;Hello, Cancer Center,&quot; he cheerfully introduced himself to calls.
&quot;He was very positive,&quot; says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally been offered six courses of chemotherapy, lasting four months and expected to add only a month to his life.
&quot;I was desperate,&quot; he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson &quot;managed to put things in a slightly more positive light.&quot;
After consulting several physicians, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Cardiothoracic Specialist at Guy&#39;s.
&quot;We had an advantage in not having to be referred, I just called and got an appointment,&quot; admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for treatment approval.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to take advantage of the best therapies available.
But when these treatments eventually inevitably fail, many sufferers are left with another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hopes of redress.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
&quot;It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely hazardous to health,&quot; says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was the recognition that even very small exposures posed a health risk.
And this is where corporate negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy&#39;s Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn&#39;t what Morgan calls &quot;full compensation&quot; because Lawson couldn&#39;t prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to exposure to asbestos at Guy&#39;s.
However, following the inquest into his death, a Guy&#39;s spokesman confirmed that &quot;the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s.&quot;
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, attributing fatal asbestos exposure to a company or workplace is an enormous problem - usually decades after the incident.
Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those defending claims know the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, this year saw significant new legislation that makes it easier for people with mesothelioma to sue for compensation even if their previous employers can no longer be found.
The law created an insurance industry-sponsored fund of £350m for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove a contact but cannot sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs get 80 per cent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages case - around £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks £350m was a &quot;very good job&quot; by the insurance industry.
&quot;It&#39;s a deal by insurers for insurers,&quot; he says, suggesting that that&#39;s a quarter of what insurers would have paid if time hadn&#39;t passed and mesothelioma sufferers found the companies and they could sue normally.
Mike Penning, then Secretary of Labor and Pensions, also admitted that the law was &quot;not perfect&quot;.
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths a day, quick action was needed.
&quot;People are suffering so much and need help today,&quot; Penning said during the second hearing on the mesothelioma bill in December last year.
At this point, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expects to have a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt empowered.
&quot;That&#39;s obviously one of the most important things,&quot; says Abbott.
You see that again and again in patients.
There&#39;s something there that keeps you going.
If you give up, you&#39;ll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he had completed the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then in March 2014 I had a scan.
There were multiple cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life threatening.
This is life ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is very tiring, both physically and mentally.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I&#39;m gone, for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news, you become negative.
You have to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it&#39;s not always easy.
&quot;It&#39;s hard for parents,&quot; he says.
It&#39;s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls I had a disease I wouldn&#39;t grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn&#39;t say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not tinged with hope, not a shred of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as eventually did Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, &quot;Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to elect government, protesters vow retaliation
On Sunday, China&#39;s parliament ruled against Hong Kong&#39;s electorate nominating candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing calls for democratic reforms.
This move is believed to fuel the long-heralded protests in Hong Kong&#39;s business district, while activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People&#39;s Congress basically allows the communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing-loyal candidates.
&quot;It&#39;s not unexpected, but it makes us angry,&quot; said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice-secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, said allowing public nominations in the elections would be too &quot;messy&quot; for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain gave control of Hong Kong back to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let residents vote for the presidency of government by 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday&#39;s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens direct voting rights, but the decision also shows that the Chinese leadership maintains a tight grip on the process through a tightly Beijing-controlled nominating committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates &quot;with love for the country and love for Hong Kong&quot; should be admitted.
The decision follows a summer that saw some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to lockdown the financial district unless Beijing allows genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong in the rain.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, organizers said the movement &quot;considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action to take place only when all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing&#39;s announcement for days, and tightened security measures including police forces and barricades were in place in front of the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong&#39;s values of democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under mounting pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement&#39;s demonstrations as threatening business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
&quot;The protests you&#39;re talking about could do major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,&quot; said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don&#39;t want to stir up fears that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China&#39;s state-controlled media also recently reported Hong Kong democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights, attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong&#39;s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region&#39;s history.
The tradition of proms in the United States is now being carried over to the universities, where freshmen performances are offered by private plane.

In order to be able to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also indicated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to haul their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
This year, along with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach university with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings as the service had just launched, but added that &quot;students would be booking the service over the next few weeks&quot;.
The company also said that despite the £9,000-a-year tuition fee, it expects there to be a market for the offering.
Students today have very different expectations and aspirations than students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - making a great first impression is more important than ever, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as aloof.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice-President for Higher Education said: &quot;This offering seems completely disconnected from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students beginning college this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis as available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships can&#39;t keep up with soaring bills for the most basic of living needs before they can even think of it, thousands of pounds on something as simple as getting into college accommodation.
Feminists criticize race and post-Ferguson policing
The unarmed teenager was killed by a Ferguson, Mo. police officer earlier this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and chanted, &quot;Hands up, don&#39;t shoot,&quot; as they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in white feminist discussions online.
In her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and garnered attention across the country, Perez saw that white women&#39;s responses were 100% about race.
Compared to the responses from black women shortly after the August 9 shooting, the personal essays with titles like &quot;Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman&quot; and &quot;Feminism Isn&#39;t Just About Women&#39;s Oppression&quot; came relatively late.
But for Perez, it marked an important change.
&quot;I don&#39;t think you find a lot of people in feminism talking about whiteness and privilege in such a high-class way,&quot; she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the incidents.
It&#39;s characteristic of the crisis we&#39;re in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized they have to express that.
For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day that are not considered &quot;women&#39;s issues&quot; in the cultural space.
&quot;I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,&quot; Mitchell said.
When I post about people of color being under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
&quot;How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship but not about public safety?&quot; she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender and sexuality throughout US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For her, black women haven&#39;t had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women are now merging issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
&quot;Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the motive was almost always the rape of a white woman,&quot; said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came at the point when white women suffrage campaigners like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 1800s and found that the suffrage struggle was for only one at a time group could be successful: women or blacks.
&quot;They made the decision to support women&#39;s suffrage, and black suffrage was to come later,&quot; Hattery said.
Remembering such things makes one realize with power why women of color don&#39;t trust white women.
We didn&#39;t do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it was another decade before white women organized against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for help, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson—police behavior, racial discrimination—reflects a time when white feminists played &quot;tag&quot; with issues Black women had grappled with for generations.
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the activists who run such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they take the right to birth control?&quot; asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now trying to understand what that means.
Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a poignant article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll calling for more protests by white Americans on the issue of racism.
&quot;I hope that women, who have a different but parallel reason for understanding an inherent danger in the body -- and opinions about race that are markedly different in public polls -- will lead the changes,&quot; Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism that addresses race as well as gender issues, some have been baffled by her comments on race in America.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; told She The People that young men in the United States, particularly young black men, &quot;are far more vulnerable than their sisters,&quot; but Steinem&#39;s comments about Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother&#39;s Keeper, to help vulnerable young Black and Hispanic men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only issue pushing mainstream feminism to the fore.
After US Border Patrol officers apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country&#39;s southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform has also resurfaced - this time as a women&#39;s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to reconsider the issue as a women&#39;s issue all she needs to do is publish the stories of immigrant women.
&quot;These speak for themselves,&quot; said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position of vulnerability to domestic violence and exploitation.
&quot;These stories resonate with women&#39;s organizations,&quot; she said.
&#39;Pig House&#39; in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it was revealed that it showed a large pig lounging in the living room.
The one bedroom detached house is on a private road in Ipswich and is being offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a depiction of the house&#39;s living room - which included a pig with its head propped on a sofa.
Estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner&#39;s pet.
&quot;However, the photo was published in error and has since been removed,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the company.
In the home&#39;s synopsis, Connells described the former meeting house as a &quot;one of a kind one bedroom family home.&quot;
Although the agent has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The home sale drew interest on social media, with some asking if the hog was included in the purchase price.
The SW town of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on the line this month
The search for a new millionaire in south-west Perth continues with one lucky winner taking home nearly $1.1 million from Saturday&#39;s lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey hit the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to announce themselves.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the win is a talking point in the small south-west Perth town.
The town is talking about nothing else and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought such a win could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated Division One wins in the past month, a fitting conclusion to a happy couple of weeks for players across the state.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of August&#39;s five millionaires after a couple from Belmont hit the mega $7.5 million win just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the opportunity to tour the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th Division 1 winner in WA this year, with nearly $85 million total.
Leonidas invited to the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the appeal of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of presentations, performances, games, exhibits and information about Roman times and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial group of fighters from the &quot;Amor Mortis&quot; gladiator school, who used every break in the rain to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner &quot;Leonidas&quot; proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and one after the other sent his men into the ring for heroic duels in different gladiator categories.
First it was the turn of the &quot;Provocators&quot; with rectangular shields and short swords as well as greaves on the left leg and bracers on the right arm.
This was followed by the &quot;Essedarii&quot; with a breastplate, short sword and throwing lance as well as an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the &quot;Retiarius&quot;, who attacked the &quot;Secutor&quot; with a net, trident and dagger and after a short fight pushed the boy to the ground.
The swords crashed into each other, the shields clattered and the throwing lances flew whirring through the arena, so that one could get scared for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing &quot;Summa Rudis&quot;, the muscular referee, always kept an attentive eye on them.
&quot;We wanted to revive everyday Roman life and make it possible to experience the culture of Roman times&quot;, explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer &quot;Freundeskreis Römerkanal&quot;, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an &quot;Oppidum Romanum&quot; for one day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his welcoming speech.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of it could also be admired at the Roman Day, such as &quot;Aqueduct Marble&quot; from the eleven meter high and 1400 meter long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society contrasted the water and energy supply then and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: &quot;Today we still benefit from the knowledge from back then&quot;.
This is also confirmed by qualified surveyor Ralph Heiliger from the &quot;IngenieurteamZwei&quot; from Rheinbach, who presented Roman surveying instruments such as chorobat, groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the warm-air heating system that once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by the wolf and fox two millennia ago in the clay footsteps before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Preservation of Archaeological Monuments at the Rhineland State Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Industrial Park in Rheinbach.
Enclosing walls of a farm building with a kiln for drying grain and malting were found.
The building probably belonged to a villa rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
Morscheiser suspects that the villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the Germans invaded the Rhineland, which was then Roman.
With her, the children also played the Roman windmill game, similar to today&#39;s mill game, or they wrote their names on wax tablets with metal pencils like the Roman schoolchildren once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay their own mosaics, at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum they could make glass mosaics and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center they could use a heavy stone wheat mill to grind the flour for flatbread or muesli.
The visitors drove through the amusement park in a faithfully reproduced Roman touring carriage drawn by two draft horses and passed the impressive stand of the Municipal High School, which was presenting the results of its &quot;Roman Project Weeks&quot;.
With a Roman week from September 13th to 21st, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman year 2014, which has been proclaimed throughout the Rhineland and is intended to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the homeland and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the Oberbachem amateur play group, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and reminders of Wachtberg’s Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionnaire will talk about his work on the drafty Wachtberg, plants will be presented as living monuments from Roman times and a funny lesson in international understanding will be offered between a group of Wachtberger &quot;Germans&quot; and Romans who have moved there.
The Adendorf elementary school is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
The aim of the Roman Week is to make it possible to experience the numerous traces of the Romans in Wachtberg, which are often no longer visible at first glance.
A small presentation in the Wachtberg town hall will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum matron sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is weighing on West Africa&#39;s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are deserted - and international companies keep their distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic deals a severe blow to West Africa&#39;s economy.
The crops are rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are deserted - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are also already distancing themselves.
&quot;The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,&quot; said Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest hit
&quot;It&#39;s a total catastrophe, we&#39;re losing a lot of money,&quot; says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia&#39;s capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people falling victim to the fever here alone.
Health officials recently said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have died and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Across the resource-rich countries, companies are suspending operations.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their home towns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, are rotting in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
&quot;People will travel less and less,&quot; says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on West Africa&#39;s economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
The markets are running out of staple foods like rice.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors could get the impression &quot;that it&#39;s dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore also to invest,&quot; warns Hugon.
The disease is also taking a toll on states&#39; strained national budgets
The disease also burdens the already strained national budgets of the affected countries.
The rating agency Moody&#39;s fears that their budgets will be severely strained by the high expenditures for the health care system and additionally by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the affected countries&#39; health systems with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed to date.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not been affected so far.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also falling significantly.
Shooters celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooting club &quot;Tannenwald&quot; Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from September 12th to 14th.
The preparations for the 50th anniversary celebration from September 12th to 14th are in full swing at the Tannenwald shooting club.
A big evening of entertainment with the group &quot;Dorfrocker&quot; is planned for Friday, September 12th.
The big firecracker is on Saturday at 6 p.m.
This is followed by a fun evening in the large marquee with the &quot;Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam&quot;.
Brass band provides the music
The highlights on Sunday are the festival service at 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big procession at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the award ceremony for the federal and district shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festival ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have assumed the patronage.
The original name &quot;Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau&quot; dates back to 1907, when on March 21st the association for &quot;social entertainment by means of practice in rifle shooting and small caliber shooting&quot; was founded.
In 1937, the Nazi regime had caused the association to be dissolved.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found each other again and on April 30th they launched the &quot;new&quot; shooting club &quot;Tannenwald&quot; Berngau in the Gasthaus Lukas.
As marksmen, Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult early period, when it was primarily a question of finding a club location and setting up the shooting range.
As early as autumn 1965, the rifle club in the &quot;Leininger&quot; inn started with two teams in the round competitions.
In the years that followed, the sport shooters, which were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the &quot;Leininger&quot; clubhouse no longer met the requirements of a modern rifle club, the board of directors at the time, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future domicile in the basement of the new &quot;Landgasthof Härteis&quot;.
After 2,700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Pastor Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shooting range.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th district shooting, combined with the ceremonial consecration of the new rifle flag in July 1991.
On April 23rd and 24th, 1994, the rifle club celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a firecracker group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a firecracker referee.
A big challenge for the &quot;Böllerer&quot; and for the club as a whole was the organization of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of voluntary work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round-robin competitions
The sporting achievements of the rifle club are also impressive.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in rounds: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one KK1 sport pistol, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann was promoted from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has been promoted from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as buck jousting, carnival and royal balls, club outings and Christmas parties have a long tradition.
The marksmen are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident while returning to race track
Tony Stewart&#39;s return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire blew out on lap 172, ending his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters.
His team principal, Chad Johnston, said his team of 14 was disappointed but is now focused on next weekend&#39;s race in Richmond, Virginia.
&quot;I wish we&#39;d had a better start and a better result for him,&quot; said Johnston.
We&#39;re going to Richmond and we hope we can do better there.
Earlier in Sunday night&#39;s race, Stewart crashed into a wall after colliding with Kyle Busch and required repairs to the right side of his car.
&quot;I went in today with pretty good hopes of a good result,&quot; said Johnston, adding, &quot;It just didn&#39;t work out.&quot;
Not long after the second accident, Stewart&#39;s car was loaded onto the tow truck and the team was packed and ready to go.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed another driver at a dirt track race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to earn a place in the pursuit.
He returned to work amid an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. He stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has been made as to whether Stewart faces charges.
The three-time champion was greeted with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After starting in 12th position, Stewart had quickly broken into the top 10 and was temporarily fourth.
After a restart on lap 122, Buschs fell
Car #18 out of control exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars hitting the wall.
Stewart continued but dropped back to 21st.
Dance-loving youngsters wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and manager Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to fellow campaigners.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups at TV Jahn also struggle with all-day instruction at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have been severely decimated.
Now there is a growing search for youngsters for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, a former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation &quot;Spirits&quot;, there are only nine children left.
&quot;Three in the group of eight to twelve year olds, six in the group of twelve to 15 year olds,&quot; says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be a lot more fun, &quot;you could dance completely different choreographies,&quot; she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can get a taste of the training session without obligation on Thursdays between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. or on Fridays between 5 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. in the dance gym at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
&quot;Training regularly begins with a warm-up program,&quot; says the trainer.
Then different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no set form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classic to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, there is no shortage of socializing either.
&quot;We sometimes go out to eat, watch dance films and we&#39;ve even slept in the dance room,&quot; reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a wonderful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don&#39;t like jazz dancing, you can also try one of the other TV Jahn offers.
Every Wednesday, children and young people can get a taste of lessons in the areas of children&#39;s dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you fancy discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can stop by and take part.
Bulgarian prison guards are protesting across the country
Hundreds of prison workers from across Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for their old working conditions, which had recently been changed, to be restored.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting the new working hours symbolically for a month, demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
No agreement has been reached despite meetings between the prison workers&#39; union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, Director General for the implementation of punitive measures Rosen Zhelyazkov told BNR.
The prison workers&#39; protest is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Home Office Employees union.
Ukrainian army abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tank battalions are said to have been involved, the Ukrainian army gave up the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk today, Monday.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists said they shot down another fighter jet and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats belonging to the Ukrainian coast guard in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships came under fire near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
A spokesman in Kiev told broadcaster 112.ua that seven border guards were injured.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported taking control of several towns in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
The Ukraine contact group is meeting today in the Belarusian capital of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine was also to take part.
In the run-up, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO is adhering to the 1997 founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of &quot;a blatant breach&quot; of the agreement.
&quot;Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not see NATO as a partner,&quot; Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side show &quot;that they see us as opponents.&quot;
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced plans to increase NATO&#39;s presence in Eastern Europe.
A &quot;readiness action plan&quot; to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that &quot;we will have a more visible NATO presence in the east for as long as this is necessary,&quot; Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official sources, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.
The European Union is still waiting for a decision as to whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets around a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks the word of power: Maut will come &quot;of course&quot;.
Now the chancellor is once again clearly committed to this.
However, it is not a free pass for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU about the car toll have increasingly angered the CSU.
After persistent resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke out in favor of introducing a car toll.
&quot;To put it very clearly: it is in the coalition agreement and it will come,&quot; said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU&#39;s top committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not commit to a detailed model for the time being.
&quot;Certain parameters&quot; are mentioned in the black-red government program.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) &quot;made a proposal and we are now working on it&quot;.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also playing a constructive role in the deliberations on a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke to Dobrindt about other options for activating more private capital for investments in infrastructure, for example for broadband expansion.
&quot;There&#39;s nothing special about it.&quot; Schäuble left a &quot;Spiegel&quot; report uncommented on Sunday that his company was examining its own concept to reward motorway investors with toll income - after the 2017 election.
CSU boss Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts in the cabinet against the lead minister.
CDU Federal Vice Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
&quot;The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads would be subject to tolls,&quot; said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU state chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak about the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations in Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background to this are fears that a toll will affect local border traffic to neighboring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU.
The left sees the plans as a failure in view of the dispute in the Union.
&quot;The botched toll is dead,&quot; said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the &quot;Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung&quot; (Monday).
&quot;The minister fails with the toll&quot;. Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which should start in 2016.
According to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be additionally burdened.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll via the vehicle tax.
However, according to EU law, the model must not discriminate against foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A Brit says she thought she was going to die as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers lived most of her youth believing that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem for people with CMT because so little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsteady gait and crooked toes.
Patients also experience numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she had Friedreich&#39;s Ataxia (FA) - a disease with a very poor chance of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: &quot;As a child I knew I couldn&#39;t do the same as everyone else.
I kept falling and everything took longer for me.
I never got to roller skate or skateboard with the other kids and was often teased at school for the way I walked and ran.
Rodgers said that at age 13, after multiple surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she was looking at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she had FA.
&quot;I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn&#39;t tell anyone, but I went home, looked up the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society,&quot; she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by 18 and die by 25, slowly losing all my abilities in between.
I sorted it all out on my own and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17 she realized her abilities hadn&#39;t diminished as much as she had imagined and consulted her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, &quot;My dear, I don&#39;t think you have this or you would be in a wheelchair by now.&quot;
I think you have something far less life threatening.
After some genetic testing, she was diagnosed with CMT.
&quot;When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,&quot; she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff sergeant a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks technician since the former military training area was closed
There hasn&#39;t been any shooting at the former military training area in Münsingen for almost ten years.
Nevertheless, deadly munitions still turn up every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere reserve.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be detonated on site.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere reserve during the blasting.
In December 2004 the last live shot was fired at the Münsingen military training area, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6,500-hectare area has been the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Washington area business tax burden rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local corporate tax bills in the country rose modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local government agencies in fiscal 2013, a 3.8 percent increase over 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of falling assessments in 2009 and 2010 .
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by services agency Ernst &amp; Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district&#39;s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland&#39;s revenue comes from corporations.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue at 28 percent.
Much of the rise in tax revenue is due to a rebound in corporate property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large portion of those wins came from big states like California, New York and Texas, the pattern seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 -- a 4.2 percent increase over the year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values isn&#39;t as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes account for just over one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Businesses in Virginia and DC pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in real estate taxes.
&quot;What&#39;s happening in Maryland is that a large portion of real estate, particularly in the DC tax area, is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that don&#39;t pay real estate taxes,&quot; said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states provide.
The recent rebound in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the rebound in the real estate market
Corporate earnings also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Businesses in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raked in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the region&#39;s highest.
While trending in the same direction, the local corporate tax burden is not increasing equally in all three locations.
The District&#39;s increase rate of 4.3 percent was in line with the national average, while Maryland&#39;s increase was significantly higher, at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has by far the lowest corporate income taxes in all three jurisdictions (all three have fixed corporate tax rates) at 6 percent.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District is a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local corporate taxes and an overall better tax climate than Maryland.
The district was not examined in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state&#39;s corporate income tax rate to as low as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area appear to be doing better and paying more state and local taxes as a result, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small business people -- a transitional structure under which most small businesses are organized -- in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than that total corporate taxes.
The researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general sales tax receipts for state and local governments increasing 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year same period of the previous year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government&#39;s spending cut impacts the region&#39;s job market.
Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination in China too.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt&#39;s sister city in China now wants a brewery and is also hoping for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt&#39;s twin city of Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
&quot;We would be very happy if a German brewery settled in our city,&quot; said the Deputy Party Secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when an SPD delegation visited his city.
The functionary of the ruling Chinese Communist Party kept coming back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li advertised.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD leader Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would look around Germany for a possible partner for the project.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre,&quot; he added at the luncheon with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already exudes this joie de vivre, he flattered the host.
The functionary from Guangzhou then toasted with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine, which was served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to the German art of brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party leader Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but canceled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
&quot;It would be worth it again,&quot; said the local politician with conviction.
&quot;Business traffic between our two cities is constantly increasing&quot;.
Currently, travelers have to take a detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li lamented.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The provincial vice governor, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this desire in his talks with the social democrats.
&quot;That&#39;s a very good idea,&quot; Schäfer-Gümbel replied. Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, who knows Germany intimately, nodded in agreement.
cultivated partnership
The affable Guangzhou vice leader hopes to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this position.
He only took office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being vigorously enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before joining the party, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic power, the southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse.
Next year, she wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Joan Rivers family &#39;fingers crossed&#39;
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago; however, her daughter today expressed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
&quot;Thank you for your continued love and support,&quot; Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all keep our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital Thursday after suffering an emergency cardiac arrest at an Upper East Side clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors keep them purposely sedated and under close observation until they are more comfortable with their condition, which continues to be described as &quot;serious&quot;.
Reactions came from many quarters, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are going on sale from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1st on which the buyer can see key data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
Stricter nitrogen oxide values apply to new cars in the &quot;Euro 6&quot; emissions class.
There is also more money for the scaffolders: they receive a nationwide standard minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, among a host of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be acquired, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like selling Twitch to Google&#39;s video service for a cool billion was a done deal, and the collaboration seemed natural too.
Twitch, which started just three years ago as Justin.tv, started out as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers looking to get their bravado in games, a &quot;YouTube for live gaming,&quot; according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And &quot;let&#39;s play&quot;, a video genre in which know-it-alls give the (mostly older) games a touch of mystery theater, is already very popular on YouTube.
The fact of the matter is that YouTube is often mentioned when trying to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube was looking to buy Twitch was met with a bit of awe, a textbook example of an established tech company buying up a potential competitor.
It&#39;s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn&#39;t go through, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: &quot;We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us do it faster to get there.&quot;
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who profess that they&#39;d rather play than watch, it&#39;s hard to grasp the attraction of watching others play rather than picking up the control console.
It&#39;s one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3am as she sneaks around Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a weirdo get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could be watching all of these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person, so watching without controlling your point of view can be a really good recipe for a headache.
I&#39;ll concede that the fast-forwards, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.
But unless there&#39;s a gaming or humor virtuoso involved, his Twitch channel probably isn&#39;t that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is viewed by 55 million unique visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic spikes.
And how exactly does Amazon intend to make money from it?
It&#39;s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have easily swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something that every company would like to have: thousands of young men courted as advertisers.
As Twitch Chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch &quot;both believe in the future of gaming,&quot; and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, even - gulp - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on the bouncy castle at the Burggarten Festival on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy downpour on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
Admission had to be stopped at times.
&quot;It was annoying,&quot; said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway.
This was already evident early on Saturday when the first visitors made their way to the open air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedel residents, but also guests from near and far, had made themselves comfortable around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, tapped their feet to the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day.
And that across the generations.
While some lounged on blankets on the specially carted white sand at the beach bar, others drank a glass of wine in the vinotheque, the youngsters romped around on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But the volunteers also had their hands full with the children&#39;s face painting in the truest sense of the word in order to master the rush and conjure up imaginative creations on the little faces.
The older ones used the foosball tables or took part in a skateboard workshop organized by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. it rained down on the visitors, families in particular were looking for space and dryness.
But this did not detract from the attractiveness of the festival.
&quot;More people came than expected,&quot; said Ron Sem, who spoke of &quot;success across the board&quot;.
That&#39;s why nothing stands in the way of repeating the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear to the Volksstimme in a first assessment on Sunday.
He described it as annoying that admission had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously the security company had been booked with too few forces.
As a result, some who had already paid no longer came to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of around 1200 visitors who cavorted in the Burggarten.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks&#39;n&#39;Rox therefore broke off their performance in frustration.
The technicians were unable to create a halfway decent sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a flat tire.
&quot;But they will be there next year,&quot; said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful in terms of visitor numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers made some mistakes that will be forgiven the first time, but will have to be corrected in the second edition.
The organizers also have to take criticism on the social network Facebook.
&quot;Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more,&quot; says Melanie Meier on the event page.
&quot;Unfortunately, you&#39;ve overdone yourself a bit,&quot; says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don&#39;t see the initial problems quite as narrowly.
I think it&#39;s very good that some people don&#39;t just talk nonsense, but also really try to get something going.
Hats off!&quot; Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
The organizers now have one year to put these points of criticism down.
New radome in Berkum: Wachtberg&#39;s landmark is shrinking
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is part of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radome, is being completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 meters, the new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size still remains a world record.
The final step in completing the new case is the cap swap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather cooperates, the campaign should take place at the beginning of this week.
Ice Bucket Challenge participant dislocates her jaw
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so hard when ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman has been hospitalized after screaming so hard she dislocated her jaw during the Ice Bucket Challenge.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain shrieked so hard when ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured the structure of her face.
&quot;The water was so cold I was screaming and while I was doing that my jaw just stopped,&quot; she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but I couldn&#39;t, my jaw was locked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mom and sister saw it too and peed their pants laughing, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Britain was rushed to hospital to have her jaw set after participating in Tuesday&#39;s viral trend.
The clip became an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle associations soon pull together again?
Recently, there have always been disputes between the two Wolfratshausen Castle Associations.
The board members are now considering a possible collaboration.
The late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshausen Castle Friends, led the project in Guédelon, France, as a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshausen Castle.
A year ago there was not a good atmosphere between the castle association and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
The standpoints on how to deal with the history of Wolfratshausen Castle and a possible reconstruction have so far seemed extremely different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: Talks about a joint approach are to be held soon.
The board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this when asked by our newspaper.
&quot;I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together,&quot; reports Sjöberg.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
In this way, visible successes can be recorded more quickly.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had their sights set on rebuilding the castle in the mountain forest, for the castle association around Sjöberg the &quot;development and experience&quot; of the site is the top priority.
According to Herbert Piffl, Vice Chairman of the Burgfreunde, he was very happy about the call.
Since Dimbath&#39;s death he has headed the friends of the castle.
A new chairman is to be found at a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
&quot;After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we let the club&#39;s activities rest for the time being out of respect.&quot; This &quot;thinking phase&quot; was necessary to &quot;consider how things could go on&quot;.
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then enter into discussions with the castle association.
Until then, the friends of the castle could also get an up-to-date picture of the mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
&quot;But I&#39;m confident that someone will be found.&quot; He himself does not want to run as a candidate because he lives in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to &quot;be very happy to continue working on the project&quot;.
In the eyes of Piffl, the different points of view regarding reconstruction will probably remain in place for the foreseeable future.
He credits Dimbath as a &quot;missionary&quot; who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, well-advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is no pipe dream.
Due to the high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: &quot;I was skeptical at first too.
But over time I became more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward.&quot; A &quot;unique selling point&quot; could be created for the rafting town.
There&#39;s nothing else here.
Piffl believes that the project could also be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors.
&quot;Personally, I don&#39;t want to just throw the idea of reconstruction overboard.&quot; He hopes that the Burgverein might move a bit on this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story &quot;is important and good&quot;.
After that you can see further.
Clever ways to save on college textbooks
With college textbooks costing more than $1,000 a year for many students, nearly sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a clever savings plan.
He invented a lending system for senior students&#39; books and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
&quot;My math book is usually $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie,&quot; said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
College officials said students spend an average of more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but students have several cost-containment options.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 college bookstores, said textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, said Neebo&#39;s vice president Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here&#39;s the basics for the best deals.
buy online
Some new books online are only a third of what they are for in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of &quot;Calculus&quot; by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290 but can be purchased from specialty textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
To buy second hand
If you don&#39;t mind other people&#39;s notes or normal wear and tear, used books are a good option.
&quot;Calculus&quot; is available pre-owned on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of &quot;Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.&quot;
The book sold new for $48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students check with their professors to see if past editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the term papers.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc&#39;s Half.com is a popular alternative for used books.
To rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, are thinking of returning them, and don&#39;t want to keep the books after you&#39;ve completed the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent &quot;Calculus&quot; for a semester for about $20.
Find out about the policies of the shop you are renting from, including penalties that may apply for writing notes, underlining, or scuffing.
Renters beware: If you don&#39;t return the book, the fines can even exceed the price of a new book.
eBooks
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are actually rented by providing an electronic license for a period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.
Chegg rents &quot;Calculus&quot; for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, since many classics are now free to download, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely have a look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number when pricing books so you can be sure you&#39;re finding the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks to deliver and ended up paying full price at the college bookstore.
Why &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; didn&#39;t become a box office hit
Sylvester Stallone&#39;s &quot;The Expendables 3&quot; grossed less than $30 million of its $90 million US budget, while &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot; grossed just $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-tailored &#39;Sex Tape&#39; grossed just $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children&#39;s films like &#39;How to Train Your Dragon 2&#39; also disappoint in terms of grossing.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that when it comes to children&#39;s films, the lack of quality in the films themselves may be to blame.
Calling 2014 &quot;the worst year&quot; yet for children&#39;s movies, Collin described How to Train Your Dragon 2 as a purely &quot;functional&quot; fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer release released on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year.
The results are based on the opinions of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year&#39;s hit films are on par with last year&#39;s.
Some commentators say the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney&#39;s upcoming The Jungle Book movie, told the Hollywood Reporter website, &quot;I think times are changing.&quot;
We have to accept that and not try to run after the past.
In contrast to the currently weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues from the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost double the previous year&#39;s revenue of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for focusing too much on comic book adaptations and predicted a &quot;meltdown&quot; in Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there may well be some truth to his dire prophecy.
However, with potential box office hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other industry figures are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in box office earnings as simply &quot;cyclical,&quot; telling The Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Next summer is going to be the biggest summer at the box office ever and nobody&#39;s going to worry about business anymore make.&quot;
A few years ago, when the 2nd table tennis district class was canceled in order to streamline the league division, that was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has added an additional 3rd national league to its program.
As a result, those who didn&#39;t climb were relegated.
Göttingen&#39;s highest-class team Torpedo avoided relegation in the Oberliga relegation, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedo&#39;s women remain in fourth place, despite their grandiose march through to the regional league.
The boys and girls from Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys from SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve compete in the new association league, in the state league there are no more clubs from Göttingen.
For women, TTV Geismar plays in the association league, Torpedo comes second in the national league.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district upper league south.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete here.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class the TTC II, Rot-Weiss, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The women&#39;s district league starts at least in target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are involved here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams
SC Weende sends its girls to the small district league.
The district league season of the SCW boys - where Torpedo II starts - is not complete.
Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV start the season in a district class.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
In the west squadron are the Rot-Weiss II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the eastern season.
The women&#39;s district league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
That&#39;s still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no longer any women&#39;s teams at district level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd district classes reached the target strength, here the innovative and busy district board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, around 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall there to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments for us over the weekend and spoke to protesters who have traveled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenager flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers have been winched to safety after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains of NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man left Govetts Leap in Blackheath for their tour just after Sunday lunchtime.
Concerned relatives called the police at around 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party made up of local police and emergency services left and the couple were found around 11pm near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight and they were flown out Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital by ambulance in stable condition.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The broadcaster resumed broadcasting after a good half hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters, armed with sticks, damaged equipment in the newsroom.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said around a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#39;s residence, around 3,000 demonstrators clashed again on Monday with security forces.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend as protesters attempted to advance to Sharif&#39;s residence.
They are demanding the resignation of the prime minister.
After a meeting at army headquarters on Sunday evening, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict &quot;without wasting time and without using violence&quot;.
The statement went on to say: &quot;The army remains committed to its role of ensuring the security of the state&quot;.
The escalating violence has fueled fears of military intervention, which has a history of coups.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been ongoing since August 14 Independence Day.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri called on their supporters on Sunday to hold out.
&quot;We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,&quot; Khan said.
Qadri made a similar statement.
Khan accuses Sharif of fraudulently winning last May&#39;s parliamentary elections.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then an interim government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators initially held out peacefully in front of Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif&#39;s residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer in third place after the second win of the season.
With the 2-0 win over Grödig, a bitter week came to a happy end for Rapid on Sunday.
&quot;The victory is very liberating,&quot; said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the end of the Europa League on Thursday.
&quot;The sense of achievement was incredibly important,&quot; confirmed captain and goalscorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
Schrammel&#39;s dream goal puts Rapid on the road to victory With their second win of the season, Rapid showed the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes into the international break with a sense of achievement.
&quot;We wanted to show a positive reaction,&quot; said full-back Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his wonderful volley from the penalty area in the 14th minute.
&quot;I thought I&#39;d take all the frustration from Thursday and snap it under the bar,&quot; said the 26-year-old with a smile.
When Schrammel scored for the last time in a Bundesliga game on November 13, 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in rapid dress will therefore remain in his memory.
&quot;It&#39;s something very special for me, I&#39;m from the Rapid youth team,&quot; said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic&#39;s short-term pelvic injury, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did a very good job there as well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in reverse.
He deserved the goal, he has already provided a few assists this year,&quot; praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the cross to make it 2-0 through Hofmann after just over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written to them.
&quot;Thank God we had a bit of luck today,&quot; said Schrammel, referring to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: &quot;The results weren&#39;t right, but the gameplay was always good compared to last year.&quot; .
Barisic even found that &quot;many games before were better than today&quot; - against &quot;the strongest team that played in this stadium this season&quot;.
The first three-pointer since July 26 has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: &quot;Today my team showed that they have character&quot;.
No less gratifying for him: &quot;The fact that we finally kept a clean sheet again&quot;.
Lots of work during the international break The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger were all absent and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their starting XI debuts made the win even more valuable.
&quot;One must not forget that,&quot; warned Barisic, who lost players in Behrendt and Pavelic in the past three days, &quot;who have been very stable lately&quot;.
The international break must therefore be used to &quot;lick wounds and gain a bit more physically,&quot; explained Barisic, who has five U21 players in his ranks.
Captain Hofmann is one for whom the break is particularly convenient.
He tears himself up for the team, goes over it in pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he showed that he is a very important player for us,&quot; Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure before being substituted in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who played his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first goal from open play since November 2, 2013 (4:2 via Admira).
Hofmann: &quot;We mustn&#39;t believe that everything is fine now&quot; &quot;We certainly had a bit of luck, but luck has to come back to us at some point.
Now it was high time,&quot; said Hofmann.
Of course, he warned to continue working in a concentrated manner: &quot;You can&#39;t always see things in black and white.
We haven&#39;t played as badly in the past few weeks as has been portrayed.
But we mustn&#39;t think that everything is fine now either.
He couldn&#39;t deny the importance of his role to the team.
It&#39;s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
In certain phases they stick to me,&quot; said Hofmann.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his team for.
He regretted the quick goal &quot;from the magic goal category&quot; and the regular goal by Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only criticism I can level against the team is that we weren&#39;t specific enough towards the goal in some phases.
We didn&#39;t have enough degrees there.
Central defender Maximilian Karner saw it the same way: &quot;It started badly right away, but then we found our way in and even scored a goal.
All in all it could have been more.
Under this treetop there is peace
We showed a mighty trunk in our puzzle task of the summer series &quot;My Piece of Rhöner Glück&quot; last Friday.
There are still several of these giant trees in the district, the example shown is the &quot;Geißruheiche&quot; above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It goes past paddocks, basalt rock piles and basalt rock seas.
A little below the Bauersberg quarry, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it is.
The natural monument looks vital, it towers above the other trees in the area and, with a circumference of over eight meters, is reminiscent of an American sequoia.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
dr Wolfgang Schneider specifically consulted the Bischofsheim archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what happened to the goat oak.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, the goatherds are said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stone-free meadows up until about 80 years ago.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers, exhausted from the ascent, are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because herds of goats are actually grazing on the meadows again.
The area has also been declared a core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, one should exercise caution when entering the stone accumulations, because the basalt, which has been warmed up by the sun, is also a popular place for adders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other paths are signposted that climb towards the Hochrhön and invite you to take a long hike.
Where is the moated castle?
A moated castle, which is what we are looking for in our next task, is rarely found at this height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district that the picture of the building could match.
Where is our &quot;piece of Rhöner Glück&quot; located?
My piece of Rhön happiness
As with previous Main-Post series in previous years, there are prizes to be won this year if you come up with the right solution.
Anyone who likes to take photos can also take part.
You can send us the solution and also your very personal &quot;piece of Rhöner Glück&quot; to the e-mail address red.neustadt@mainpost.de using this keyword.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy&#39;s prime minister and incumbent EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, pushed through the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week. She will succeed Britain&#39;s Catherine Ashton.
As the pro-government daily La Repubblica reports, Renzi sees the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also a favorite in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects this to give a boost to his &quot;package of reforms&quot; in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to pacify the left-wing base of the party, which keeps protesting against him, because Mogherini is associated with him, albeit in a more moderate way.
The prevailing opinion in Rome was that a political balance was being struck with the conservative representatives, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland&#39;s Donald Tusk, who was nominated as Council President.
Because the EU&#39;s chief diplomat will also be deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an &quot;important recognition&quot; of Italy&#39;s role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that Mogherini, who has held leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will show herself equal to the &quot;enormous challenges&quot;.
Born in Rome, she is married and has two daughters.
The doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic center party Margherita in 2008 to form today&#39;s social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth for three years.
When she was elected to the party council of the Left Democrats in 2001, she entered high party politics and worked in the foreign policy department, of which she soon became head.
She occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on the NATO mission in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the USA.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert on defense and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD now has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party&#39;s more than 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as PD circles note, Federica Mogherini has a part to play.
The allegations in Brussels that the new EU foreign policy chief has too little diplomatic experience, and therefore lacks substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini&#39;s realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are suspiciously followed and defamed as a &quot;Russia-friendly course&quot;.
She supports the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gazprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy&#39;s energy supply.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini made her first state visit to Moscow.
Photos showing her shaking hands with Putin were met with outrage in Brussels, as was the fact that she invited the Kremlin boss to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another apprenticeship in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four apprenticeships: electronics technician (three trainees), mechatronics technician (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the Schwandorf district: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended secondary schools, middle schools and junior high schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years and the trainers go to a team building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees across all years is 27.
The socialists in France should &quot;shut up and put France in order,&quot; said Francois Hollande&#39;s main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show &quot;their love&quot; for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone&#39;s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
&quot;It&#39;s our duty to stay by his side,&quot; he said to great applause.
As a placating gesture, the prime minister insisted his government would not question France&#39;s controversial 35-hour working week, despite strong calls for a relaxation of the rule from Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show themselves &quot;united&quot; with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw a spanner in the works by speaking at a meeting of breakaway socialist MPs and criticizing the socialist party for robbing the French of &quot;the belief in their future&quot;.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the Socialists&#39; constant infighting and said she could not see the new Valls government holding out for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor with no clothes, but neither does Prince Manuel Valls, who are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn&#39;t survived even a summer.
&quot;And the new one won&#39;t survive the fall or winter either,&quot; Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party&#39;s call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of emerging victorious in snap elections and ready to govern.
France&#39;s ruling party suffered a defeat in local elections in March and the right-wing National Front won EU elections in May.
A poll in Sunday&#39;s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before Hollande&#39;s term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment.
&quot;There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that things are changing,&quot; he warned.
Otherwise the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise on the verge of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world&#39;s third largest cruise operator, is in advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry insiders.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises&#39; luxury cruise lines and its affluent clientele, while dealing with larger rivals like Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) is in competition.
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could end inconclusively.
Prestige Cruises&#39; owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations are not public.
Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its 2013 revenue was $2.57 billion, a 13 percent increase over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion for 2013, up 6 percent from the previous year.
The cruise industry as a whole is about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets like China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed for an IPO with US regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo held 20 percent of the shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together control 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise lines, according to Prestige Cruises&#39; original IPO offering documents.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Sunday passed a framework law allowing just two or three candidates for Hong Kong&#39;s 2017 leadership election.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee, which is expected to be staffed with members loyal to Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get a seat in the elections and prompted pro-democracy activists to carry out their threat to paralyze Hong Kong&#39;s financial center with &quot;Occupy Central&quot; protests.
Political reform has long been a contentious issue in Hong Kong; and China&#39;s party leadership fears calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the release of a Beijing white paper outlining China&#39;s supremacy over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, during which hundreds of thousands marched into the city&#39;s business district and staged a sit-in.
Li&#39;s interrogation is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and vice director of the State Council&#39;s Office of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, Feng Wei, were scheduled to be questioned later in the day.
Student activists announced they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Great Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial rule in Hong Kong.
Putin is demanding that Kiev start &quot;statehood talks&quot; with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the &quot;statehood&quot; of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled area of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine would have to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to to represent his rights and interests.
However, Putin&#39;s call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits in with the strategy he appears to have been pursuing since the riots began five months ago: helping the separatists seize territories and pressuring the Ukrainian government to to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin condemned Ukraine&#39;s military campaign to retake separatist-held areas in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, taken in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine&#39;s Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently dubbed the captured territory &quot;Novorossiya&quot; or &quot;New Russia,&quot; a term evoking the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those hoping for peace talks in the wake of Ukrainian politicians&#39; campaigns for Oct. 26 elections and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held areas are &quot;trapped in their illusions,&quot; Itar reported - cup
&quot;We must immediately start detailed talks, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine in order to protect the interests of the people living there,&quot; he said.
Peskov said Putin&#39;s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which the Kiev leadership has been discussing for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskov said.
This isn&#39;t about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, &quot;because it&#39;s not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it&#39;s about an internal conflict in Ukraine.&quot;
The Kremlin spokesman&#39;s clarification to correct the &quot;misreading&quot; of Putin&#39;s remarks underscored Russia&#39;s leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, given that most of the country&#39;s 6.5 million residents are non-Russian and pre-conflict polls showed a large majority to remain in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which has been raised by Russian diplomats at international fora, would give regional governments in Ukraine full powers to negotiate their own trade deals and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that shares Russian territory with Crimea connects.
Annexed five months ago, the Black Sea peninsula is the home port for most of the Russian Navy, as well as a major trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inauguration speech on June 7, suggested that the Ukrainian legislature - after new elections - consider amendments to the constitution that give the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his vision of autonomy appears to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the Separatist rebels whom Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin&#39;s latest call for Kyiv to negotiate on an equal footing with separatist leaders comes after another rebel push last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists seized control of Novoazovsk in a coup d&#39;état that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region stretching as far as Crimea.
Because of this, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel-industrial port of 500,000 people that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow gateway to the Crimean Peninsula.
Speaking at an EU leaders&#39; meeting in Brussels on Saturday, Poroshenko urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
&quot;We are approaching a point of no return,&quot; Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian tanks and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defense Council, told reports in Kiev on Saturday .
The first suspected 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian incursion into Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has made no secret of his anger at hackers who are believed to have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who&#39;s Who of Hollywood A-listers.
Movie city is in a fuss after a series of explicit photos of a nude Jennifer Lawrence surfaced online in a celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for this appears to have over 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne also reportedly leaked private photos due to an iCloud vulnerability.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: &quot;It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It&#39;s a shame that private information can be stolen and shared with others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was &quot;shameful&quot; and that those affected felt &quot;hurt.&quot;
The hacker believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying topless in a pool.
Palmer&#39;s film credits include Love Is Invincible, starring Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning were unavailable to comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A Lawrence rep told TMZ, &quot;It&#39;s a heinous invasion of privacy.&quot;
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: &quot;Posting hacked pictures from a cell phone is no different than selling stolen goods.&quot;
From a purely legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th cycling up the Großer Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association &quot;Help for Children with Cancer&quot;.
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, was easy training for others.
However, everyone agreed on one thing: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery rode his bike up the Feldberg yesterday.
For a good cause.
He can easily get over the little sore muscles, especially since taking part in the 8th cycling event on the Großer Feldberg for the benefit of the association &quot;Help for Children with Cancer&quot; (Frankfurt) also brought him valuable personal insight.
A great thing.
&quot;Now I know I can do it - great!&quot;
A little break on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who represents the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants struggled up the mountain yesterday in the early morning and came close to exhaustion but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to cover the eleven-kilometer stretch between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The Greens politician from the district council, who appeared all in red - red dress, red bike - made a bit of an understatement at the start (&quot;Lots of professionals, the aim is to get there!&quot;), but then turned out to be a semi-pro on the mountain and crossed the finish line after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He, too, completed the route in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the &quot;Feldberg cycle&quot; wasn&#39;t necessarily a sporting challenge: &quot;This is about charity, we&#39;re happy to be part of it - we would have done a ride today anyway,&quot; says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) drove down to Oberursel in the morning, only to pedal back up the hill immediately afterwards.
Frankfurt&#39;s Florian Zierz got into the saddle at 9 a.m. at home, &quot;did&quot; the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home having fun.
&quot;Fritten-Toni&quot; also had fun.
For the boss of the Oberursel cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had aimed for 40 minutes on his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I&#39;m happy to be there,&quot; said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained man from Mainz says that he is an &quot;ambitious racing cyclist&quot;.
He has to be, because he was on the road with the &quot;fixie bike&quot;, which are also racing bikes, but without gears...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit proved that it was easy to climb up without a bike, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Mountain rescue doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who ensured safety with his team, equipped with a four-wheel drive bully and quad, said: &quot;I know him from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself.&quot; In a way, the man is his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - more than ever before - were sent out in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the &quot;Radeln auf den Großer Feldberg&quot; association, gave the starting commands and wished the participants a pleasant trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to close the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
