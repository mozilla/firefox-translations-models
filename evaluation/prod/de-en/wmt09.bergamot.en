The Prague Stock Exchange crashes into the cut against the closing of business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of EZ reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its burglary on Monday at the beginning of Tuesday's business, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time the reason for the burglary was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market is shown by the reaction of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it refused to support a stabilisation plan for the local financial sector.
Case of shares in Asia
The shares on the stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic case on Tuesday, although the indices could offset part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later compensated for some of the losses, so the decline decreased to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased the losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell by 3.6 percent according to the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the USA is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," says the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, even though it is part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for supporting the financial system.
Otherwise it is threatened that other countries would also be affected by the slump.
A bloodbath of American shares
The House of Representatives rejected Monday the plan to support the financial system, which should be spent up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 trillion K).
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would govern the fundamental causes of the financial crisis, helping to stabilise the entire economy.
The American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the main equity indices recorded the largest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by nearly seven percent, and had recently seen a similar slump in 1987.
The index had already dropped before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes its concession: US government allows to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The supreme representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid for the American financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
American legislators achieved a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a financial aid for the American financial system worth 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The congressmen still need to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank told the Reuters agency.
According to various figures, the Senate could probably vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication that the plan is being adopted should be the first major psychological factor for financial market revival.
However, then this leads to a "sepelection" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a market stabilisation package should look like," said Democrat Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Legislators met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the night of Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsteellable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market.
The recovery plan needs to be continued, but I think we are our goal," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada's Democratic senator, Harry Reid, legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before the Sunday in Congress.
This means that investors want to reassure business on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by Congress could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not yet entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the last-minute negotiations could not fail because of a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will continue to undergo some changes.
The total amount determined to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush evaluates progress in negotiations positively
The president has a right of veto in this decision, but the Congress may overregrate its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has persisted, based on obtaining finances for buying poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We have worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and "appreciate the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and is setting up a committee to which there is to be supervised the fund.
The Ministry of Finance is to head this.
"We have worked very hard to make a major step forward to an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also counts to help homeowners who have problems repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it buys up, with the goal of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"And because one does not know by which mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for the financial sector and the government to split the losses among themselves," said Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Marek's view does not determine whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree to support the plan and to abandon it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement about the adoption is the most important thing at this moment," said Marek.
Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they reach 29 percent
According to the initial preliminary results, a noticeable weakening of both parties of the grand parties to the grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly harsh losses, where the position of the former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the edge.
In contrast, the election leader of the alliance is working for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider, for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP performed even worse, which lost almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-Austrian history, and especially with the People's Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a really disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the initial reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party leader and previous vice-knightly Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party executive.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes for the time being - at the same time granted the Social Democrats exempt their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had reached collusion with the populists (at the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with a joint government, which had even s.
Jörg Haider, who has already declared, is obviously based on this development, is prepared to cooperate with each party and expects a return to Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party also moved into parliament, which, however, suffered slight losses and slid from the third place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentage hurdle and therefore did not come into parliament.
Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We will advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Therefore, of course, it looks so that it is better to buy only one phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons why you should get a player independent.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
You can hardly buy a great expensive record player for your home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably at least dream of one.
Simply put - music in MP3 format is therefore with music when travelling, i.e. with compressed music.
There are price and quality categories here too.
It may not be acceptable for one player to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink floy fan will hardly handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The service life of the batteries is also decisive.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can't do they even manage to do it suggestively.
No modern device is as universal as using it as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone calling and the ledge, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes worse camera and maybe can also navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and not take pictures of a TV.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy guzzlers.
Only a few phones can play music for longer than ten-twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (mostly the easiest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, you should expect the cheap phones to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you then occasionally make a call, buy a charger for the office for security - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good ones hold out at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charging.
Another problem is if you want to transfer the music to the mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB termination, and not every phone without special software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers are finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
With players, you do not need any special software, with the exception (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most cell phones and players themselves create a music library, arranged according to the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the lifetime of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If you have music against the setting for you and listen to it every day only briefly, for example, in the tram, any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What really almost any phone can do.
You don't need to control what music formats a mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3 create all, and the most music you receive, will be in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sale of music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of the phone carry with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free system with you.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest typically cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will not be normal headphones.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in turn in easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve every player.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an inadvertently employed mobile Internet and a subsequently horrendous bill for data transmissions.
After which device you should now grab
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. B. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for replaceable storage media (type M2, microSD u. o.).
Even if you purchase a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But beware.
In the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and still want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you then do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Belong to the more challenging listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is similar to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest here is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will afford MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider will come to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all the services offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is nothing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic ones at lower prices.
Perhaps it will not be long in coming.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that Czech mobile providers are working to be the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority 'T', which pointed out that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition, which really makes a challenge.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to swear about the fact that there is a lot of competition on the Czech market.
The chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (T) Pavel Dvorak, who had often said in the past that there is no place for another provider in the Czech Republic, is often also told that there is no place for another provider.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a large number of chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies left).
But there is one more possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which was then also had to react to by the traditional mobile phone providers.
Before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar votes in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, you don't need to look long for examples.
In February we reported on the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the country's fifth largest provider.
The Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, is Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can concentrate on a much more specific target group.
In order to be able to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less comprehensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers at least half more cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a fairly good move to rely on a non-clichical target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust them," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
The press spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav Ã...epickÃ1⁄2 doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual vendors are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the range of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, mobile providers think
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"Although we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will rather enter the market in other countries in our region," says a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana StudniÃ3ková, press spokeswoman for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile phone providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined towards this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Their interest in the launch of a virtual mobile phone provider has been shown for some time now, the GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of TelefÃ3nica O2 in the corporate customer sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line telecommunications services, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile operators about this possibility.
We have already been able to achieve progress with some of them," said Pavel Kaidl, press spokesman for the group.
Perhaps there are better times now.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual provider is perhaps expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this has been surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specific features compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has yet been talking to us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil SrÃ3eÃ3 from the press department of TelefÃ3nica O2.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
The press spokeswoman for T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the O2 declaration: "So far, we have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which one could continue to build."
And she adds: "Until the end of the year, no virtual provider will appear on the T-Mobile network.
At this moment we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses his attention more on meeting the requirements of your own 3G license.
Miroslav Ã...epickÃ3 comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
From the customer's perspective, we see this as the best.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thereby also a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor make it easier for market entry?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something, the long back and forth is also proven by the origin of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards 'T' went from T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came onto the market.
This is also proven by the publicly available information from the T-Websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute lack of interest from the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the T, which unfortunately - in contrast to Great Britain and other highly developed states - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
This holds exclusively the office for the protection of economic competition (OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problematic its very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile phone provider and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers," said in his reply to our Kristián Chalupa request from the Department of External Relations at the Ã...OHS.
Such a formulation would not surprise by representatives of the provider.
This is more than alarmed by an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that nobody abuses their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreign, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a reduction in price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are not among the interests of the OHS.
In this case, the almost touching concert of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question of whether it is really only a coincidence is obvious.
Just like the absolutely same petrol price at the petrol stations is certainly only a coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
"The authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate action against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the provider has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trading in the market.
The telecommunications regulatory authority included the necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market for virtual providers," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated from the 'T', according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone providers will have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider has the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you don't go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning that three mobile phone providers are strikingly similar.
Complaints to a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The shifting of responsibility to the 'T' is then a pretty common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the 'OHS' distances itself from the whole matter.
This was already observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to enforce the extension of the competences of the T to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know all too well, but probably they have other interests.
It's going when nobody looks
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, which are only partly public.
Usually these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others, for example, offer your own mobile telephone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile providers prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it can be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then be dealing with, which can lead to an end to the cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that this does not talk around those responsible for the mobile providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, these may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
They do not flow into neglect profits from the activities of these companies, at the same time they - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav 'epick' draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are used by only a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full advantage of it as the normal customers of mobile providers."
But that alone would have to happen at least strange.
In addition, another question opens up for the OHS.
If the mobile providers close their eyes before such an approach, why do they lock themselves up against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the Ã...OHS has quite a strong competence to uncover such activities, and if it does not want, it does not have to be satisfied with the providers' declaration that they would not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been pointed out several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought a significant decline in prices for the various services.
In practically all countries, where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their origins practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a too small, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened, which did not try to protect the interests of mobile providers, but those of their customers, were taking action at the very moment.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was formed, and others followed others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators throw themselves to the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But let's not throw the shotgun into the grain.
If the background information is right and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows a virtual mobile provider to develop, the OHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminate).
And the Czechs will finally no longer make more phone calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Wo is my homeland in a ceremony.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of JiÃ3 BÃ3lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The singing version was included in the singing version by Katerina KnÃ3nková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremicác and Jaroslav Krek.
Listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
The Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns for BÃ3lohlávek.
He had already told Czech Radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both and then also with the choir, so that the text is well understood, so that a consistency is created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will be celebrated 175 next year. Anniversary.
The song "Kde domov mÃ3j" was first performed on the stage of the Estates Theatre in the originally Czech play Fidlovaka by Josef Kajetán Tyl in 1834, the music was written by Franti ek Ã...kroup.
It became popular, and people accepted it spontaneously.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the independent Czech Republic was created.
How does the "new" anthem sound
Prague's transport companies are also transporting for the first time on a chip on Wednesday
The Wednesday, the 1. October 2008, will be included in the history of Prague's transport companies as a date when the first passengers enter a metro, tram or bus, who carry an electronic coupon in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
About one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard can buy it at present.
Passengers can take a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1. January 2009) and have it played on their chip cards at the same time, namely in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, MÃ3stek, NádraÃ3 HoleÃovice, AndÃ1⁄2l, Roztyly, Letsany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kaserov and Luka.
The coupons are also available since yesterday via the Internet on the pages of the www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the metro stations, where they have previously had to wait regularly on their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is installed on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the municipal library.
"At these points, travellers also have a counter with trained staff who advise interested parties on their online purchase and also places the coupon on the map," says the spokesperson for the Martin Opatrn project.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the open card at self-service machines, which are installed in some metro van missiles.
What do such vending machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket worthy ones, the passengers may already have them in the metro stations Roztyly, BudÃ3jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská noticed.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it shall be eighty," OpatrnÃ3 adds.
The coupon controls a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
You only need to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of municipalities in the region of Central Bohemia reach the capital.
"On trains belonging to Prague's integrated traffic, train attendants have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons according to the time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the Ropid organisation ticket control. This organisation compils the timetables for Prague's transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the cash desk at the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown at the driver, but the Opencard must be created at a marked location on the side of the checkout.
The driver thus checks the validity of the mounted coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons picked up, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and does not know when the validity of the coupon ends can again go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is displayed on the device's display.
The Sudetes demanded a referendum from the USA
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had requested the affiliation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is revealed in a letter storing in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is shown, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumlov ask the American President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says a letter signed in the words "people who have the fate of the Sudeten on".
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia suggests the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the patronage of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you have to a foreign state for us to speak to a foreign state that tries to eliminate minorities and tries to eliminate minorities and contributed purely nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US president had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it is sufficient if he were to initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forestgau whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, however, according to some contemporary witnesses, it paints a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least had to know that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the republic, only a few of them had such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed they could simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis, also confirms this.
He was used at war as Budweiser Deutscher in the Navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he was taken prisoner by the British at the end of the war and he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, they would fit the Czech one," said Chalupa.
In his opinion, no one of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war expected that he would be driven out of the republic on the basis of the Benes decrees.
Do not think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive action on the streets in Czech history.
This is also what the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday could be characterised.
The authority of Minister Alesce Ã...ebÃ1⁄2ek promises to dissuade drivers from behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be screened on television, on the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to disable drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to strap on before steps.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
Do not think - then pay!
The words "not think" are in capital letters on a label.
And in a pool of blood is then the word "pays".
This should mean that one can pay for a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the audience by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can see images with drastic shots of accident victims.
It suggests that the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities on the Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and stick for drivers
"The motto of carrot and stick applies to the riders.
Sugar bread means that when they ride on red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of the Na Homolce hospital Martin Koán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
In his opinion, blackboards are less effective, which draw the riders' attention to danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns about a danger, it will probably soon flow away with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer perceive them," says Koán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has said advocated the return of practically all areas that were occupied in 1967, including the Jordan country, east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be made in exchange for it.
This was what he stressed in an interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it becomes necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to pay a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants safety in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as one of my best friends happened, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, killing several people and injuring dozens.
According to the premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
"The one who wants to uphold Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That will not work," he further affirmed.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his opinion is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
"The Syrians know only too well what they have to do without to get the Golan heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shi) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they grant to the terrorism of the (Shi) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister concretized.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused of collecting beetles in India, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg could lead to a certain cooling of Czech-India relations, according to the Czech Republic.
This was emphasised by the Minister in New York after the meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clarify, then certainly, then there is a certain cooling down," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he commented that in the case of Petr vácha, who was acquitted from the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wanted to fall, in the case of which the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," said the minister.
For Emil Kuera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he were to appeal to a higher authority.
He could so ask for release on bail and wait for his verdict in freedom, said the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be considered for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted "competent legal support" the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also give that too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency "TK", the Czech Republic confirmed great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to imprison and charge these Czech scientists," he explained.
The Minister gave an answer to the question of whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter.
"I was already promised quite a lot," he merely stated.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards illegal on the bus?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance coach there is not permitted to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth during the bus ride.
"If we strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardes last week, was probably caused by the truck driver, who crossed the bus the way.
The young woman sat at that moment to make every misfortune next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or sharply slow down, in which the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing room after the vehicle registration form.
If this is not provided for on the bus, travellers must sit.
The short-distance coaches of the Student Agency have no standing space; what the director of the company, Radim Jansura, confirmed to Aktuáln.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not agree to the movement of travellers first.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers are allowed to go to the toilet during the trip if they have their seat," he said, he said.
The law knows no steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle companion; however, it does not define its rights and obligations," adds the spokesman of the ministry of Hanzelka.
The director of the Road Vehicles department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn, on the other hand, thinks that the law subsequently covers this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has standing room in the product approval.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing room and higher allowed speed and long-distance coaches without standing room with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP road safety specialist Jaroslav HoÃ3n does not see any fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"There are not many dangers in a smooth driving style, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it is not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can push their heads."
"However, a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must clarify the safety of the stewards by means of internal regulations," he says, saying, and also says that this problem is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Janura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider their job to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of the steward is risky, I will delete it.
Travellers can get coffee and newspapers when they get on board.
That would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared with the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, we are fighting against it from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had said not quite a year ago for TÃ3den.cz.
This was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had had an accident that had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the tractor without flashing and had blocked the ride from the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by means of a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front party with the truck.
That the two places for the stewards were sold, disputes Janura.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck driver.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty.
A legislative amendment?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the Stewards movement on board a fine could bring a legal regulation on which a thirty team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when traveling," says specialist HoÃ3n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activities of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, whereby the control of the safety of the buses is the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
A Czech pointed around the river sea floor
It approaches an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent lake areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of UN councillors for oceans and sea rights.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements them.
There are work budgets and enthusiasm here.
The seabed has hitherto housed a little-known world, which is rich in natural springs.
This is where oil can be found, furthermore ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed, larger than the mainland
The neighbouring countries today vehemently expressed their claim to the new sea areas.
After a UN convention, they are making use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches into the sea until a few hundred kilometres from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country is entitled to all sources of the continental shelf.
"In some case, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea of the river, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to set the external borders of the continental shelf must be documented by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many costly studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the latter three countries have had success," adds Mikulka.
An international response recently encountered the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was granted to the country by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will allow them to flow from the use of the seabed in the future will have an invaluable value, as they promise.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montgo Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the territory of the ocean floor begins, which is called the "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention.
There is no state there.
The right to promote in this area grants an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a gold mining country," says Director Mikulka by somewhat exaggerating, adding that "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also part of the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
Due to the convention in 1991, as did the investors of a few other states, this received the status of a so-called "purpose-breaking investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"There is a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another jurisdiction, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, the legendary shem, which, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB board does not lack the staff of the company in big words.
The merge of units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with Frankfurter Deka Bank could be created "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", according to the letter known on Monday.
WestLB would entail a "strong competence block" with sustainable earning power into such a business.
And such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in difficult time.
Because the ailing WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear, it is not only the time to find a future solution.
However, however, there has been talk of a kind of connection between the Deka bank, which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and WestLB - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank CEO Franz Waas showed when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, he sees no sense in a merger of the house on Mainz Landstraße with a state bank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and the savings bank associations, has commissioned the Executive Board to hold talks with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could involve capital markets or parts of it.
The talks, of course, have only just begun, as the financial centre says.
There is no first talk of Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the Financial Centre Frankfurt, when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked for a moment as if the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this triple federation did not come.
As soon as the plans became public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba's involvement in it.
The other two houses did not think each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart instead.
But there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka Bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about a meeting with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that the coming together of the various houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, the first thing that BayernLB could move closer to a connection with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure rise to further mergers, their partners gradually go out.
In the south, it would only be junior partners, although it has been far better at the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Once again, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds a stake in Helaba with 85 percent, put a stop at the beginning of the year, which is held together with West LB.
At most, the North LB remained.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken was not yet answered by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association.
At the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which is not desired there, of course.
The letter from the Executive Board there is also talk of a "total solution" for the house in any case.
It will become clear how this can be brought under one roof with the Deka Bank with the merging of individual units.
The second weekend is known as the "Italy weekend"
For Elena, it is the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, in the five-litre beebody of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built beard tiger and proves the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travellers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca first a slap, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station, start this evening at 11.45 pm four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected to be 6.30 am.
Three buses are reserved mainly for the Italians, only Brazilians travel in a bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says, that is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with imitation fur lining and glasses with wide silver temples, includes the buses.
For five years they have been heading to the Oktoberfest, and three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 pm.
When staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The journey costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, true to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And the buses are already rolling into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
It quickly gets quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
Well, they will still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates at the motorway 8 will take another break just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at half past seven watches in the parking lot near the Theresien meadow as planned, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gave a final speech, explains the schedule of attack.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it is on the left "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to it the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors rise to the beer tent, it means running!", Marco shouts in the morning.
"Living!" Running and occupy the pitches in the back of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we block, and not all yellowholds on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, Marco roars, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
"The security guards show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they are gone!"
Thirdly, "Today evening point half past eleven come here!" Understood?
And it's already possible to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as stamps to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
They want to be prepared for retreat.
It is the second weekend of wednesday, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no detailed information about figures; there is talk of 50 000 who make their way around the Alps and come to the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have travelled from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which is holding a nation statistics in which the Italians occupy first place ahead of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (around 80) with around 200 medical care.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, emphasised that Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück did not emphasise until last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also felt that the German banking sector was not spared the crisis-ridden developments.
Because that has now happened over the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is listed in Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only had to interest the part it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at subsidiary Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he lent money, the public financier had refinanced himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also fallen slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero year-on-year, income from attributory receivables and certain securities, and the reversal of provisions in the lending business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
The earnings of around 16 percent only thanks to higher income from refunds of downdown offset costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulations and from the tax provision for group companies had caused the yield to be moderate at around 16 percent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former sovereign financial authority had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been spun off in the Aareal Bank.
Because too little merit in classic state financing, Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to carry out depreciation for the value of the daughter, which will have a "significant material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it hot quite indefinitely.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
Already in 2007, it had been reduced by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing in the interbank market, as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has largely dried up as the banks hoard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance the loan portfolio of Depfa annually for a portion - around 50 billion euros.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets".
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to claim the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is hopeful for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is even unthinkable that the financing does not have to be used in full.
But the opposite is not possible.
After the bank was still about to insolvency late on Sunday evening, the at least preliminary rescue cannot reassure the minds.
The share price plummets by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are rightly good.
While the senior debt is rarely moved, the prices of subordinated bonds are more clearly in favour.
The bonds issued by the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the maturities that go beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds formerly a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the way with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments, and less ailing commercial banks are still ready to support the system, there may be a claim of pensions on a timely repayment.
Or this occurs, but what hardly anyone is currently daring to hope - that the financial crisis will be overcome over in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports covering partial nationalisation, the probability of certainty has only become a legitimate hope at the moment.
This should be possible, above all, to prepare some sleepless nights by deciding whether they should part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can at least use a final mark to form a loss charge for the future compensation tax payments on gains of later years.
German special forces were on site at hostage-free
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
According to the following, both Bundeswehr specialists and GSG 9 were the flying squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Department and logistics experts from the Federal Agency for Technical Relief.
However, as spokespersons of the ministries continued to tell on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostage participants ran and fled when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany in order to involve it as supporters on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had the tour group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on the 19th century. September in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been deported back and forth.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end, as did the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The saved have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not speak out about the release details.
In Berlin, there was initially no information on when they return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus from the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls start trying to try out: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a jew before the way to school.
I live towards Kawasaki on the edge of Tokyo and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn't get lost.
The start of lessons at Tachibana does not seem as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive from eight o'clock, until at twenty to nine a short meeting session begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lessons began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
But I am not the type who likes to talk to people, nor in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, with a blouse, blue knee-highs and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to speak everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week's birthday.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all snapped, giggled and absorbed, and constantly I heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew that from my manga.
It is part of Japanese girl's vital vocabulary and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly washed into my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found an honour that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally suffered.
Everyone talked about a mess and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - but it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all their Bentos unpacked.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - that's something different from the barren German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
Usually I don't have a pale glimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is certain that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty pickled plums, maybe brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy herself prepared bento, which she then prepares particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boys better during the break snack.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I am curious to see if I can observe this here.
'Why Japan of all people?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I then always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I have been reading manga for years.
And so that I understand the comics and the culture better, I started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
For me it was perfectly clear that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, customs and traditions.
And they place great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here either, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
US House of Representatives rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly failed the 700 billion dollar bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones rushed into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives has rejected the government's bailout for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties did not exist for the program to curb chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on the MEPs to approve even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he acknowledged.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was the investor concerns that the government bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to crash again after the failure became known.
Experts are now counting on further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required to enter into the programme.
Also rats have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in danger does it mean that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could one make sure they feel the same thing if they behave similarly to us?
The Internet magazine "E Edge" has been published for several years by contributions by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and touch questions of feeling or more common of consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it turns dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists indicate a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than with the other primates and seems to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature is probably due to the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, probably differed very much from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, neither measure nor, because of the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, its research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which should be scientifically more accessible.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is precisely what is happening in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially using the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick were addressed, one shifts to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the formation of visualization.
What does the sensations come about?
I argue that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain that is conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
From this point of view, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterise primates primates and, in particular, humans.
Combined with linguistic nature, subject to substance sharpness, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to ourselves as well as others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations emerge from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-genre sensations.
In purely theoretical terms, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unpretentious.
Panksepeep argues that what seems like fear in rats and people probably feel like it in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger if it feels fear?
In my view, mere resemblance to experience cannot yet prove an equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but scraping do not even have a brain.
But is the brainstem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this for people: how did you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I rather explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is waving at the neural level here, provided that the same is measured in rats and people.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, so also not sensations, I do not know whether they exist.
One may think that is short-sighted, but I would rather make progress rather than walk constantly against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Compromising period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to hold the European Championship together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is possible that the number of EM stadiums may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN association has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not capable of acting according to the rules," said Drzewiecki the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several first-department teams had been convicted of manipulation of forced downtown last season alone, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Organisers record increasing booking figures
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales in travel bookings for the coming months have increased significantly compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
According to a study, according to a study, despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire to travel remains untroubled.
When booking for the winter season, the travel offices recorded an increase in turnover of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the research institute GfK, there are already increased numbers of bookings for the autumn months.
The increase in travel agency sales for October amounted to around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
The basis for these results are figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is highly accountable for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Because of the weak dollar exchange rate, trips to the USA are particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the increase in bookings amounted to around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the local realms are particularly sought-after destinations with the Germans.
In particular, package holidays are superior to the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "easier for customers than on individually organised holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there would be an increase in sales again compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
Outrageous Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about Privates in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan edited her former Dennis Quaid as an adulterated.
The foams - and strikes back.
Delayed War of the Roses with ex-hukkaments Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now carrying out an unsightly dispute with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had expressed himself for the first time about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis have been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She only learned the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul triptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Boldish," said the 54-year-old the New York Daily News, that "Meg once again cheeks and resoaks the story of our relationship again."
It is also "regrettable" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "reminded about the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became the father of twins.
And so close his admissions with the side slash: "My life continues.
I consider myself fortunate that I have a wonderful family that is very popular."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels sink
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany even were up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have once again become cheaper - that is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and noticed a significant slump in the second quarter after prices in the first quarter increases.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities examined rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "decreasing desire for travel of American tourists" as reason for this.
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in the first quarter also showed the trend towards the top in air prices:
Due to the kerosene increase, travellers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices collapsed even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the prices have even halved on German domestic flights.
The reason for the price incubation is on the one hand the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market bröckele.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure through the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The strained situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes for airlines, as well as the large number of airlines that had notified bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, these were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV becomes the leader of the class.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working elf.
By Kristoffer Klein increase crash landing for international Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher did not come into play until late and failed with an elevator to the lath.
His message was precisely formulated, it went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew that he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was finished and most of them sat back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than many victories.
And so his request was heard in the place of responsibility.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his finger in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His order will have been similar: Her with Tor two!
The implementation was over.
"It wasn't everything to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it to be "relaxed".
The people of Hamburg owe the 1:0 (1:0) to the header hit of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class leader.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know classifying this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate certificate stands for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late-deluded accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric and the Jansen published by FC Bayern - they are slow to find themselves to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," Jol demanded.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless bow, beer made of litre jugs and celebrities in designer Dirndln.
A weasn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blond, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: Hardly three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers are already pouncing on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the Weißwurst equator, the well-being in traditional costume has still kept its limits.
But once arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather hoss; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the chocolate banana stand only harvests my dirnndl apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had mistied the apron: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, forgiven right, widowed in the back."
Secretly I frieve the loop from behind to the left.
"Fate," said it, laughing.
Others make less effort about subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the bare backside towards an uninformed.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "ooooo".
This is what he tells me after he has ridden himself of his previously drunk.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At an eight o'clock in the evening, paramedhites run in droves over the festival ground, who have to take care of the poor scrapers.
The nurses always perform in the pack - always four at once drag a covered carrying tent from tent to tent.
It works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, fully back.
If you are in the Promille coffin below the tarpaulin, you don't see.
"They are those where rabbitways grab," one of the paramedics shouted to me on request and disappeared in the turmoil.
After the voting defeat
Fear is about Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the bailout caused the Dow Jones to collapse by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within a day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
Around 8:30 pm, the world's most important stock market viewlisted, with a good five percent decrease at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was 1548, at more than seven percent decreasing.
The largest loser at this time was the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had acquired a stake in the company.
The rescue plan will provide the funds for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid out in one fell swoop, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option certificates from the financial companies, which could be cashed if the price development is appropriate, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in downwards
The billions in subsidies for banks in Europe and the US do not remedy the doubts of investors.
The share price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the Dax down.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular losses in Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have snatched the German Stock Index (Dax) deep into the cut.
Despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, the shares of the Munich real estate financier lost three quarters of its value, and Commerzbank fell by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped among the psychologically important 6000-point mark and noted at a decrease of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide, stock markets fell to their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s 700 billion dollar bailout could not be enough to get financial markets going back.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan that the vote in the Senate could be on 1. October.
The other European stock exchanges also only know one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex leading index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent, closing at 12,955,75 points.
In the MDax, Arcandor stocked after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed for the 23 million new shares.
The retail and tourism group also announced that the shares are not being sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon of research has caused perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory could not be quite right.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, it is now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion - the swing-by anomaly for years.
The swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, in which they receive additional swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprising for years, however, do not behave 100 percent as one would expect according to the time-honoured law of gravitation.
Rather, irregularities occur in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, may not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers in the universe have identified.
"The anomaly could be responsible for dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space explorers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously emanates from an attraction, the effects of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
Itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists Abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists deported in Egypt are to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The hijackers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
Six hostage-takers are said to have been killed in a shooting before the release.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Ransom negotiations are already scheduled to run.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media agree.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release following reports from the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are just reviewing their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting remains unclear before the release of the hostages: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the officer.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when "this surprise" suddenly came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the hijackers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the hostages were delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather have led to a woman killing herself, was reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithian, Cornwall, was six-yearly imprisoned after he had been suffering eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was about to be between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a confession, "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle was in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1 January. April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her before he performed sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, has been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "abandoned their lives"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she has killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confessional letter that ended: "I used to captivate her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't sexually composure her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely disconcerting fetishist and for their victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, the fact is that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so."
He added: "I note what effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, had their deed on their daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data will be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged according to the "Public Security Law".
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no reference to criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They thought that this would be dealt with internally with the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safekeeping of information.
The royal prosecutor's office recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he submitted contained classified evaluations of Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs
British housing associations could be in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers' deposits.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The general director of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the societies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest rates that have been accumulated in the meantime are counted each year to those 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The programme to compensate for financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully ... are now being called to cover some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that any company would have to pay relative to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest rates on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to raise 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, general director of the Association of Housing Societies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved carefully during the real estate upswing are now calling to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records were founded in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing associations and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates are due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since building companies are non-partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Turkey broadens diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deeply into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavour.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the travel guides tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about disintegrating
But once you are within the curved ticket office, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad company.
Germany, which was a late neighbour in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further out to what is Saudi Arabia today.
But Germany's imperialist plans were absorbed during the First World War.
His railway tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and urged the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly disintegrated, largely passed away from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling judicial and development party, the AKP, has introduced a lavish new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy trip on tracks that produced the old world's step in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project, the Ottoman past, to turn its back on.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused some mistrust in the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the head office of the AKP, a specially made, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-completed shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician of almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exceptional appearance," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays it has to look to the east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
It would have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could come," I asked, "will be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "do not want to have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke here with which everyone here reported almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey, the message seems to be, figuratively meaning, Europe as a whole can travel east-eastern rails towards Asia and the Middle East on the railways.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too largely, in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the pier for the ferry to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, at least, there did not seem to be much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk becomes five pence per liter more expensive
The people of Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale market price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milch last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is not paid
A court in Bangladesh has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's bailed application, which means that she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defence lawyers said that the court refused bail to extort 50 million Taka (about 729.700) from a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although their suspension was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to stay larger after returning to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The top court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says that she does not have to receive a bail granted, since she is already abroad for suspension of prison to be treated abroad," said her attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
We will make a legal complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers claim that they need deposit to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina after the 17th. October would return home, said an Awami alliance party leader on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go overseas for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated as a result of the violence associated with the Taliban, said the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of employees performing the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost his lawsuit against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share was distorting the competition and enabling him to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired his stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the competition authority reported that the purchase of the share in ITV by BskyB has ready doubts about the independence of the ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Office have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing the pressure of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he wanted to give up his voting rights.
New Investigation into the US Public Prosecutor's Saffia
The American Prosecutor General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the cancellation of the nine prosecutors in the USA in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticised.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious accusations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testified was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine US prosecutors from its offices in December 2006.
At this point, the ministry argued that prosecutors were dismissed due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, causing many observers to consider the dismissal to be politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of senior Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the allegations of Democratic electoral fraud.
US prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had come under fire because of the dismissals and ultimately resigned.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector's report critically addressed the role of Gonzales, by having "acquired" the "main responsibility" for the layoffs, "abandoned" his leading role and showing itself to be "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former main adviser to President Bush, Karl Rove, were criticised for the poor cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honoured
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured during the "Q Award" award for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize during the award ceremony next week in London, said he was honoured to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the track for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's award after being shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre, and that "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice supplied by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was surgery in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel concertos due to an acute laryngitis.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon for sale
New York City has thousands of major roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are just easily easily accessible.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime local residents, it is hard to say where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than after an actively used passageway road.
There are no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This road has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that she is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block's past.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in preserving it.
During a meeting of the council's land use committee this month, representatives of the municipal administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, said Susan Stetzer, the district leader in municipal council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the streets, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street will repay and set up seats that are intended for a café that the company wants to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but did not necessarily want it to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this dilapidated alley and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the building protection department, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department was to develop the properties rather than manage.
Compared with its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened up to Extra Place and the street is surely most known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public plot, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged scent of the city, which was to be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York" (signed with "The Book of Suits: A bitter nostalgic view of the dying city"), has published a part of the conversation between the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which even remains dark during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, sealed windows and waiting weekly newspapers passing by raincful ".
With a few exceptions, the street looked just like so recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the rear part of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where there is now a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were visible on the walls and an empty beer bottle was lying on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said that they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate about bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings
In this issue of the "Education Watch" discuss Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research assistant in Kalifonische studies and senior director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as one thinks: Why the middle class needs a selection of schools".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the likeness of African-American and Hispanic students successfully conclude school is lower than for white students" - which is true.
To close this downtime, Obama's educational plan recommends a bilingual transition phase in education, especially among others, for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008 amazing 100 percent students of the fourth grade passed the state examination in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English examination.
This amazing success has been achieved with methods other than those who are preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street school focuses on reviewing and exercise, constantly controlling knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach according to which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment. This is exactly the point that Obama is supposed to observe, according to head teacher Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches great importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist lessons.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only come from Mexico shortly before. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large number of Latin American and other English learning students?
The achievements of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (the national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions uncertain about Obama's answer.
While agreeing on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only."
Instead, he said, "You should make sure that your child can be Spanish".
If Obama actually wants to close the runtime, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices decrease as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of oil has fallen sharply on Monday due to the fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil futures on the New York retail exchange fell by 7 percent in the morning session to €99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than 20 dollars.
Over the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and by strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached their peak in July, they have fallen to nearly €90 per barrel in July, they've fallen to nearly €90 per barrel this month, then rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors showed concern again, even though Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a bailout plan over the weekend, which was to be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from being closed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government release on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have sometimes nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a bailout plan, it seems that the mood in the markets did not succeed.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is to be expected that demand for goods, among other things for oil will continue to fall.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe they are further writing that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The Bank's analysts have revised their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and have reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter mounted
Centre-back Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he ran up more often than anyone in the Jets jersey in the last eight and a half years.
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which was in the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect prelude to an afternoon that made her developing collaboration a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for another two touchdowns, which slipped one time as an outsider and the other times 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I didn't make a lot of effort," says Coles about the passes that went to Coles.
"He is a superplayer.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole played catches, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
Darrelle Revis hand-held defending an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last loss of the ball, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinal had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
Both of the answers, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said: "By believe, I have enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie beats its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some hold it for the best long-distance runner of all time, after he broke his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to make the distance of 42.2 kilometres in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat price in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus reached its 26th Set the world record in his varied career, where he has reached at least one world championship title on every route from one kilometre to the marathon or set a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie omitted the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that may have been exaggerated in retrospect that air pollution could aggravate its asthma problems.
Instead, he has registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrrichlassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Ever since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat switched from Kenya to long-distance race, the record time for marathons has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had convulsions in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously, he come back refreshed after a break and not rusted back.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed the training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end what's great."
He has been criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for excessively orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relies too much on the race leaders, as if that were a track race, and sets world records above the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the centre of the line in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had subsided.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last entry to part with Kwambai, who has arrived second in 2:05:36 and has improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, has ended a remarkable year by showing the seventh quickest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing, due to problems described as back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She sent a race by allowing a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to be ripped out first, but overtook after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived in the third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the strains in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Tucked between the excesses of the amusement parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glistening, loud and gigantic activity, lies a quiet city where the pride and the complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville come to commemorate the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city it describes – and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the federal scriptural project during the crisis – is and remains a place of very special kind in many respects.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what he misses."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential canon, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being observed by outsiders.
"We are very careful about how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident of the city and parish member of the city's oldest church.
It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is on the one hand a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on their hats.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five heels in the Florida guide changed the city, which is located very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the locations of black history and human drama.
Blessed as Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever suits hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men, who sang songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurtson is still remembered as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to town brewed, she did most of it without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that even today imagines something in its venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the residents were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Mr Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while rocking in his chair, on a rear-side terrace looking at Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was named most likely.
When Hurston died in 1960 she was poor and her books were sold out.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great commemoration, no public readings on a large scale.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against race mixing brought hatred into the community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the sitting aside," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston questioned in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by describing his decision in the Brown case against the school council as "offensive instead of respecting my race."
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group reunion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his adolescents.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they embraced your teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," says N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and Managing Director of the nonprofit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained, she added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You didn't hugged his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural chasm," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, the civil rights have contributed to room being created for more Zora Neale Hurston - black authors, actors and artists who defected prejudices, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set off to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much vowed Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway on the bookshelves, and made them again a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at exactly a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what could destroy the district with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revitalized the city, accelerating it at top speed, arousing real citizen's pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more people who had travelled, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando's city centre, she can sometimes feel like a back street in the summer rain, as small as when she was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders looking for the story of Eatonville and its meaning are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and hard-working, silly and mixed as any other group of races and peoples in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city government or with the police, who could use some help loudly.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only drive through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, they speak financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they would not even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoe-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst horror work day since the 1929 stock market crash every day.
The suppliers still push the metal tea trolleys along sidewalks with loud flaps and transport trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still shut around between apartments, such as human packing animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast baggage on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 pm and 7 pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the doomsday talks.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already queuing up.
Not at the money counters to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where nearest customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license," standing in line for the same reason as I was.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they were swinging, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little resembling a building society), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that have branches only in one state, and say that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets amounting to Ã327 billion, has been in bankruptcy administration and when Friday New Yorkers were going home over the weekend, Wachovia was another bank that owns savings worth four hundred billion dollars, looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and store workers who were in front of me brought their bare to a bank considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most bailout purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired a flowing financial Latin in the last few weeks.
A woman who spoke on the phone in my Chinese regular supermarket made reference to Lehman Brothers, the bank, and its sophisticated-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she were wandering over a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block has gone from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I don't go into any more risk."
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was "Tod" Handley (call on 11th. responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time were already some of us in late 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological mould changer) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been left for years.
How often did we think of "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never imperceptious but never exuberant.
However high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he directed the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can say sincerely that I was never disappointed by one person - often I was inspired by them.
Tod Handley was the rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, according to his words, simply "daughter with one or two known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25. September) write that "he regained teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and was awarded a Houblon-norman research fellowship in 1950... while at the same time he was studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from a certification of authors in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He served in the United States in 1950-1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated during right-hand slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing of the Austrian right-wing freedom party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take place on Thursday, 17. In January 2008, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamisation".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
The police accuse the right-wing extremists of the funnal administration in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend on which extreme right-wing parties made considerable profits in the country's parliamentary elections.
In the night of Friday this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun near Linz in a campaign organized according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but detectives consider this an attempt to conceal the motive of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" about the news of the tombing that took place when the religious month of Muslim Ramadan comes to an end.
At the same time, there is a round of examination of awareness in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the votes, were committed to a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their election slogans were criticised by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the vote, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even expressed his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of the continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which say that the extreme right is the strongest political bloc in the country, suggests that this new development is based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel closure for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been sentenced to the sexual abuse of children, was prohibited from court being sent to France and Spain.
Judge suspended Glitter for a six-month ban after informing the authorities in control of wanting to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were allowed to impose a foreign travel closure last Thursday after she presented evidence of glitter's criminal rejection of the sexual abuse of children to the judges.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25. On September, the police applied to Kent at the district court of Ashford permission to travel abroad by Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until the 25th of the day. to prevent March.
Paul Gadd was not present in person."
As required by the Register for Sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect the residents of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was to take a flight to London as planned.
But he said he did not feel comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and flew to Hong Kong after some.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, he came on the 22nd place. August at Terminal 3 at Heathrow and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for the permission to be able to request that he become a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been arrested in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
'I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no frills, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are worried because they are not entered the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents theatrics of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. He was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the Month of Photography of Flamenco, 'reflections the international importance of flamenco, which grows ever wider from day to day,' the artist explains and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be everyone, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people in the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience on stage.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the biggest flamen comet with the photo camera'.
In 1997, Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', set out on a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image sorting function and the existing material, images were created that are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, whereby the image is given the modernity and idea of how the farmer knows flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprises every day.'
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental playing itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of El FotÃata in the near future.
Well-known people in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of the almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer admits to 'I really like photographing people, getting to know them and putting me in their state of life, whether for a brief moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or come across people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of today's portraits of the flamenco, entitled 'Flamenco-people', is exhibited in the gallery of El FotÃ3mata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be found until the 16th century. October visit.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is 'a foolhardy'.
He does not yet know where the plot of the novel is taking place and what it is all about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project on which he is working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is engaged in is 'a foolhardiness' and 'everything indicates that he did not need to write the novel'.
'If I were prudent, I would not have done it, but I will do it and I hope to finish the novel at some point,' so he completed his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the premium of the Hay Festival and which gives most of the attendors their voice, is compared to the old edition of 'Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and stated that he had an audience in front of him, who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a feeling of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which wanted to complement "exteem" from 'joy,'numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, VÃ3ctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appointment and what 'memory pictures' are that form the basis for his stories.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that there is 'no way' what you can measure and where you can know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,' stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it 'evokes effects' and 'makes people even more apart', therefore I asked the writers.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play along: bullfighting festivals were partly eliminated.
After the announced bullfighters noticed that the ground of the place was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to be completed by the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, for example, with the agreement of FermÃ3n BohÃ3rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was subjected to the volatile weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it was raining, which is why the second intended bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro DÃ3as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut and triumphed three ears, after whom he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After flying so badly, much of the audience reacted in his second fight with boo calls.
In Ã...lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Morning: five minutes ago ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of ArmiÃ3on (lava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, after which they took flight.
It looked like whether they would not have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Interior Ministry of the Basque state told.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and forgery official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the lava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armicon.
You decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometres. At that moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road to a forest area.
The city police from Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2.178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later led to the exact laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles to other police departments.
In addition, the officers noted that the license plate was 'double', so it did not match the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why there was an additional arrest for counterfeiting official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continued the investigation to make the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to escape, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police station for interrogation. He will be brought before the detention judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the action of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, who is known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the action of an unknown medication.
A witness had observed how she tried to sail out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokesman for the traffic police of California reported the magazine 'People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear 'said accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forward out of the parking space, and when she drove backwards, she picked herself at her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the witness who at first the actress probably had not recognized that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and got off at the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'feared around Locklears'.
When the police patrol came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thereby blocking the traffic.
'She seemed disoriented,' so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol centre to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was expelled from the first moment. 'Consequently, the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medication,' said the speaker.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined, and taken to local pre-trial detention at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona Clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Federation of the United Left becomes responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and deputy of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sports of the city hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must assume jurisdiction for it,' Llamazares pointed out what action the party must have against him who is still sitting in the municipal council of Seville as a city council.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva might have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the formation has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
'Sangre de mayo': Hero Book of Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez GaldÃ3s, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish Uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with around 15 million euros investment for shooting.
In this way, the cineast tried to represent "a crowd of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula EchevarrÃoa at the beginning of a long list of the actors.
'Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later shown on the telemadrid channel as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of literature by GaldÃ3s, assures that thanks to this shooting, his 'childhood dream' went into fulfillment. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid, a commemorative film for the second celebration of the century on 2nd year. November to turn in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on 'Episodios Nacionales', it adopted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he had suggested, offers the 'unique opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, which selected the wrong leader for the struggle for the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.
However, the cineast regrets that the financing as in 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as at 'Sangre de mayo') couldn't be shot, so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garcia worked almost his entire career, could not be shot.
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in 'Volver a empezar', has worked through his ordinary working method: he stood on stage to the actors with whom you have to rehearse first before you start shooting and for those who had not done a casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and gaining respect, 'a part of the film director's profession is to help in the theater.
Many actors he encounters in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos LarraÃ3aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Academy candidate in four nominations (of which one he has won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represented Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year will be a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected movie 'Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
'At the beginning you think you're working for the descendants, later you realize that it's only for the flourishing, and now you're satisfied if you've still produced a film'," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional work.
Isabel BayÃ n recalls the memory of the dancer from Sevilla TÃ rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen TÃ3rtola Valencia: her father was a Katalane (FlorenÃ3 TÃ3rtola Ferrer) and the Mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel BayÃ n fascinated Isabel BayÃ n, the life of this woman, who has left her mark on the revolution in Europe's dance and aesthetics revolution in time between the wars.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell about her life, but preserve her esprit,' said the Flamencot dancer.
Their dance bases helped me a lot in flamenco.
'The dance of the butterfly seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or 'the dance of the snake' like tango.
Their dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production counts with two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in 'La puerta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together with one of her ex-students for once.
"Matilde plays TÃ3rtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also counts with musical composition and the guitarists JesÃos Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de MorÃ3n; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola by Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra JÃ3arez, he 'takes the role of the accompani of the artists who were who were always in love.
In this work, one also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, which became known in places as widely as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
'I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works no one today knows less and therefore even less appreciate them,' BayÃ3n claims.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They alerted me to them because of their simplicity and because of the strength they radiate, how they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan RamÃ3n Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers an atmosphere to carry out planned activities commissioned by the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the Zenobia and Juan RamÃ3n' (2006-2008) church. The goal is the memory of the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
For example, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan RamÃ3n' will be concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan RamÃ3n Jiménez-Zenobia and the travelling exhibition 'Juan RamÃ3n Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and now in Andalusia.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred specimens of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The US can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in 'Sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing performance of the American cinema, which was stabbed, came from all of America to Newman with his inspiring performance and followed her.
Look at what it cost her to give him Oscar.
And when he withdrew in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
'What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the greatest resentments of his life.'
No one was afraid to avoid making himself ridiculous or exaggerating.
As 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment, in which there is fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in which the US Americans' depressed self-esteem is in the hopeless search for reasons to get back dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue there are only a few people to admire, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses both profits: from the foundation, which was dedicated to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of home-conservated and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it took a lot of effort to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement beats to take up hails over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Academy Award winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the greatest of all of us,' confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to live today trying to live as Paul Newman lived: to maintain high demands on righteousness, lead a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who tries it, and Paul Newman was an example of this.
He divorced once and then married Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities for not being.
"What should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?', he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on Earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles he played, none of him was as proud as of that of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and the philanthropist, they say.
The streets of Madrid are lacking for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself: 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and according to my judgment, it was the worst road with everything it all happened.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if one were to consider the evaluation and I could consider it, something would clearly not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with ticket fetching, which allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad to me, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including the chip to avoid the traffic jams on the street).
So not.
Here they only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which consists of going there only because of that) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it the case that after the crisis was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So good, things like this are a little thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack lying.
The waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it could be expected, the street started and we did not leave our backpacks in front of it, even if it had been possible, but it would be more difficult to get back.
In addition, it looked like these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so it was tempted to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people of pneumonia and some like me will appear because of this chip I have received, not even in time at the classification, I can already think that the outcome has been stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if I were to be asked for a perfect road, this road would never come up with me.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but it is capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move around the company's campus). The system pays attention to what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify those present in groups after conversations.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' records a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group who talks with her, and that there is no company employee either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and responds that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better stuff to focus on, for example, on the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week, they talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the bare essentials instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be only for the few.
Everything is only a finding considering that Microsoft incorporated one or two versions into Windows versions and 'extras'.
The change of direction is worthwhile
This Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing its importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have skiled indicate that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can function simultaneously.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That is true.
The system will never disappear, but one has to think of one's 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the 'window' environment.
What is half of the applications for in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so excessive, less complicated.
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need this, without doubt. I bring a small example of this.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: "Your search. Our future.' It prints a request to use your own tool for search online.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google, used Google for research on the net.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 is in delay.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the Mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso has done it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Goddess' of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is part of the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the countless star performances, we can return to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard who had raised heavyweights in a travelling circus.
Basically, this is a typically male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in its narrow circle. Legend has it that the origin of the name is associated with sports and comes from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' towers over all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable), which these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company does not only focus on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, trousers made of cotton, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a great pity to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
Second round of the excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda captures with the marketing of the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-capacity limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical details, which enable even more comfortable driving and saving petrol.
Changes before the impending revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that were made in this large saloon are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasised.
Nevertheless, before it begins to analyze the new model, it should be said that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars. That is 17% of the assumed growth in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002. That is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of models, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sale lowering in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models. That is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is focusing on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact 4.7 meter in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The publication of the Insight in the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its greats.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 metres, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, whereby, does not change and remains 1,52 meters.
Along with the increase in the dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due on the one hand to the new room flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
The capacity of the boot, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, including the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only having 67 degrees.
The second generation of Jazz's engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque performance for the entire engine running time.
The first variant with 1.2 litres achieves the output of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz achieves 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp for the previous generation, it is now managing to achieve 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister, did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
MÃ3nica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
The Gruz siblings are currently taking their new activity in fashion very seriously.
This means much more for MÃ3nica than for some pretty and rich girls who maintain their reputation.
She was in Paris with the promotion of Mango, moves to this place and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Kind and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner in Valentino's honor.
A very intensive working time, which is at the same time exciting.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you are a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe yes, but after all, everything meets in one and these areas have many similarities.
Since I was little, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to stir up my aunt's clothing cabinets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in lessons and rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, have you fallen into no crisis?
Oh what.
I feel better than ever, I feel good as thirty-year-old.
I think the woman is ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological watch.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was little, and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, do you think of becoming a mother, or not?
I have known for a long time that I become a mother, because it demands my body and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and educate it with a lot of love.
As for the art of cinema, you keep in mind the works you participated in and which were shot last year.
That is exactly what it is and I very much want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and wants to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much wish that 'La 'ltima hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see you like
A few days ago you appeared on the climb with Naomi Campbell, is that true?
It's good, don't say something like that.
It's not that I went on the course to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called me and invited me to take part in a parade for the charity of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our Mango collection were auctioned to raise the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are many things about them. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they are not true.
Nevertheless, I will support this good cause in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous matter, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
'Auto-bees' avoiding collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an expansion of the four-pous Nissan security shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet-face eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows her to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to recreate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles that are up to two metres at a distance of up to two metres before the BR23C and are within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signals for avoiding the collision
"At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasive manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not so, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory of Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bee, the robot can neither deviate up or down, but also not covered; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and infinite way, as the bees make it.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
"This device needs only every few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require neither the information nor the intuitive logic of manoeuvres to be stored, so it can continuously work with only a couple of tens of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesied to introduce to the next decade at the production cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal while driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
The drivers who can become back due to the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders the driver, who had three official penalties because of the alcohol level, installed this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in the drunken condition. If it is alcoholic, the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to her, this is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver, which is why he receives a course for re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the Prosecutor General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 3075% of drivers who were reported more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol, they got back to the tax.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system associated with the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents car start when the driver has taken alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration is determined that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than EUR 1 000, the costs will be borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these equipment prevent 65% of the violations of the rules in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it is a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, law-based reform can be realized by ordinary means, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is being called for, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still not available in any business in the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, of all places, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the programme, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México Airport, landed the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias, landed.
The sun went down, but its rays have still forced her hand to use as a parasol to see the royal pair who got off the plane.
Directly at the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other Authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people with you at this time at this time you are from here or so
No, she is the Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 marine soldiers who hand over honour salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary 'peep-toes', maybe you were told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the room, they smile and are prepared for the photographers waiting for the official retinue.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television is waiting for her, who likes to joke.
It is trembling before being charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognised that the US Treasury Department has adequate liquidity to provide support, but not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid US citizens being involved in mortgage stories of the supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game has been developed for the Internet surfer: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamlike room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there were probably no significantly outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivanten than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el B'ton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and international increase in young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the mango branch's shop showcase on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris yesterday and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a retail space of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with the fact that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship in the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the area of many famous people, the board table, organized by Mango, seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart which was broken by pain because his brother died recently, tear himself together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry from ELAH that were breathtaking. He held on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two metres in size and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honour.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, greeted the guests and was such a gentleman, so that he ended up with the Baron von Rotschild without jacket, because they lent the ladies.
MÃ2nica Cruz, has rushed to business and had trousers and a shirt, which she herself modelled, and to the dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got up excited, remembered the old days, reached a pole and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the cell phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martinez, a personality that always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed lacquers and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the star-filling sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And even if there are few, everyone is collected in a book where it is ready to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on 30. September.
The alarm is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands is coming in even worse, seems even worse.
The office is the tension and the computers leading to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21. century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and problems of how to switch off from the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book presents the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress means '1001 possibilities to relax' and so the peace that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve calm in areas such as work with the help of personal contacts, this manual disproves such beliefs.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes proposed that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins does not rise to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, switch off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it comes to you for the first time, in the best case you will be frightened, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder, which is called speaking during sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ), the child cannot remember anything the next day.
There is no reason to create this phenomenon.
Often searches for connections with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panicky fear at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fibrous, stressful situations or excessive demands.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks, whispers, whispers, or it can be quite an opposite (shouting, weeping, long discussions ).
In cases when the statement is very intensive, it is recommended to observe the child and to seek advice from a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus comes about.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to arouse the child before sleeping.
So, quiet game for the child to avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and a bit too wild.
For nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
If speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, and you will snatch it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, he falls asleep, so he rests.
Remember, if it is scared after a few appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what reason the child has for fear.
When they understand what they say (which is not so ordinary), does not put pressure on the child to carry out an interrogation and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because if the child sleeps, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, so they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's not bad, that's a moment that takes only a few minutes.
Illhäuser ... finally
After a long streak, Illhäuser is finally on the road to success on the pitch.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks achieved numerous scoring chances and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, during which the attackers had trouble showing their skills, was not very high.
After an initial attack by guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot narrowly passed by the angle, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it was first taken a turn of Fonderflick with a long gun, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the centre of the field and allowed only the lively Riahi at the peak of the storm.
The beginning of the second half was to be decisive with two scoring chances fought for by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was just right to accept a ball that had been fended off in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Lenin-holy goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which means that his teammates had to continue to play in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any great problems with a letroleum eleven, which only withdrew a little to 'condense' its defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the bare after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fisherman
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen, who blocked the entrances to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to arrive in the port of Guilvine in the FinistÃ3re on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hope that he will come with 'concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general assembly of the crisis committee founded by the Breton fishermen to take action in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record of more than €1.14 per litre.
According to the press officer of Elysée Palace David Martinon, the president will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies to return to become competitive and secure job conditions and the payment of seafarers.'
Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in the Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometres in length.
The Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ile did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was separated by a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors gave their determination expression by burning ripe and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec crisis committee must decide on the response to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give in on any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris,' announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The occupational fathers who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful

AIG would consider making more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday's edition, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the US monetary authority, is considering issuing more than 15% of its assets, in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were earmarked for him.
AIG is willing to promote the sale of much of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at the AIG.
The assets from which AIG may be separated include its International Lease Financial Corp. aircraft lease branch, its 59% insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, continues the FT.
No final decision has been made with regard to these sales, the FT continues.
AIG needs to make the sales as quickly as possible in order to repay the loans of 85 billion that it has approved the Federal Reserve, including at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and that current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777,68 points to 10,365.45 points.

After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to allow some stability in the markets again, Wall Street, which was already hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against it, and 205, the deputies refused to provide the financial secretary, Henry Paulson, with the means he had asked for.
Almost two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
'This is a bad picture circulating that presents Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,' said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come 'too late'.
"If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will quickly task the Fed (the American Central Bank, note. (Red.) and other central banks to get the crisis under control, which would limit the credit terms even more,' warned Brian Bethune, head of economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed that she emphasized the feeling of utmost urgency even more, "that every day that passes, 'with it's the ruin of a financial company in the United States.'
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the banking transactions of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency response to banks in the UK, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing 'not only of an American but a global crisis', the analyst added the FTN Financial.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The government treasury's revenues within ten years have fallen from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday night, and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Morgan Stanley makes their capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong case of its stock market price.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a single price of 25.25 dollars, representing a total of three billion dollars.
The assumed price is less than 19% of the share's share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars around 17.00 GMT.
'This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director General of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which will allow it to extend its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply declared that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about 8.5 billion dollars.
'A week ago', in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, we thought that the interest would be made entirely of common shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price value for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will be paid by a reduction in earnings by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter is replaced to more than 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. to approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds delivered by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press secretary of the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
According to the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a payability rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan declared that he had 'significantly' lowered his record since the end of August.
The last few weeks were tough for the group, who had to watch their stock market price fall by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency skyrocketed.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only 'survivor' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had raised 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic for Socialism of the 21. New founding around the old century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian resident Rafael Correa.
It was the third who, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, this Sunday, put the plan for a new constitution.
Mission is fulfilling, because according to the public results encountering 80% of the vote voted, 64% voted by 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballot papers were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
For the constitutional project to be adopted, one vote must be reached more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polls and a counting of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and had predicted 63% to 70%.
By the way, Rafael Correa had called for the victory of his constitutional project on Sunday to Monday.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the observational order of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism', which the President is committed to.
The constitutional project transfers state authority to the economy by leaving its sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives as far as possible from oil production by foreign companies and from the foreign currency, the emigrants send to the country.
The project, which is being driven by Correa, is also granted broader power to the head of state, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the president has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on using an equatorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner after points in the first television duel
The first debate between the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another one to find out who emerged victor, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this televised duel for election to both the Republicans and the Democrats, which was to be followed by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although respectful, was not 'brilliant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion poll on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly cutting the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, those who are now coming, Obama emerged as the winner of the polls at 39%, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
"It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but this weekend warned Bill Clinton.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to focus his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, thus clearly underlining his opponent's 'nativity' on these questions, which formed the center of this first television duel.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he stressed several times.
'I don't believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,' he also assured.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican campaign spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being disturbed.
He drew his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has from the United States.
'McCain still has not understood, Obama has already understood," this weekend, a democratic campaign spot against accusing the Republican of not having covered the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the 'American off the street'.
'During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain at an election ceremony in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle class' or 'workers'. The financial crisis gives Obama, which Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The coming week could be a decisive turning point,' yesterday estimated the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the final ruling of an eight-year-long poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.'
After rethinking that he would even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, Illinois Senator pointed out that creating a potential energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, had a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates strongly avoided the questions that are based on the plan to save the financial market of more than 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress yesterday evening and is extremely unpopular with the people.
'Did you notice that an election was taking place in Minsk?'
Young people and opposition members demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians have gathered on Sunday evening since the polling stations closed in the Minsk marketplace to protest the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator is to resign.'
Some admit that they didn't choose at all: 'What use is that when they do whatever they want with my voice anyway,' says a young person.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best light, is prepared to resume negotiations with the European Union.
The sanctions, including the non-depositing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian figures and the establishment of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting," regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewitsch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and here is the executive.
When representatives of the opposition merge into parliament, it is because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition therefore guilty to interfere in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognise the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout figures seem too high, and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
"Did you notice that an election has taken place? asks the leader of the social democrat Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in parliament, those most likely to meet the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night descends again over the October Square.
President Lukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate themselves on television for their success.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command took off the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who were captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
The hostages reached the al-Maza military base directly next to Cairo International Airport around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter, to the hospital of Maadi, a aliens neighbourhood of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid a ransom,' said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the tarmac.
After she was on the 19th September safari was captured at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from 35 unknown hijackers from one hiding place to the next.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special forces, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night just before dawn.
'Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remaining floated,' said the person responsible, who wants to remain anonymous.
He said that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently located, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special forces,” he said without further details.
He also spoke that a ransom had been paid.
On the eve of the night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle during a patrol, in which there were hijackers, killing six of whom, including the leader from the Chad, and two arrests.
The army said that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which, however, immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate about financing culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will get up and denounce the wretched sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites which starve miserably?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no real laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that there are no right laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is making 3.5 million euros available solely for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours state written in the constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of parliament and all administrative districts, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the union of Quebec's historical societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 history societies are trying to work intensively on history, saving a few pennies the numerous private archives, and preserving the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers let go of their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Discentre - The Blood That was Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th yesterday. Anniversary of its founding, and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which was severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves administered by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public discontent, the Canadian government launched a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to draw up guidelines to prevent another catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to submit his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time, whose aim was to develop a new system for managing blood canned food in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this order.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood canning system in Quebec, Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and work in this field over the following years, we have regained public confidence,' she says, before proudly emphasizing that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, retains in the knowledge that 'trust is something very fragile'.
Since its foundation on 28. September 1998 Hema-Quebec acts on the principle of caution.
At this time, we experienced the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new species of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, there was no blood on people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted over the blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used makes sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the donor's blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The Art enabled to shorten the incubation period between the time when the person was infected and which, if the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, explains the specialist.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not see this, has been significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed to significantly reduce the risk of transferring AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of obtaining HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood cans have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 bloods every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurring in which HIV was transmitted via a blood cannot be used.
I believe that nowadays you can feel comfortable if you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health,' says the head of the director of Hema-Quebec.
"Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects via blood.
We must monitor continuously, drives Dr. Décary continues before stressing that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care in addition to a secure supply.
"The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since the treatments to fight cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which includes only 3% of Quebec's residents, which are suitable for blood donation. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the suitability criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they are suffering from AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from leaving blood for one year.
"With these 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow older and no blood can be provided.
It is difficult to persuade people to donate blood, but above all to keep them and get them to become a regular donor.
Nowadays, life is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour of blood donation,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively for severe burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only Quebec public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, which was formerly considered biomedical waste, contains abundant blood of stem cells, which can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukaemia.
"A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand every year.
'We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year,' explains Dr. Décary further, which describes this program of umbilical cord blood acceptance as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced that they have no access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 too 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals) against the sounders from Seattle in the second and decided to win the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall gate ratio was held, qualifying for the semifinal round of the elimination matches of the USL First League.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the nintieth minute.
After a first half without goal for both one and the other side, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in Matt Jordan's way for the Sounders.
Let us remember that the first game of the pre-and-return series on Friday's Friday Impact had earned the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still moved to the semifinal round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will have to face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to tackle the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit, formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn, pushed the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev turned a passport into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolore in six preparation games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, warned the Russian.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. '
"He has fixed himself too much on it in the first half, Guy said carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. '
Charest relies on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule to launch elections before the end of the year.
Once the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (Left) tried to be elected in today's partial election.
'Poverting our last major boundary in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Quebec Party in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three giant screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, seen from Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large means as during the electoral period.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to exclude from the press that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he announced that his schedule was very full.
The North Plan is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' providing for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has recently been mentioned frequently in the Prime Minister's speeches, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, any investment amounts or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At most some of the outlooks on what could be done more about: in particular, on water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to the list of Mr. Charests, the north owns 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This 'area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is in us,' he stressed how to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national start-up dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added, after he had embarked a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the Quebec area, includes a portion of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister told the press.
"This is a traditional attitude that all governments have pursued.
There is a borderline where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity arises I will resume this position in the name of the government,' he said.
In addition, 'with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the north,' he explained and spoke about the northwest passage, which will be passable all year after the melting of ice.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former partisan deputy of Ungava) have already started discussions on some thirty communities.
A committee of ministers headed by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) occupies an important place, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where 'you will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also proceed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be 'proceded, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it was a continuation of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
"Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have been rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development chanchairs.
This, by the way, was one of the repeated themes of the weekend, which on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary. Anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage was opened.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the renaming Beauharnois power plant to Adélard Godbout dam.
'From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' explained Jean Charest.
He referred to the press to another, this time conservative project, namely the 'Roads to the North' program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper Hydropower Dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
'That remains among us, but I intend to be there', he entrusted his party members, which caused those storms of applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly also in 2009, do not yet have the opportunity to hold an election this autumn, which is possible for it from the law, not yet excluded.
He stresses that his calendar is full, however, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the Weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'the Constitutional objectives', which were readily adopted: The PLQ demands particular recognition of the 'Ec Quebec's particular feature in the constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Councils, and that they veto the decisions made in Quebec.
The guidelines of Plan North were sceptical from the opposition.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has brought out the policy for the development of the North Du Quebec, which the government introduced in 2001 by the Landry government.
According to it, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, 'we would already be a lot to go ahead, said Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Francoise Mercure.
ADQ has said it was in favour of supporting the government's adoption of a plan North.
'But what we want is that this will not only be a big show,' said party leader Sébastien Proulx, representing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonourable land
It was Mr. Vic Toews, ex 'Justice' Minister (whoever irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration, so to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as it is about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which has not brought home from all the countries affected by their compatriot, who was caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even consider that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things happened to him that happened to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to be vegetated under inhumane conditions.
The only one who is lowered into a lack of justice to assess the fault of the defendant.
Let us remind you that UNICEF in particular, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are calling for bringing Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that it turns a blind eye to torture: it is little interested in it that a young adult will certainly be broken mentally after so many years.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality anymore: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and detain a Canadian citizen, according to the spirit of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he after the 14th day). October belonging to the minority...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party preaching virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17. In September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic that the world's largest gold extraction society sought a slander action against six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening up a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of slander complaints, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of its opposite opinion.
No matter how the trial comes out, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defenses and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic of these unequal fights is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement that silences the opposite side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things to the public opinion.
By contrast, in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through club blows.
It would therefore have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams, which could have put light on this question.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a gesture.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, yet disregard the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice President, this word only includes the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a pretty cramped view of the term.
In a democracy, even depressions have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public supporting the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is prepared to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many see as a clasp a claim (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they require them to stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and truth-finding, which are fundamental to any democratic society.
It fully denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long known how to get grip on debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it dictates, it does not feel like a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take action that restrict this kind of unjustified lawsuits.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans Goet
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike finally came to an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion US dollar plan, which is to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaken Wall Street for months, still has to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new dispositions to contain the number of houses attached due to arrears, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executive employees of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative, Senator Judd Gregg, who was present at the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,' said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
'Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street,' said the Democrat.
'This is the basic point: if we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,' explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, fearing the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates who participated in the negotiations were more likely to be in favour of the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction at the fact that they must be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain dispositions to reach agreement, especially those that are intended to enable owners to keep their homes, and those concerning the salaries of the executives of the state-rescued companies.
"If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponement of certain people, that is not what to congratulate oneself on.
But these measures are necessary,' he said on the American television channels.
When asked on another station if he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republic opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
"The principles I have read, that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is geared towards taxpayers' money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before spreading to further forms of spread bonds (PCAA), and eventually leading to a freeze of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed the first attempt to reach an agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic's assets of societies should only be secured and not bought by the government, and are not to be bought, they believe they are escaping the impasse.
To top the viewpoint for everyone in Congress, it has also been added an injunction that says that if the government with this program should make losses within five years, it could then collect new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of an initial sum of 250 billion, which can add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of a further 350 billion must be adopted by the Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that pay it in the event of profits and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to halt the attachment proceedings relating to the properties subject to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and will also set deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the executive employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, other votes were raised yesterday against this plan, both on the Republicans and the Democrats.
'Obviously, Washington doesn't understand us,' said the Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Commission, his voters.
"Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to ask taxpayers to pay.'
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called 'the skepticgues', presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
'Four hundred and four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to be put under pressure and carefully consider which path to go,' he declared yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again demonstrated that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great difficulty since it lost EUR 2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) in crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate we obtain the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households estimate, now that uncertain times are announcing. '
During this time, the British government was in the process of nationalising another bank, which was in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take all ongoing loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion (USD 75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to Northern Rock to nationalize by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925/2008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from a narcissistic mirror with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the really terrible monsters.
But what a great permanent runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, as a result of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the he golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to which he resembled and for which he was a kind of rival on the screen for a long time, more carefully in his play, and certainly also fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the explosive dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the glorious faces of the American dream was to be created from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, very quality feature.
Because in him a whole country reflected in love with the self-made-man, the fighter who was injured in the Battle of the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited Actor's Studio in New York before success in theater, television and soon in the cinema.
It was precisely this man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he and the actress Joanne Woodward had been living in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrained, committed stars, which are oversensitive to the glamour of show business, whose puzzles will never be completely solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused the cinema lovers to drink this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in constant change pulls over with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) comes into mind again, and the young man, who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Die Katze on the hot tin roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter reminder (1990) is called awake, which was said to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of its promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Handful of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, after whose death it was resumed and made the Newman correctly known in 1956.
This sympathetic crook in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
As embittered and vengeful billiard players in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through time was he.
Still he.
Eras are united in his curriculum vitae.
The youth know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the few orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes joined the circle.
Unlike several cinema legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman was to stay in the saddle for a long time, revealing Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as a living challenge to 'undererplaying' when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: a neurotician, alcoholic, fish ring or desperate, with the perfect representation of which he reflected his slipping and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
At the flood of honours yesterday about Newman, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: 'His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's drift, is now gone.
We often see it with the foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, standing in sauces, pastries or other foods, and this considered it quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from its turnover nevertheless flowed into its foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman got involved to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: "Always and until at the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honour to be here. '
And it was an honour for us to be able to pursue the lives of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and in the broadest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of surcharge & etc.?
On the 8th The negotiations begin in the criminal trial against Jáno's slaunch and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendants are accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including counterfeiting of documents.
According to the public prosecutor, the funds raised from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered with forged invoices.
State funds and subsidies from local government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to have been partly included in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly in the private funds of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender funds received, and the associations are not to have fulfilled their duties.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were falsified.
The billing blocks were purchased on the market of JÃ3zsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on the round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by Jáno's surcharge.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados guesthouses and restaurants should be located.
He demanded invoices about consumption in order to issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These calculations are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Cri, whereby the latter is said having been responsible for the Constitution of the relevant reports, according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer restaurant.
As can be seen in the invoices issued by the award and Co in 2003, the restaurant business is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company states that such a large group did not fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Ã...vezredért, also showed serious formal and content errors.
According to the calculus, 130 guests are said to have stayed in a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate more than ten people at the same time.
There were obviously no limits to the imagination of the calculation counterfeiters when it came to Pigal Kft., a restaurant business, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövért and Hoppá did not appear in the first place, according to the prosecution authority.
As managing director GyÃ3zÃ3 Farkas of the hvg.hu told him immediately that these were falsified documents when the prosecutor's office were presented to documents by the public prosecutor during a questioning.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company is said to have hosted one hundred people, after having a total of eleven rooms, which impossibly offer space for so many people.
Catering was also listed on the invoice, and the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The busy bill counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency targeted by them offers travel exclusively for travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment invoice, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As has become known in the course of the investigation, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The amount of the VAT was wrong to four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfolder Kft to the Jobb JövÃ3ért Foundation, since the company accounts for only 15 percent of VAT instead of 25, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the counterfeit documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made to the "invoice depositors" was that they had indicated "transport of goods" as a service provided in a case, although this is not offered by the company specialising in investment consulting, the public prosecutor's office informed.
It was also thanks to the lack of form - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - that the one at Együtt a Harmadik Ã...vezredért AlapÃ3tvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued invoices could be exposed as counterfeits.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp KunfehértÃ, whose managers recognized that they never issued the bills.
Another "mistake" is the forgers at HIB Kft. from Nyregyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager there was therefore stated that the bills did not issue the bills themselves.
Consciously fake
The other group of accountants are individuals who were well aware that they would have to lay fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - IfjÃ3 Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért AlapÃ3tvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Ã...vezredért, at the level of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional accounts.
Biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with a contract and co.: In 2003, the management company is scheduled to have provided the workplace job company Jövért AlapÃ3tvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and VörösfenfenyÃ1⁄2 Egyesület with counterfeit invoices.
However, there was also no payment transactions, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issue, but these concerned were forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of invoicing owners includes persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta TriÃ1⁄2 Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of HUF around 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, the since the 14th edition is to be s Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas acted as the buyer of these invoices on September September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to which the company documents were also delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov had been in the investigation during the investigation to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Ã...vezredért AlapÃ3tvány and their equivalent value themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which, according to the defendant, was due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned to prepare the company's founding documents, he issued invoices to the clubs associated with a contract on behalf of the companies, such as Atlasz and Y-Generácic.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices with a total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The public prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT.
Kubatov is even said to have misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case the invoices were enclosed with the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-GeneráciÃ3 and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály AlapÃ3tvány ("TMA").
Both each received 500,000 forints, but have used these amounts foreign use.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictitious invoices to the TMA of Works Team Kft..
By the way, these calculations were ensured during the search of the office of Ã...rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some of the defendants are now expected to confess on the procedure of forgery for accounting, as had already been taken before the public prosecutor's office.
One sensation could be if the main defendant Jáno's bid decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous data were less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a contract is prepared to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that the supplement is now playing the "Being offended" after his requests had fallen on deaf ears to be met with mitigating the detention and house arrest.
While other criminals who have caused much greater damage with economic offences and have not remunerated them are released, or at least under house arrest, supplementary supplement is denied this possibility.
The psychology of surpassing - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the filing bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to admit defeat in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play the lottery, while the other took part in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the opponent's surpassing plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to underpin their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted investigations to track money.
In this case, three groups were supposed to be against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was notified of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group were also promised 15 dollars reward, in case they emerge from the game as winners.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis on one winning, while the other was losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing against the "loser" were prepared to attend higher stakes than those in the control or "win" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any earlier economic theory.
Until now, these have only justified the behaviours observed at auctions with the joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to see?
Worldwide, around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at a hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread to two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, through the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
In any case, travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are about two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and eyes, the stool becomes light, urine becomes dark, and recovery can last for two-three weeks.
Worldwide dies around 1 million annually. People in those induced by hepatitis B, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people are in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells insidiously - in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who undergoed a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can already be detected during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Detected in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, whereby the risk of infection is banished and prevented the development of cancer.
The 30. September is World Hepatitis Day, and in 2004 is organised by patient representatives worldwide for the first time.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Benelux governments national parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which have been caused by the US financial crisis, to the Belgian-Turkish bank: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions made in connection with the bank could now have preceded terms.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its shareholdings, above all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis began a sharp decline last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios have already become apparent.
However, analysts agree that the Bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large for a bankruptcy.
The securities of the Institute fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to management, the USD 700 billion American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is to blame for the downward of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the Bank's new Director General.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested parties with an objective offer.
The Belgian government, however, tried to calm down - no investor should tremble for his money, it was said.
Among customers, no panic has so far broken, the bank's branches were not stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also lists leasing companies its own.
Do believers have less pain?
As latest research findings show that religious faith works as a kind of "painkiller" that is said to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent belief in God influences human pain feelings, reported the British sheet "Telegraph".
In the course of the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists were shocked with electrically while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it could even be shown that the Catholics could activate the part of their brains, which is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, the test subjects were tied a sparkling device to the left hand, which caused the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century. century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while selecting da Vinci's painting because it was hardly distinguished from the other painting and was perceived as reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while either looking at the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics said that at the sight of the Mother of God they felt "in certainty" as if they were "concerned", and they had felt "quiet and peace."
During the viewing of the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that one could also cause similar effects with other, strong-acting images in the atheists, one would only have to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that creates very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practising faith should change our personality, and in many cases it does," says Wright.
After these outstanding results, only the effect of a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter on the pain regulation of the faithful remains.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can justifiably claim: she is to be found in people's pockets as much as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go and what moves them.
And that still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of Google.
Towards skeptics, plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he has him achieved: they would just overlook the essence of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus come closer to the company's original objective, according to which it wants to "order all information in this world."
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the collecting of information.
When asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google were able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that their Internet searches would register the search terms, as well as the IP addresses from which searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save their own search history and later to use it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the so-called "recommendations" are also based on the same logic, with which the system recommends tailored products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users are wondering what happens in the event of data misuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company, which is frightening, and less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power that comes across rejection among many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was the recent crackdown on paedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google presented information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophiles.
Users who are concerned about personal rights could breathe a sigh of relief in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully moved to trial against the FBI: thus, Google cannot be forced to hand over information to the FBI with any point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but they were deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search term listing for two months.)
Google's image therefore remains controversial: those who are responsible for releasing their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate spheres by using Google services, the company is scurrying with the indignation paid to the conservative enterprises.
However, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and enthuses computer fans, activists and users unified, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even if both struggle for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes to its users, and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks look through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet sharp - a relationship that has come to the focus, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing else than collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage their profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect them together via other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can keep blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries hosted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove that when watching the party photos of last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is being fired because he is only too honestly venting his anger at corporate guidance in his blog - one thing is certain: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Anyone who leads an online life is what he reveals - for example, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypasses the Google monopoly, can do so - such as Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately doesn't leave any traces.
Quite a few people deliberately do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, is captivated until Google shows her true face.
With their current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the ever-faster-established services are preparing headaches not only Microsoft but other software developers.
However, critical viewers also find the worrying counterpoles: for example, the Group Executive Board completely rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the repeated food for the employees is too costly. However, all of this seems downright mild against the fact that in 2006 Google even went to its knees before the Chinese government and agreed to an agreement that all dissident hits, or those who violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service is being advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could once again turn a lot of things: While some think Google's book and magazine scan respectively. Archiving project is now setting proportions that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, but others are more worried about the "health" system, which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is setting up a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the material - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian manner a future in which a person becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to Google-related data.
Two young people help the double murderer of Ã...zd to remove their mark
In connection with the double murder of Ã...zd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped to remove the traces, the spokesman for the Borsod Police Department said on Tuesday.
The youth were constantly charged with aiding and are currently being charged with aiding.
According to information from the news agency MTI, there are two girls who are defending themselves at large.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ã...zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of money.
In the course of the investigation, it was clear that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year.
However, the suspect did not want to pay off his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a site in Ã...zd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the crime from a long time - this is also proven by the fact that he has committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million Euro, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles had placed despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the securities in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As reported by the newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have now placed offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion. Crowns.
According to shareholder agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments dedicated to the ever-increasing international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European papers spoke of the "second 11. September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, said "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to unite one's own party for the bill behind him, which was to bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate, from a "second 11. September" to speak.
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now there is a risk that Washington has no political means of crisis management after the vote in Congress threatened.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism is taking place.
You can't ignore the threat, says the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
Although some states could provide bailouts to their financial institutions, their burgeture, and save the banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are going bankrupt, then neither other financial injections nor other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out of weakening financial institutions, recalls the Viennese "Der Standard". Furthermore, the newspaper continued, the concerns are becoming increasingly realistic that European taxpayers now also have to put European taxpayers something deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
The 'saviours' would not have to "wease" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to record in which case it would be reasonable to handle taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, inspiring the Nissan engineers from bumblebees to create new accident-avoiding systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can be seen in every direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the auto robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively.
"If it were not so, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a shift within which accidents are still considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of bees if they avoid other bees.
And that has to take a split second.
However, the evasion, unlike the bees, can not be done up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only towards the turnability of the tires.
While the bees are open to endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the rotational movement, or acceleration and deceleration, to avoid other bees.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to save it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and react to them accordingly.
It does not have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction based on previous maneuvers, so that it only uses a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabytes severe memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan believes will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering drivers around obstacles and leading it to their destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the 700 billion dollar bulk bailout law is now available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to purchase the banks' bad loans.
In the first pass half of money has to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time, Congressmen said after several days of debates about an agreement on the 700 billion dollar bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives of the United States, and said that the agreement only had to be put to paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister Henry Paulson said on the result: The programme will have an impact and it will become effective, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about breaking around the helm of the economy.
The written version of the parcel was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not hold a high flight on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives on the 2008 draft law on the stabilisation of the economy votes, then it is the turn of the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
However, the programme deviates from the Bush administration's original recommendation, according to which the 700 billion. Dollars should be spent at once for the purchase of bad securities that are against debited.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount will be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of bad securities, which is spent on the purchase of depreciated, bad securities, and over the other 100 billion euros. USD the President is to decide.
The programme is being reviewed by a separate commission, which also includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the interests of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As responsible persons of the ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources and the companies pay the expected damages appropriate.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to 700 billion. Dollar can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, said Paulson.
The leaders of the banks, which are now dependent on state aid, however, can expect that their shut-offs, which are scallopd in overseas slang, will be cut by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps in each case.
The reduction essentially means that if the ministry purchases in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the disused bank chief is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers' salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the limitations only refer to new agreements, so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state is gaining equity rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the bailed bank get better.
The draft law provides that the president will have to present a proposal to Congress over the next five years how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
There were, however, sceptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money, according to the Californian Republic Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were promoted by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, 12.9%.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008, and fell by 3.9% compared to the previous year's prices.
Due to the price changes in the domestic prices and the export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Sales prices in Germany have increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
The sales prices of the manufacturing industry have also risen only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was among leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for pockets and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, with prices falling by 2.5 percent for shoes.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials rose considerably in chemicals and production prices (1.6 percent).
A decrease in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical devices (0.9 percent) and slightly in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in paper production, as well as publishing houses and printing, remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic sales markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the 1st largest company. Price increase in gas introduced in July.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, the prices in crude oil processing have increased the most highly (36 percent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A decline in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical devices (0.3 percent).
The extent of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry last year climbed by 10.2 percent.
The prices of electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
The highest price increase was listed in the domestic sales market in the airline market in the airline market (0.7 percent) in the airline sector in August.
In the production sectors for consumer goods, prices were up by 0.3 percent, while they remained the same in the energy and finishing sectors compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector (16.8 percent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was noted, and a price reduction of 1.4 percent was noted for assets.
Industry's export prices measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a decline of 3.9 percent year-on-year.
The domestic currency was 1.7 percent weakened compared to the euro, and 7.1 percent compared to the euro, and compared to the exchange rate in August 2007, it was 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and by 15.9 percent in the amount of the dollar.
No more visas to the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the American-Hungarian visa agreement for the 12th century. The Foreign Minister will come into force in front of the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their opinion, "all now everything remains only due to whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced overseas in good time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present her the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she is also holding talks with Democratic Democrat Obama's foreign policy advisers and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, have supported the 700 billion on Sunday. Dollar severe bailout for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After days' marathon consultations on Sunday morning, Congress and representatives of the government announced that they had come to an agreement on the banking saving package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central questions of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the opponent suitable to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to grow his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice Presidential Union candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress had held the law on the 700 billion. Dollar heavy package will quickly accept.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and we have to act responsibly (...) - Your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he told 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC by ABC, McCain said: "We will all have hard to keep it at that (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said the plan also writes down the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of check-in for top managers - something to which he had existed.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives was probably already voting on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - this is how "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article "Bavaria's Revolution Destroys Their Fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The break of epochs is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already evident quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
As early as ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU lands at 47.7 percent, falling under the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, i.e. in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation systematically pursued by the CSU in the state has finally extinguished its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but were considerably etched at a time. But without any effects, the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain.
Modernisation is always accompanied by option propagation. And that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks the classic citizen groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma and a university degree.
Here, the support of the CSU dropped to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders cautiously entitled articles on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP is prohibited from interfering with the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit themselves to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely showed them in their cards.
SPÖ chef Werner Faymann confirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very much possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as vice-chancellor.
As he said, voters had voted out of Schüssel-Molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer, however, has reacted carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal causes of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition or in the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally by the ÖVP.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black, we are ready to assume governmental responsibility," says Haider.
Járka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which will be hosted by the EU Presidency of the Council, France, this year.
In her speech to the plenary, Mr Olivi Járka, Fidesz member of the European People's Party, drew attention in particular to the segregation of education, since it is one of the most serious violations of the rights that Roma children are taking place, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office reports by Fidesz MEPs, JárÃ3ka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the job hunt, the Roma would be pushed out of the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree."
Furthermore, JárÃ3ka stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investments in the early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU member states.
According to the honourable Members, it is important that these connections become aware of a circle as possible - that is, Roma and not Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma pupil starts school, the greater increase his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and VAT, they contribute to national spending.
"As a Union citizen, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated teaching must be stopped" - said LÃ3via JárÃ3ka.
As the honourable Member explained, a common, target- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the disegregation process in the education sector. To achieve this, correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully entitled citizens," said Járka.
Since last year's congress in Berlin, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the promotion of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in line with the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
Fox in the chicken coop
Due to a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance companies often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer in America.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are privacy programmes that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be independent, otherwise we entrust the fox the chickens to the fox - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees and the payment amounts in the event of damage as a result of the customer's health, and if the risk is too highly assessed, the insurance is not even taken out.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer's identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e. which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which illness the customer suffers from and what his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood levels are untreatable, which would automatically line him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to complete the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraine and hot flashes, but also against depression.
From the point of view of the insurers, the latter is a high risk factor, while those mentioned before are not.
For the query and processing of the data, their own societies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for their consent.
Meanwhile, they have to do so by law, even though omissions have not been punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and combine them with the data on drug consumption. They thus provide an even more precise picture of the patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard recognises that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to their data, otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election decoir, there are no heads rolling at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is only how long this mercy lasts.
On the last weekend of October, the fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided at the extraordinary party congress.
The much-coiled duo, however, already allowed to see that it does not want to stick on their chairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, which is at his career highlight - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7%. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was a "sole governor" in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
The potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, is also involved in the reconnaissance team, which leads exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free Voters".
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free Voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein duo first used, in order to then the aim-seeking politician mercilessly serving.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its powers on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman named the 28th September the "asking day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much of its success at the national level in 2005, is not reinstated with a joint effort, Merkel will not be able to become a chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU's terrain loss will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the Sunday elections, no opposition member made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies in prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
The legislature of the 10 million inhabitant state has been out without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name of "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "allow" some representatives of the opposition in parliament.
That is why the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically economically economically thanks to the rising prices in the import of natural gas from Russia. Loans were even taken up for alleviating the price increases, and the country has also agreed to the sale of the below-transgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country, to the Russians. In the background of the opposition's expectations, therefore, there was hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians banned travel in the EU because of the political system classified as anti-democratic.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, which lay the emphasis on the positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections, caused a temporary lullation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticised the campaign on Monday - after which opposition members are not allowed to occur in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition can see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners, for example, have been released, and Minsk is even prepared to create minor confrontations with Moscow by refusing to recognise the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with whom Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition to parliament."
The opposition is not planning any protests in the face of the results, but rather tries to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put obstacles in the way of distributing, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones," - said Milinkewitsch in reference that not even the most supported shift of the pensioners agree with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is merely a matter of time before the "social security" reminisc of the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, explained to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, not words". The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India are doubling trade
With the European Union and India being each other's leading trading partners on both sides, this was the main issue, among other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the Franco-Indish summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power, which should be given more votes and sayings about international concerns, the member states have not yet been able to agree whether they should support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and chief diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached, according to which trading doubled in the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion. Euro is to be increased.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods had risen from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India have also been legally brought together into one agreement, so that air traffic will also be stimulated in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The goal is to strike a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Underneath was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned. The convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides being responsible for failing.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, in other words, to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed, as did the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, which is why both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is now visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to be sent to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India are hoping for.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be held at the 60th anniversary of the 60th an Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights, will be present.
The Frankfurt Book Fair, the international book fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to attend the current event. You will distribute themselves over the 171,790 square metres of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square metre showroom "Punto Italia".
A press conference near the Room structure in the Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair will follow: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers throughout the entire, but especially in the adult and youth sector, is diminishing.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is held before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the inputs and outputs of the officials.
From today on, the measure will come into force against those cunning who first stamp and then drinking coffee during working hours.
The new "Anti-lazy law" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
">"Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta once again underlines.
The Palazzo Chigi ends with the establishment in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "the choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by everyone, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is no breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant .
In this regard, Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino works wonders at 7 a.m."
During a meeting of the Council of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
Of Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months the absences of civil servants have fallen to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work".
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italian public administration
"These wage dynamics - the minister's said - have been twice as large as the private sector over the last 8-10 years and far above the rate of inflation."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta decree within the Codacon-supported appeal.
"While the Minister for the Civil Service is making its mark with figures about lower absences at work - so the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active sleeping villain' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have joined forces to declare war on the illegal norms of the decree."
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is being fought for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; thus the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker's participant, during which inspection visits can be made and further aspects of the minister's innovations are being contested.
Napolitano: "Prevention against workplace accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents at work happen, three people die and 27 remain lifelong disabled.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal workplace accidents were about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as a result of murder.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will commit the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news these days confirm how decisive the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his statement to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "greeting the constant commitment to prevention in jobs, to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims and raise public opinion awareness."
"An indignant "Basta" has risen to this; understandable in cases of tragedies that, in terms of their size, are causing some fuss in the media and public sympathy. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events, which can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely a resource problem: it must be made decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives are of particular importance for a more direct awareness in school frames on the part of the young people who are nourished in the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not divert attention from its social seriousness. A legislative standard must be brought into force and improved.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, has stressed "the phenomenon of work-related deaths forms an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem."
"The data of workplace accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not preclude the fact that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's exactly what ultimately causes the tragedy."
"Like how believe that underlying there is not doing enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents. One can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – say Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting at school."
"Another effort is necessary - he adds - regarding communication and awareness raising public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in demand of a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke of "the continuing deterioration of protection for the occupational accident victims" and denounced the "abolishment of the social system we are fighting against in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employee a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided by a legislator at time at time."
Mp3 player on indictment: Harness of hearing loss
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, e.g. B. Mp3 player, hearing, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the EU Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks) in a report disseminated today in Brussels.
"From the report – a note says – it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years longer than an hour a day risk the permanent loss of their ears."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who place portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, their hearing without knowing it irretrievably damaging," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – it is said on the part of the Eu – shows a clear risk that pushes for action to quickly.
What really counts is to sensitize consumers and make this information common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are completely effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of the portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - thus concludes the EU communication - confirm that one is too much concern and that the Eu Commission, together with the other European members and those affected, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices ".
At the moment, there is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise.
One can very limit this damage by using solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of the noise suspension.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the Eu suggests that if the users of portable music devices only listen to the week (louder than 89 decibels) the years (louder than 89 decibels), so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply with regard to the maximum noise level at the job.
Those who cross music this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore be affected by 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We are starting today, in March it is said to be over, in June there will be a balance.
This is the process set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months' time, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the leading lines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," stresses Alemanno. "It will offer proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders will remain the city and municipal councils.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where a large project can be developed for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will disintegrate again, as such a project must have a timely end.
In June, the Lord Mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission".
Anyone who calls into question the competence of the Commission, because they are lacking in commitment, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it provides high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, against the other hand, want to have a longer period of time, all to work seriously with a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The Lord Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to explaining the following "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and will make us think. She will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus take a common step into the future."
A future, said the mayor of Rome, who "will not only limit themselves to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only in terms of Rome's role as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a declaration
A well-known American politician who is keen to be considered independent has written: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated through his decisions, the economy of the USA and who maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does this as a private individual today)."
Attacks against Obama are becoming more and more violent, especially now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
Actually, these attacks do not have much to say; these are racist attacks and they do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who the real American patriot will vote for.
This is where a mentality of the USA comes to light, which was kept hidden until the last.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for who we will make our creek, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the black candidate's success seems so secure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the asses.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains the weak point of Bush for the majority.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: the cuts can be felt in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain to those who responsible for the information were expressed concerned about the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the big problems caused by the cuts that the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put together the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the great audience understands it, does not shrink significantly.
Today, the American journalist fills the American journalist clearly but complicated.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors in the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the Executives even account for 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups make their way to the Internet, which is regarded by many as the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to want to join the new technology, hoping "they bring something good for journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters working for them.
56% of editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level there are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The plant managers, who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years, amount to 47% at national level.
It is among the journalists 30%.
The topic of "secure work" in the team (our "editors", note. ed.) is always a topical issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists are under contract.
In a vast nation, as the US are, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer as it popular them and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often receive very high wages, whereas the editor can sometimes receive only 10,000 euros per month, plus pensions and insurance funds.
As for holidays, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days of holidays after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often become "sick" during the year.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GRETTFERRATA
The President of the Second Trial Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to refuse the real estate agent's request. He had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for Bankrot in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the takeover of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a requirement for residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the public prosecutor's office had said) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain accused evidence to him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's 700 billion dollar savings package: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which reports on how the crisis divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favored state institutions and business community, and the neoconservative ones who are hostile to "theirs in Washington" and the financial world, especially in the south and the center of states.
This part of the party owes its rise, especially the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned is, however, only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even representing: not only in the USA, but also in the entire West and perhaps beyond these will be affected by them.
In both the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to have accelerated the long-feared events, which will finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of private household assets that live in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: how to behave towards the affected families, which are also an enormous crowd of voters.
The crisis therefore seems economically global, politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen aside in itself and have lost its right to speak: the illuminating proof of this has been given by the EU, which does not know how to find a common path due to its division into various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone is now counting on the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all. Distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became increasingly serious, only the USA has been saving itself in the economic situation without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have to use the legitimacy of them: thus two conditions not to be overestimated – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organization nor a market will be able to fall back on in a similar way.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the increasingly important thing that is recently associated with a sector in the economy in the most closely related sector: territoriality.
It is a paradoxical way, when we were so convinced that we have long since entered a networked whole, into a realm of the ever-differentiated technologies, the immaterial, that we suddenly have to realize how our future will increasingly depend on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although these can certainly all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are nevertheless connected to the finest piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the person who has such a territory is an advantage over another who lives in a stripless, waterless or area free of oil resources.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief insertion.
Who is the territory, who says government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge about the necessity of respected leaderships, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, even more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an impassion, an image of inexpedientness, a feeling of distance, all of which is directed at a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large sections of the population is making the way that it is not the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as becoming increasingly foreign and outcome.
The demand for leadership therefore nourishes underground a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This is manifested in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the sudden change of the collective state of mind of recent times: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some were saying their format, had more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value of what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is further strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In the face of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
Keeping the eyes wide open, however, is certainly not.
The super adhesive that lets it go up on walls
To be able to defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now seem to be almost the goal.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged into a stack of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs, which give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding ability of the reptile feet and at the same time "can be removed from the wall without any problems," says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
How to go up to walls like Spiderman? Perhaps it is already the researchers think of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall into the space sector.
For the moment the superheroes still have to wait.
THE METt OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that clean themselves from the dust like hair by moving on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicinal products: never taking with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed because of their refreshing quality and vitamin wealth, especially in the summer, can cause serious damage to health if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medications, since they can have an extreme effect on the intake of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaged and fresh fruit juices in conjunction with medication intake. Part of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia once again hit the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to the extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus at risk the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion of increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthma drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological remedies, to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTE IN SEFAHR – In a report two years ago, the same drug agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix, and stressed to pay attention to what is drunk in connection with means such as Diazepan or Metadon.
It is NOT GRAPEFRUIT ONLY – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the UniversitÃ Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, not to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasises the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Nobel Prize for Economic Beards goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of the 11th ceremony. September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received not a little polemic as an answer and was held up to the economist years later, but which is now proving to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandals disappeared from public view as part of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank's Executive Committee, Krugman is an "economment of great value," but also an aanaliser with a "very aggressive style, which is especially directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, there will be the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office, the open source software is gaining an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, among both freelancers and in public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new open office now presents itself to the audience with some new products: in addition to a revised and now more spartan initial menu, a complete compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is now achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.
It was also precluded by OpenOffice compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, e.g. sending via email is easier. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now be generated, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to include the elements of a table and a word processing system.
The collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by different users in hand, thus avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each processor is assigned a fryer to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently publishing various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet, while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, she follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if cost-freeness can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is especially in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the big litter: after all, various public administration and school institutions have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program aimed at displacement of Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of more familiar access; and last Draw, a graphics module.
The objective for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can also be easily exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Cabbage also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens with a frame of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth rider to test positive for Cera, the third generation Epo. This was already true at the Italians Riccardo RiccÃ3 and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those who have been carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotency, and according to the Associated Press, the Austrian authorities also notified.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber.
TOPIC AWANDER: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRASIS: IS ITALY ACE RACITRATION?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only welcomed with reluctance.
Do this make a nation of racists from the Belpaese? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and starts from the case of the young Abdul William Gu Gu, who was assassinated in Milan a month ago after he had stolen a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most of integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrantist sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega Nord is recorded."
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times invokes further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and for the more quick expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Guorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to cooperate between Church and State to fight racism during a meeting at the Quirinal meeting."
The small plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago, found
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, the one on the 3rd 9/11 2007 on a flight over the Nevada desert, was found.
The individual parts have been found on a plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely invalidated the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, whereupon a troop was sent out. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The American Road Safety Office (Ntsb) gave its attention that just a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a crew was sent out to identify the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was said to be held on the 3rd place. Founded on September 2007 after Fossett had launched a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found in California, not far from the border with Nevada, by a couple near their house at Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identification cards called Fossetts, both issued by illinois's Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a jacket.
The search for fosett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history by a long consequence of records.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he was the first person to orbit the World Ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he fought the world on a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among its several records also includes a high flight of 15445 m over the Andes, this one, however, with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisements you don't expect
A Suv, which falls from the conventional schemes due to its original design and the special lines, the spreading surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Precisely because of its extraordinary features, the presentation of Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17.
Thus the advertising drum that will accompany the emergence of the new model will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, located in various chamfers, which will occupy the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until the 15th anniversary of the city. November is to be carried out.
The first bevel will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D spectacles, which are distributed near Corso Como, a special look to give the whole thing: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seem to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments, in order to reunite as a whole.
Without a doubt, with this advertisement, the concern of Mercedes is to introduce a new type of autoretic into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be possible to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are just these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling after the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, did not cause any serious problems until recently.
There have never been collisions with enemy fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right milieu.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other small groups from Campania and Puglia joined these in Sofia.
They carry the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards had been provided to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal all: among those travelling to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or Tifosi identified during the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
Our hooligans will therefore no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there is fear of impotents who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be quit immediately, and that in no case give such behaviour the opportunity to justify it," it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on especially also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (sports supervision) will gather, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the right arm raised during the Mameli anthem? In Bulgaria this is not a criminal offense..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (significantly expressed in without joy), who has been the director of the arentatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was the chief police of Trieste, where a nucleus of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now come from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly these 150-200 people were behaving.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the land of their act.
Until now, this group had kept in check, but now it must be covered what has happened and will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the anthem of Mamelis: this too is not a criminal offense, but they allow me to do it, there is no education...".
Students Victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students knows no crises.
According to the last study by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. Entire hosts of students are thus effectively losing their right to study, since their families are unable to support them in this altitude," says the Sunia responsible, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental limit, unauthorised sub-leases.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which will lead to lower rental prices by revising taxation.
On closer examination of the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district approx. 450 euros are needed; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the neighbourhood of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, and a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the districts around the university, 250/280 euros are needed for a place to sleep, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the districts around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Rents in the other universities of Rome are only a little lower: 550 euros in Ostiense and CinecittÃ.
Only those who avoid the outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar districts.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for one room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, and a single room at least 350.
In the smallest towns, prices are lower, but they have greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rental to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above average is demanded by foreign students.
See you back to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the great urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of excluding cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death for the single hall cinema in the centre in the long term. A process that not only seems involuntary and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
Historical places full of memories are usually affected, "it is like losing a friend with whom you have covered a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who earned him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a cinema world that is probably lost forever.
The figures that the Anec, the central trade association provides, speaks a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this mine paid for the most part the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy lists, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but the first priority is the preservation of the existing one, because includes a hall in the city, not all of his regular customers are prepared to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the missing budget for the fund of the trade association remains outward: the debt burden recorded by the state is approx. 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To preserve the sector, between EUR 16 and 18 million per year would be required."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide on the fears of the old cinemas, to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
The forecast measures also include tax participations for cinema operators and advantages for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to go to the transport-limited areas of the centre and also to park for cheaper parking fees.
"It is a pleasing initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will follow suit and will also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to achieve something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had already played with thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by at the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side not to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The allegations of the anti-mafia authority of the Anti-Mafia Authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the community of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia shops, are severe.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Doing any kind of moral and legal norm disregarding every kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay attorney Piromalli funds for advisory activities."
"The mafia group had thus made it possible – thus the judges – to penetrate the council houses by official means and to help shape the policy of public administration."
The president of the regional committee Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that it is "all other than an exception in his region to encounter links from local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who preserve a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with whom the police decapitated the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but already in 1991 – and even because of alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – local politicians had already been removed from their parish offices in 1991.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the run-off election in May 2006.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He came along in Marco Minniti, Deputy Minister of the Interior, whom he accused of inventing everything for political-strategic reasons. In connection with the arrest warrant of this morning, the judges declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to apply for a change in the A3 project.
From a listening action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – which has made the measures of public administration identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones suddenly come to
It is a non-decreating source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet's surface, and only now do the big energy companies in the world seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is looking to look at and are also looking to be occupying, such as giants such as Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and investigated for 70 years; it is no coincidence that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of ocean energy was forfeited, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy demand could be covered by the energies generated by the ocean waves.
This would amount to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides would also be added.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to focus on ocean energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy sector relying on marine energy production.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – said the spokesperson for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs up the opportunity to work with us."
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign that is not to be underestimated, especially considering that oil continues to be produced by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which are investing in the new industry; the details are not known either, so observers speak of increasing interest.
Even more improvements.
Experts speak of a technology that is still on the rise, not least because the last doubts on the part of the environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland have been of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are required.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the float via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plant of this kind, which are only waiting for the state permit. Part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a merchandise store and a parking facility using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator due to the resulting rotary motion.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute of Electricity Extraction Research, the potential that lies in the tides deserves particular interest in the present.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of power.
It is precisely the tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
