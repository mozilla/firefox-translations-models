Police of Karratha arrest 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the rider drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through scrubland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the holding signals and continued on Burgess Road before turning into the bushland, where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the rider were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man not observing a holding signal and ruthless driving.
He is scheduled to be held on the 23rd September appear before the district court in Karratha.

Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for the 17th November to the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a citizenship.
"As unions die, middle-class jobs are dying," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and Vice-Council of Progressive Caucus.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Appropriation Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and stops thus anti-union forces.
The addition of the national labour law law to create a way for workers suspended discrimination to organise trade union representation, to sue for justice - and to obtain damages or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and comply with labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organise in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Douglas encouraged Mac and his staff to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and negotiate and act together are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize and speak out in the new nation, the Germans submitted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to found associations to secure and improve the labour and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "anyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect or join trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civilian and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and that this union must then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - be protected.
Having shelled these rights in America, it is indeed very wise to remind yourself of the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the nation's strength, but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America have raised in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped implementing a law in Louisiana on Sunday, which lawyers say was probably causing all five abortion clinics in the state to come to terms.
This measure, which was made by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and on 1st Sept. would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient recording right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while applying for such right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they seek to obtain these rights," wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing for the judge is scheduled to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion proponents welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that doctors would gain more time to obtain hospitalization rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana escape a sneaky law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Reproductive Rights Center, who had filed up the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the lawsuit and also requested for briefing rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that doctors' rights of instruction require unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion counter to the fact that the measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient-instruction rights, said the Reproductive Rights Center.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said that they would not penalise physicians for performing abortions, while their applications for patients were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video homage for her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia are at greater risk of dying from ovary cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australians who found ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
The research director Susan Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman also affected the chances of survival in the diagnosis, ovarian cancer type, existing pre-existing conditions and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to counteract the distances, she proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of flown-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women more closely at their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer, regardless of geographical status, and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned about the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres deploring falling homeowners
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds per year if today's young consumers reach the "Nuniversity of Garden Products" according to a study by the HTA study, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend with homes on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of paved front gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated 5 billion dollars are implemented annually in sales.
In Greater London, which has dropped from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them during a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden individual trade due to increasing homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers had been able to push the protesters out of PTV building again.
The transmitter ceased operation for around 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away, they fought with sticks and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but rejected it.
Meanwhile, the country's army calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and use without violence."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been putting up more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating on the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their followers to penetrate Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's longest-serving US diplomats to find out more about a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the charity of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report, which also had Germany's most important secret service, caused significantly more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Train drivers face consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The opening available for 6 pm to 9 pm concerning all transport companies throughout Germany, including long distance, regional and S-Bahn services,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said Sven Schmitte, the district chairman of the trade union German Lokomotivführer (GDL), in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional focuses.
The main shock direction of the warning strike was freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and employees of the city of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvia on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Following corruption charges against him, Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custodial detention by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf lie.
According to the Mallorca Diario online daily newspaper, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ to the office of the Anti-Corruption Office of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the cousin economy of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the business people told the court.
Let our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video, in which an 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who performed fellatio on 24 men during a steam tour.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the improper behaviour of alcoholized holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-soaked pub crawls.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub organizer Carnage have to pay a fine of €5,000 (73,000 dollars).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
First day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
The EARLY Kids has brought South Australia a winter surprise, with violent showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide airport.
In the evening until 9 pm another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen on the night of Sunday.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that began shortly before 8 pm and ensured almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had caused an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The gusting weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in the wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At that time, gusts reached about 50 km/h at the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off during a second landing approach and finally took up at around 8.40 pm.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time to large networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our home into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the receiver to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind it: if the cable were not, all listeners would fly around in the house without having to come astray, and that would be even more retro.
Anyway, on the Celtician (ekeltronic?
No, typo: electronic) Sector, the rule that the world's novelty of today is the electro-junk of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And anyone who still has a tube TV in the living room today, for example, simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because this week's pressure on the radio tower is once again demonstrating our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The library, which once mastered the washing machine and CD player blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with incredibly vain expert says: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" the press office promises us.
Yes, are it still possible?
What should one talk about with people who apparently volunteer to spread such quark?
Basically, it has been about some 20 years because we are supposed to network our house.
So that the yoghurt buys itself, so that the fire detector tells us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we arrive from the office the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, it requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We raise our watch, say it "suckling!" - and the vacuum robot starts at home.
mad.
Everything comes down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam cake sends the weather forecast and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this is of no use because we are in the s.
From daily practice we also know that if a pulodic device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air raid shelters, while rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a feeling of joy and expectation to the rocket bullet holes marked by rocket bullet holes in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, staff from the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrive.
"We are a bit scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weary" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted last week's war, thousands of residents of the border towns like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza, which is heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that their knowledge is gained and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the aerial and seaports in Gaza.
Israel calls for Hamas to be disarmed and the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during fighting at Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region, and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into preliminary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fights continue, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be opened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After your choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU federal vice said Thomas Strobl has voted in favour of an end to the current NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU size Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should be brought to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is performing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed in the five percent hurdle in the Sunday vote.
A first attempt for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the secret service had informants in the NPD top at that time.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now being housed in tents at the Newlanders Square.
The central first recording for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the interior authority has had three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
The district politicians were only informed shortly before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck campaigns are further fuelling the citizens' reservations and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, chairwoman of the Green Group at the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the Harburg district administration currently provides unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the initial admission are the onslaught of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in complications.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday's RP data.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
The head of research at RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tier market.
The figures of RP Data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne it was 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by five and six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government spending and where prices increased by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued saying that with the beginning of spring, the beginning of spring would now observe an increase in the properties for sale, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a general".
The style of the university is not, it says the statement.
The Medau family was already informed "ally in mid-June about the university's request.
The statement that the plans only became known in July are definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "prove presentations or even decisions", but that there are "preferences".
The removal of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access road, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is not mentioned of a nine-metre-wide road.
According to current status, it is about 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than before," explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument put by the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking areas will only be used by students of the university in the future.
Parking is not at all, because this can now be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking about local residents
The nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and would lead to the entrance gateway to the parking deck, is to be "not affected" according to the university president.
Rather, he points out "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the mouth of Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring secondary school.
It is therefore much more than about the particular interests of Mr Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the nursery, with the expansion of the road would be entitled to "the few natural place of Coburg be lost", "can the reader himself decide."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Authority, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university up to 2020 "and in this context address the importance of new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university.
According to this, the access road for the new parking deck is not to lead as before over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but over the Medau mountain.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be expanded in two lanes over a length of about one kilometre.
According to the Medaus projections, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day.
The city has not yet wanted to express its opinion on the project.
Glandorf resigns from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga club SG Flensburg-Handewitt mainly cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus goes into international retirement with a balance of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the shattering reversing room player wants to goal hunting for a few more years for the Champions League winner from Flensburg, he is now not available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, which announced its squad for the international games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
I was just as excited about my long-time players and my successors.
But for my club I would like to be available healthily in the next few years, but longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed even had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infections.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team physicians from the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later had caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass a single body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that I can control my head, but I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be ready in absolute emergency.
"When all else is tearing, I am always ready for talk," explained the twofold family man to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospitalization in 2012, I also became quite humiliated with my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Championship title and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in the spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone stimulated the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, the first half of the year represents a total of 0.8 percent of the GDP year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmanns town on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist's paradise near the Netherlands.
With their registration, more than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour through the Münsterland.
These tour interested parties were offered in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland better in this way," said the cyclists happily about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the clubhouse of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the rampart, where the start took place.
The route, which was announced for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometres with 1175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1475 metres in altitude and 145 kilometres with 1775 metres of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were boarded on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organiser Jos ter Huerne and mayor's standing figure Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organisation went without problems and there were no negative incidents," says Heinz Lölfing, drawing a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came as the organizer had hoped for, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and in the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on 30. August or during another weekend," the cyclists still promised to return to the Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's relentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography that has brought Konstantin Wecker, singer-maker, pacifist, politically confident activist, ex-prisoner, to paper in "monk and warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more scrap of thought for scraps of thought has been done by the smaller shell of th On June 1947, Munich born his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is resiliently honest: from onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not avoid human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned to tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also occupy abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - he tries to get to the bottom of all this, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how he not only shaped music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the bon vivant Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who "comes from subtraction," as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary."
Between all the highly spiritual views, however, there are also short anecdotes to earth: for example, about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a witty car ride, where he proposed a tree head-on.
He is relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was made from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work her way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to look cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Much of my life was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It is now a little lighter, but they are dark, smoked, deep stygic labyrinths with bursts of flame and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to simply lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he could wash the foundry away.
When I was running around, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love opinions.
My father never hugged me, he never said, "I love you".
Only when my mother was suffering badly towards the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop using the "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I suffered this fitness thing and also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very hard.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be seen in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Trials, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life.
He started at the age of only 16 when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV for quite a long time."
He learned at work.
I had to become tall not only before the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke narrative machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, an easy entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
That was very uncomfortable for my family.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grote knordie of black people."
With the introduction of characters who both mock and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought to himself: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like just putting time around or kicking a little on the spot."
After that came a series of documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was literally allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and mostly considered him a middle-class domain, white in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very scared.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt that I could do it.
It was almost like someone had finally put my head on me properly.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do it a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of trials.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You've now needed to bridge 10 minutes while they fix the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance went on as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, this strengthens the tendons.
That too arrived well, so it's like a big shield of the gods who tell me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THUR voice.
So I stay with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always search for it, you drive with it in front of a wall.
I sometimes read live in the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don't like it as much as I used to.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give up that again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi trailers had occupied central streets in Sana'a on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party said "Ansar Allah."
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened to further escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from the Sunni-ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding country there are repeated bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain "ghost employees"
Kenya has begun to register biometrically all officials to delete "ghost employees" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salary payments even after they were to leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the civil service when he took office.
During an audit at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million dollars (€700,000) per month were lost to payments for "ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public sector, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres over the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are included has been provided in a government message.
All those who did not do this without a credible excuse would be deleted from the payroll were further.
"This approach will make a significant contribution to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be held on 11. First tried in court for the first time.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
This was announced by a court spokesperson on Monday.
The complaint says that when Achenbach had cheated on works of art and old cars when purchasing works of art and old cars, Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher than actually paid purchases.
As a result, the agreed commission was higher.
Achenbach had purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of whom he was headmisular.
Manfred Richter knows many experienced Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his efforts to see man in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in Trautenau/Northern Bohemia in 1930, today Trutnov.
Already at the age of 14, he was interested in the teaching profession after four years of secondary school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight car.
So Richter switched to Senkendorf in Upper Franc.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the next station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometres across the whole city to the school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was accepted in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first state examination for the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching candidate.
Since Upper Franconia had no independent teachers for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came on 1. November 1954 to the school in Kollbach.
The "Misayin Room" was its first "service home" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room apartment in the newly built teachers' centre next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf school association was founded, only the primary school remained in the town.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had additionally a work room built on municipal costs and cellar rooms during the expansion in 1997, although this was not suitable for sampling according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered.
In his whole career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech by a government representative who responded to a presentation by a school council on law and justice: "One must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the age of 84.
And he had to know: "This does not always succeed." Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not quite clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat each other, they did not receive a prison work from him and were not given away for sitting.
At the expense of the community, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves purchased and let the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was to be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as rector.
After his retirement, he moved the non-party judge to run for candidates for the municipal council in 1996 at least the last one to be the CSU list.
But judges were selected to number six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, that is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of resting impression alone made: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour, including an accompanying bike, enjoyed a break in the lower spa garden of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists started the first stage, which attacked 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started by bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and soul: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 tin apple, plums, sprinkle and cheesecakes, which tasted the skilful cyclists wonderfully.
"Such cakes can only bake landwomen," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments were made at the beverage stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnastics club.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park looked relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "he deserved them, after all he has already attached bounced-off chains today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the well in front of the drinking cours house by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to promote Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotion chef Tobias Hagen, who has also been heading since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, could only take a brief career, as he had a lot of work with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle sweep of the police of Hesse by means of three telephones and a radio, communicated his pickup truck, using three telephones and made a radio, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have travelled to.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left again after an hour and a half: "Tschüss!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festival ambience and of course you had prepared treats, such as tarte flambée with a well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his function as a member of the board of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many company in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for lively moving outdoors was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens who were just as impressed by the good mood as the large host of cyclists were mixed.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the agenda for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," reporting local media agencies.
The police authorities did not make any direct comments.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking policemen, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested for allegedly establishing an organised criminal association and tapped phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the activities cited by the Islamist clergy Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1. September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere about Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian popular front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who attends Yatsenuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign for this and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC has perhaps found the great director she needs.
It arrives with a proud torment of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times' board of directors for seven years and resigned when the top post of parent company Pearsons went to a younger male counterpart.
Their severance paying was allegedly nearly 1 million dollars.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence acts in two directions: inward the first guard of one's own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This provides an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what newly arriving chair would risk being to embrace everything and taking apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps bringing himself around his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that were not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC in a smaller size - power, money and status obsolete.
As the competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public is buying itself in the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and later see missed programs on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it.
Perry from Texas says disparaging Tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's account who cancel the previous one.
Just a tweet has just been shipped from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," it was said in the later message.
Perry employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were made from Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County's district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk drunk drunk in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial support from her office when she refused to resign, which led to an indictment against Perry - who could possibly be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I am the most drunken democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the prosecution a political trick.
His high-class team of legal members applied to the judge entrusted to the case to reject the charges and argued that the law, which is being used against the most senior governor in the history of Texas, is misplaced.
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of state funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After concluding in fifth place at the election meetings in Iowa during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo from himself while jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market again "normal"
One of London's most prominent building contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned to normal level.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and the subject of enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England to set mortgage lending ceilings in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "The market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013" and added that this offers a "stable environment of action".
The property market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers were pushing into the capital.
According to information from the cadastral office, prices in the city area have increased dramatically by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices at Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by approximately one-fifth last year and were around 423,000 dollars in the late April.
However, a stronger pound has made property property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of which have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "villa tax" before the general elections next May.
London real estate agent Foxton warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which presented tougher lending schemes, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage permits in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its prediction for the rise in property prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, on the basis of an already weakening house price consciousness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year after year, says the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital city is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due forward sales amount to more than 2.2 billion dollars.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and the sales of the forward sales remained stable as a result."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent per year to 280 million. - The turnover is 18 percent at 1.6 billion dollars.
In a notice on Monday prior to the Company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that Berkeley's revenues this year are expected to meet current market expectations.
The analysts consistently estimate the annual pre-tax result to 450 million. .
Berkeley shares were fixed in London trading in the afternoon at 23.96.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence Performance at the 85th anniversary of the city. Oscars.
Nude photos by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images more 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and accused the hacker of "blatant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan, were allegedly procured by a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"Those of you who view photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" disputes, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of mine are FEANGE, people.
Let's defend the early days. *Wort game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a narrator of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They flowed, so it was best described, they slowly dissolved like a box that you left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant and perhaps a little mischievous.
And then shook his hand.
He knew him.
He was prickly, like hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for alleviating the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and maybe even brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older company, which Kevern considered her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a moist but paradisiacal valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
Nobody had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leak, in the bathrooms there were still spiders, slugs had left their mark on all windows and believed that all of them heard, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.
It was like the house from a children's tale, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat or more holding hands on the broken sun loungers in the high grass with Ailinn and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had joined the service console in a mentally absent way, which provided the country with calming music and soothing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their very aggressiveness, songs of this kind were not played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was really prohibited - simply not played.
It was successfully obsolescated, as the word is obsolete.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations had never achieved, and how people choose the vom tellerwäschen-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels in books, they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and singed up Ailinn's large feet in a coarsely comical serenade.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"That was a familiar song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game even then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, it was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly forbidden.
Improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be sure where they would end.
Likewise the mind.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years without being heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of his father's old CD.
But at least he did not have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed with the principle of group talent - grateful as the one spared from fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were, as if by nature, blessed with electronic talent and were looked after by the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning telephone phone.
What was left of the Polish community was taking care of the sewer system; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as WHAT WAS WAS BEEN WAR happened out of fear of being accused of fire shouting, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha whisper restaurants, held themselves considered and become depressed with the inaction.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her, ever could be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father love this?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought that he was somewhat strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see in the world than its uncombed raven black hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see otherwise.
"If you say it," mean it without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you are singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet do not directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your big knuckles are exactly the reason why you're preparing me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It had been strange.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the reassuring charm that was needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn of Solomons became red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console over and buried the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm frondels in the storm.
"And your bighead is exactly why I feel moved to you," she said ...
Except that I am not.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed itself in her eyes when she was rebelling against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the way here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and annoyed according to THE WHAT WAS WAS WAR when their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise her hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Thick head?
They would have shown her a big fist if she didn't take care!
They first kiss - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - first kiss them and then beat them.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the rusking itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt leaded, but the impact of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him as he moved away - just as her companion watched him from a room on the upper floor - a man complained about by something he had said himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well if she could not remember once she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Solomon's Ailinn looked at her feet.
Some years before the just narrated events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, worked on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative surveillance organ for public mood, at a short lecture on continued violence at low and medium levels in exactly the sections of the country, where their reduction, if not abolition, were most likely expected, in view of money and energy.
"Much has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human friendliness has historically been rarely felt, despite the highly questioning church towers between the s.
But some properties turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the passion he continues to arouse.
The population cries when listening to sentimental ballads, becomes intoxicated with stories about the difficulties overcome and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rudeness holds the rural communities as well as our urban fabrics firmly in their hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and stained quarrel at home, at work, on the s, on the s, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said their mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme walnut lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal to say.
Feminist?
Again silence.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free job.
We serve a non-bias company.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call "sidious" and "raw", could just as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If you continue riding around, WHAT IS SEE, IF IS SEE, it happened yesterday, it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential vitality to the country.
Esme walnut looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, value their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, talk, tell you, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing other than that we are not as effectively cured as we are making ourselves.
My concern lies in the fact that we may find ourselves without warning how we repeat the mistakes that were only even committed to THE WHAT IS SEEING.
But this time it is not the others about whom we omit our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call action "errors" that our grandparents perhaps or not committed.
They also go too far when you speak that they would have left their "worry" and their "mislead" to "others".
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as we are protecting the present, we do not speak of "us" and "others."
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"From who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured into "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not answer anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what has happened, has happened.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said about this anymore - we agree on that.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, no debt must be redeemed if such a repayment were appropriate and if there would be a way to redeem it.
But to what serves the past, if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to forget it.
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz caused his pyramid to coincide.
"I'll consider their report," he said, released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup d'état is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officials in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said that they were attacking against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded his residence and had occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after he had reported on attack threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup, but that the military is responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose arming was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defence forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party young fanatics who were about to do havoc to cause wreak havoc," he told Voice of America.
The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had earned the impression of an overthrow.
"Although no one has claimed to have usurped the government through violence, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Lesotho military spokesmen announced on Sunday that the soldiers were moving back to their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing is taking over the leadership of Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believes he was targeted because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit purchasing manager's index of manufacturing (PMI) fell in August to 50.7, following a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories slumped at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to deal with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone, as well as for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information later this week as to whether it is considering quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, the PMI fell to 46.9 in the second-largest economic nation of the block, France.
France remains a problem child, as do Italy's descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer effective in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands, are also not reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is probably fuelling the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economics Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the November manufacturing purchasing managers index in the eurozone is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the conditions that remain in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB must eventually launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The decades of hell of Beslan's survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, how the children who are suffering in it.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1st September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, capturing and killing seemed like the wickedness of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now haunts Ukraine - and in the children how they die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed when trying to climb back into the school sports hall shot down
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried to climb back into the school sports hall shot who was shot in the school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
One soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I fear that I need to be operated on again.
Some shrapnel are still in my knee.
Their goal is to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me down," she says funny.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think about a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes somewhat weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the age of seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After a blast, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Running."
Frightened, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, seized it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who shuts his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in turn assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the newspaper News of the World), which was now dissolved, to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-time Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes pale in my memory.
I remember that I threw away all my toy guns right afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these children I played in the courtyard and who didn't make it outside.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say that they have stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a car open up.
But now he has fear for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I am so sorry about all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope that they will take me at the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 Children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and simply tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting me and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.
I still remember Damir wanted to eat borsch and called them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at her with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and supporting us.
She said, "I always think this world has not gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are the very children like ours.
I think that for many the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
He, for example, does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know that he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember sometimes laying down on the sofa, turning his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw hell around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could have possibly survived.
"I remember shouting at him, "Damir, running away," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so, unlike many others, life continues for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible picture became the symbol of the atrocities of Beslan after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloodshot-brooded by fear when he ran for life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had stopped him for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the courtyard for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy there stayed alone for three terrible days," she remembers.
Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgi managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's a long time ago, I mean it happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always haunting me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgy wanted to go to school on this day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of weeping Georgi in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home on the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People repeatedly investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years are nothing at all with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege for about three or four years, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall, if the 1. September approached.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not pity.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and visit a medical school in Wladikawkaz.
I will become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it as if it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is not something I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year later - the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Surviver: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I am physically fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I have submitted my documents, including the medical, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children my experiences.
Children should not know about this and they should not suffer it, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgy will not go.
It must be much more violent for him because he was there and I was not.
I waited at home for him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God for being returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays within us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is difficult to accept this if something so unfavoured happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he cannot participate because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can walk, but does not play any sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be pursuing us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege and only reinforce my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for those killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also by widows who have never remarried.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want to.
I will never forget my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost cannot believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and that many are still killed.
If only we could grab and throw all these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskaieva, 10
The baby, which was so movingly worn by a special task commandoon to safety
Saved: Aloina Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operation Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried out of the siege of Beslan in the arms of a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let them go, but held their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall in their cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, which he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, ten years old today, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that rise with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of having run over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is standing in court because of the ride of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the way to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The prosecution states that Mr. Steward steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and violated the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the January case.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about 300 dollars.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all available at a price of less than 350 dollars.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the didom dangerous underwater conditions.
And before jumping in, check to what depth your equipment is functioning.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our purchasing guide and reviews for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not work out.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams normally.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at this underwater, and the right image shot is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will become dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when taking pictures in a pool, lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions underwater.
It is especially important when working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they are to fill the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the strain whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthetist, he dedicated his career to the task of spare the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembered, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were important to doctors, while those treated are predominantly concerned with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty getting up.
While fighting with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently reproached for his wife Juliet.
"I prefer everything to do right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually worried and for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the fur of the breast, i.e. the skin overlifting the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients were former smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre construction material, which was once considered a "Wunderstoff" but has since been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be easily ignored.
After all, asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where he was still in use, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the peak of a mesoltheliomic epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma death cases since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason we are now experiencing the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos were banned) is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools where we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
The parliament buildings are asbestosed.
Even in the hospitals where we are to become healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been identified as the initial herds.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber.
Indeed, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us will still fall ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he was on the 17th He died in February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothoon denominated people die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still become ill?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when asbestep miles in the UK are expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them at the moment have no idea that they will die like this.

A quick look at the files of the courts, which the affected persons often turn to for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesotheliism is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had suspended negligently asbestos.
She worked for the necklace for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most found today's asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nevertheless viewed by the EU and WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, the brown asbestos (amnit) and the blue asbestos (crokyditeoline) is more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "they provide clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomarates."
A employee of Marks & Spencer was suspended at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study by those affected, which presents that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure was caused by work or in-house probably by asbestos contact in the environment."
According to his statement, a large part of these contacts is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the hearts of the government could have been unknowingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite would happen.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion dollars must be spent on several years of work to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, the MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green bodies.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is waiting.
A person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos laying down were decided positively," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have been working on and the data.
Exactly what he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he had such a fever.
He was 45, and performed an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly I had a chill.
It all suddenly came.
I felt awful.
I felt the trip to home no longer being able to do it.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was caused by the chest coat, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took x-rays from his chest and attach pleuritoath ethers to remove fluid from the lungs and test them in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without a diagnosis.
His health improved slowly and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and violent breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not bind this to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his family doctor took his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced to the cave between the rib fur and the chest fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "It was told mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesagoonism meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestosulation in hospitals were lying below the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the doctors treating.
It is still removed today.
Students deployed their Bunsen burners to asbestos mats.
And it does not just affect hospitals.
Asbestos was widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemical lessons, students have parked their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes such as floor slabs or scale roofs have included asbestos as standard.
"It is an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that affected woman came up was to demolish a garden shed in the 1970s.
So take care of how you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't experience another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor "how long have I got?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't experience another Christmas.
That's it.""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breath itself - is that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibres.
When asbestos is whirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the fur coat, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the fur of the pectoral and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It is precisely the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects that it has subjected him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also presumably exposed to asbestos during her hospital training.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed to the edge where the skin is from the breathing process.
It is naturally invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly disputed.
Some think it is worth a try.
Treasure denies it.
"You can't cut out the skin of the breast," he says.
They cannot avoid the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not speak very well for chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for co-data subjects four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer headquarters," he happily imagined when calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a more positive light."
After the consultation of several doctors, Abbott decided to treat his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thrac's thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage as I didn't have to be referred further, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments inevitably fail, many of those affected are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognised that even a very low burden was a health risk.
And this is where the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually said their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation," since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a speaker of the guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who are trying to compensate for a huge problem of a company's deadly asbestos contact - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been clear new legislation this year, making it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation, even if their former employers can no longer be found.
The law has set up an insurance industry fund fund of 350 million dollars for anyone diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have assigned to them in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 dollars.
Around 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many mesotheliome sufferers, that 350 million dollars were a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, indicating that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone over, and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Secretary of Labor and Pension, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven fatalities, quick action was necessary every day.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After her initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which, unlike Tom Treasure, he expected a positive effect.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent for five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's the most important thing, of course," says Abbott.
You can see this again and again in patients.
There is something that lets you continue.
If you give up, you're very worse off.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is life-sending.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there is no trace of the tumours visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You need to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look ahead.
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was given my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had an illness that I would not become old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impeed.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelio natives such conversations are not pervaded by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease provides grim security (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould).
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the Hong Kong electorate's nomination of candidates for the 2017 election.
This approach is likely to fuel the long-proclaimed protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within a few hours of the statement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the communist leaders to reject all candidates who are not loyal to the peking.
"It doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were lied to the population.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have its residents elected the chairmanship of the government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership will keep the process of a tightly controlled nomination committee in its hands.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the land and love of Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most audience-focused protests were held in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that is to take place only if all the chances of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, there were tightened security measures including police forces and barricades in front of the government building.
The riots are enhanced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland is increasing the competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement because they endanger the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said law expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to frighten fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The Chinese state-controlled media also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as Western powers-controlled subversive agents.
This summer, activists organised an unified referendum on the electoral rights, in which 780,000 people took part - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school leaving balls in the USA will now be transferred to the universities, where freshmen performances are offered by private plane.
We are happy to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service for today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury this year.
A company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings yet, as the service has only just been introduced, but added that "students will book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of 9,000 dollars per year, it expects a market for this offering.
Students today differ greatly from the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in their expectations and demands - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as a stand-up.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NIS for higher education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month are facing a crisis of living expenses, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply increasing bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds as simple as arriving in the student residence.
Feminists criticize breed issue and police behavior according to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, not shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing the right of reproduction and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention across the country, Perez saw that white women's responses were 100% revolved around the race.
Compared with the answers of black women shortly after the shots of 9. August came the personal essays with titles such as "Thoughts to Ferguson of a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this was an important change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism who are about white and talk about privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems faced to which black American women every day, but who are not considered as "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how coloured people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of dissipating the themes clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the topics of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Studies at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's suffrage like Susan B came. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th year of the 19th The century analysed and noted that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catching" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child's right to raise as seriously as they do with the right to reception control?"
Second-generation feminists who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race, which are clearly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although stone stands for a more intersectional feminism in which race and gender issues are addressed, some of their comments on the race theme are stunned in America.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson are contrary to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is coming to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police has picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also returning to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the issue as an essential women's theme, she merely needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate in the women's organizations," she said.
"Pork House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 dollars.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that had bedked his head on a sofa.
Real estate agents Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo was mistakenly published and has since been removed," said a spokeswoman for the company.
In the Exposé of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique detached house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sales caused interest on social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is this month's turn
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner who will receive nearly 1.1 million dollars from the ticket draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to register.
The shop owner Steve Forward said the profit caused material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and all are quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
This past week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a married couple from Belmont had achieved the mega-winning of 7.5 million dollars just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said that the winnings allow them to travel around the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is 59. Winners of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas asked to the gladiator arena
It was not only the gladiators standing ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely inspired by the historical spectacle.
There was a colourful round of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troop of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and successively sent his men into the ring for heroic duels in various gladiator species.
First, the "provocators" were on the turn with rectangle sign and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm splint on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and wrench as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", which competed against the "Secutor" with a litter net, trident and dagger and, after a short struggle, pushed the boys to the ground.
The swords crashed metal, the shields were rattling and the thrat successfully flew through the arena that could become fear and anxiety for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the musculous referee, had always an eye attentive to them.
"We wanted to revive the culture of Roman life and make the culture of Roman times tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as vice-mayor Claus Wehage stated in his welcoming address.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of these were also marveled at the Römertag, such as "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1400-metre-long Roman canal bridge, which was once standing at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now contrasted the supply of water and energy, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This is also confirmed by the diploma surveyor Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocud steeple, the hot air heating system that once warmed the Roman villa.
Also impressive the footprints, which had been left in tone by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for the Preservation of Monuments at the Rhineland State Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Industrial Park North in Rheinbach.
They found enclosing walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and malt.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained by archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass containers and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser assumes.
She also occupied themselves with the Roman windmill play, similar to today's mill play, or they once wrote their names with metal handles on wax boards.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, tinker with glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim nature centre to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
With the faithfully reproduced Roman tour carriage, which was brought to the original cold-blooded collection, visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21. The municipality of Wachtberg will also be brought to the Roman year 2014 proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is intended to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the partnership association and the amateur playing district of Oberbachem, among other things, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and the Roman past of Wachtberg are reminiscent of the Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell of his work on the rampage of Wachtberg, plants will be presented as living monuments from Roman times and offered a funny lesson in terms of international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germanicians" and the Romans who were presented.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman topic as part of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, often but not at first glance visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made possible again.
In the Wachtberg Town Hall, a small presentation will be remembered by the find of the Berkum Matron shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic weighs on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are distancing himself.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a severe blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are also already distancing down.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to buy food against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, where more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities said that the disease had penetrated to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, and thousands more were infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are suspending their operations throughout the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: only a few merchants still leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotting in the fields, among other things.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Foods are coming scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Parisian expert on the West African economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and pressingly: food is becoming scarce.
On the markets, the supply of staple foodstuffs like rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with damage to image - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and for how long the virus will spread.
Investors can give the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also burdens the strained state budgets of states
The disease also puts a strain on the already strained state budgets of the states concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely strained by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also clearly decreasing.

The Nazi regime had initiated the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men find themselves looking after, who on the 30th April in the Gasthaus Lukas have found the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau.
Karl März and Adolf Ried guided the club as master shooters through a difficult early year, in which it was primarily a matter of finding a club restaurant and installing the shooting business.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the shooting club started in the guest house "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st classes. Gauliga.
The club records are purting every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club has no longer met the demands of a modern shooting club, the then board member under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours granted on 8. May 1988 Father Strasser for the new shooting rooms the church blessing.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th. Gaussians, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On the 23rd and 24th The shooting club celebrated its 30th anniversary in April 1994.
A group of fireflies was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a specialist in the area of Mr.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the association as a whole was the hosting of the Bavarian Beacon Meeting 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work last year, the members of the association modernised the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof, thus bringing them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, an air pistol team, a sports pistol KK1, a youth team and two AH teams.

Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended roughly halfway by his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time, after his right front tyre burst on lap 172 and finished his evening.

Dance enthusiasts of young talents wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to colleagues.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn are also helping to create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now you are increasingly being sought after a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15 year olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "one could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you are in the mood for dancing, you can feel the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without a obligation, into the training lesson between 5 and 6 pm or on Fridays between 5 and 6.30 pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.

Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are continuing to rise.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tank battalions were allegedly involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn staffing consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without calling details.
Pro-Russian separatists fired aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters, according to their own account.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, according to the insurgents on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships had come under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, said a spokesman in Kiev on 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several towns in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In the run-up, all stakeholders used their appearances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO is sticking to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a blatant breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, "they regard us as opponents" were found.
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it wants to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "readiness action plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary," said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official figures, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to relact their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union is still being waited to see whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also disrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe receives around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: toll will come "quite clearly"
Now the Chancellor is once again professing this.
But it is not a carte blanche for all complicated details.
The CSU has become increasingly angry with persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car toll.
After continuing resistance from her CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a passenger car toll.
"To make it quite clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU leadership committees in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not agree on a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "suggested, and this is now being carried on".
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel also stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also constructively engage in the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about that." Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncomments on Sunday, his house was testing its own concept to reimburse motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU boss Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU summit Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal roads should be applied," said the CDU chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that it would be discussed once again about the topic.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU regional associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is that a toll will affect small border traffic with neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty to the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU.
The left considers the plans to have failed in the light of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the minister fails". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, according to the coalition agreement, domestic car owners may not be subjected to an additional burden.
Therefore, they are to receive full compensation for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she was going to die for many years as a result of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another illness.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Sufferers also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms will get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - an illness with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she would 18, and before her 30. Birthday die.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I constantly fell and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride roller skate or skateboarding with the other children and was often teased at school because of my way of going and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretched her feet, she saw her medical record when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looking for the illness in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received my answer, I was shocked and was terribly panicked.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at the age of 25, and slowly lose all my abilities in between.
I made it all down with me alone and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not lost as much as she had imagined and interviewed her doctor.
He just stood up, hugging me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you would be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was found.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks display since the closing of the former military training area
For almost ten years now, the former military training area in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
A deafening bang resounds in the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training area, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden of business people in the Washington area rises with the economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax assessments for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the area district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid €27.6 billion in government and local posts in the 2013 financial year, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenue of 26.6 billion dollars.
The state and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to 671 billion dollars, compared to 3.9 percent year earlier, and it was the third year of growth in a row after the several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the Service Agency Ernst & Young, with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenues, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while Maryland's revenues come from companies.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes of 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be true for the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over 10 billion dollars in government and local real estate taxes last year, compared to 9.6 billion dollars in 2012 - an increase of 4.2% over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as the real estate tax rates amount to just over a fifth of the tax notices of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following is happening: a large portion of the real estate, especially in the tax territory around D.C., is owned by either the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
For example, Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Company revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state organizations of 2.3 billion dollars compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland included 1 billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The district rise rate equals the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
With 6 percent in all three areas of office, Virginia has the lowest company income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District is a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia is required to include lower state and local business taxes and the overall tax climate is better than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better at the small businesses in the Washington area, and therefore they are paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure according to which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia, increased last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion dollars, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general over-the-counter tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the area could lag behind Washington if the Federal Government's cuts in expenditure affect the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said the Vice Party secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during a visit to an SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolis during the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, promoted Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD leader Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who lined the German delegation of politicians, agreed with the host that he would listen to the project in Germany after a possible partner.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre is already radiating Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou then attacked the shepherd gorge with shepherd gorge - but with red wine served with the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business transactions
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice Party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but had been cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," said the local politician.
"The business between our two cities is continuing to grow."
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li filed a lawsuit.
The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital Guangzhou is the capital, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground during his talks with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, noddded in agreement.
Well-gathered partnership
The affable deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not in this function.
He was only held this year, after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being enforced by head of state Xi Jinping with severity.
The new leader Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his political career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town twinning.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometres away, is one of those maintained by both sides, such as a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South China metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it wants to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "shuts down your thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her being admitted to a hospital in New York City three days ago; however, her daughter now showed herself hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a communication.
We are all keeping our fingers crossed.
According to sources, her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
Stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are on the market as of today from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from 1. September to a label where the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, "Euro 6" contains sharper nitrogen oxide values in the emission class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding manufacturers: They receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros throughout Germany.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: Online retailers - and video producer, and a host of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars (USD 970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if selling Twitch to Google's video service was adopted thing for a cool billion thing, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, Twitch was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their flying color pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which the (mostly older) games give the (mostly older) games a look of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is the case that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal did not come about with YouTube, since the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watching, it is difficult to understand the attraction that expects to watch others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. while sneaking through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a spinner hit in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
All these games could be viewed right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control of the viewing perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are fun.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuoso, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do sceptics know how to do I do?
Twitch is viewed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic spikes.
And how does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch "faith both to the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not even - swallow - as a spectator sport.
On Saturday, there was a lot going on on the bouncy castle at Burggartenfest.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the strong downpour on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt flying light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
The open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is to radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident in early Saturday, when the first visitors set out to become open air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedeler, but also guests from the near and other surroundings, had made themselves comfortable around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, showed their feet in time, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were the day.
And that across the generations.
While one of them smiled at the beach bar on the extra-carious white sand, others were faking on a quarter of wine in the vineyard, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when it comes to make-up, the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to become a master of the crowd and conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The stronger ones used the football tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which was hosted by the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he pounded down on the visitors, especially families sought space and dry space.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not detract this.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all along the line."
Therefore, there is no way to a repeat of the big party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked on, Sem made clear to the Volksstimme in a first result on Sunday.
He described as angry that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little effort.
The consequence: Some who had already paid did not get to the grounds.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organiser spoke of about 1200 visitors who were bustling around the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band BlocksÃ3n-Rox broke off their performance therefore unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned hookah lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a ripening flat.
"They will be there next year," says the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula Open-Air was more than successful in the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but must be removed at the second edition.
The organisers also have to take criticism in the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but you simply expected more for twelve euros," says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately you took over a little," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others don't see the initial problems quite as tight.
I think it's very good that some are not only stupid chatting, but also really trying to put something together.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organizers have one year to remedy these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark is shrinking
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-ready component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called Radom, is being completely renewed.
With a diameter of 47.5 metres, the new radome will be slightly smaller than the old one.
However, the size still remains a world record.
The last step towards completing the new shell is to replace the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is put on.
If the weather plays along, the action should take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge is dislocated
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was taken to the hospital after she shouted so much about the Ice Bucket Challenge that she had lost her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shed so much when her ice-cold water was cast over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was the act, my jaw simply stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the age of 20.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was stuck, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw it too and almost shine in his pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20 year old from the UK was hospitalised to get the jaw lowered after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times it is linked to Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs pulling them back together soon?
Recently there were repeated disputes between the two Wolfratshaus castle associations.
Now the board members are thinking about possible cooperation.
The late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France, as a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the castle association and the castle lovers Wolfratshausen.
The viewpoints of the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction seemed to be dealt with by speakly differently.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: discussions will soon be held on a joint approach.
The club board members Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this on demand from our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together," says Sjöberg.
In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
In this way, visible successes are achieved more quickly.
While the castle lovers had in mind around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until then a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the castle club around Sjöberg represents the "Ernetisation and making way forward" of the site at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle lovers, was very happy about the call, according to his own information.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been heading to the castle lovers.
A new chairman is to be found in a members' meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how things could continue."
According to Piffl, the new chairman is to go into conversation with the castle association.
Until then, the lords of the castle could also make themselves a current mood within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find each other." He does not want to run for a candidate because he is resident in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman was to be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to "continue working on the project."
The different positions in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He pays tribute to Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects, already advanced in Austria and France, would show that this idea is not a castle in the air.
Due to the high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project." An "Entertainment Point" for the rafting town could be created.
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financially affordable through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard personally." He hopes that the castle association may vary somewhat on this point.
Their goal of documenting the story first "is important and good".
After that you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students amounts to more than 1,000 dollars per year, fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought about a clever sparidee.
He invented a loan system for books from higher semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the return.
"My math book usually costs 180 dollars, but I got it for 10 pounds for a semester and a chick-fil-a-kek," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last semester would have cost him 430 dollars, he said.
He spent 120 dollars.
The college administration said that on average students spend more than 1,200 dollars annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there were various cost-up options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly solving the choice for students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly lower price than when purchasing.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university book stores, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus book stores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-time one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost 290 dollars, but can be obtained from the specialized text book retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 dollars.
Used for sale
If you don't mind the notes of other or normal usage traces, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for 93,49 USD.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for 48 dollars.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors whether previous editions were permitted.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rentals
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you do not want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of one semester for about 20 pounds.
Find out about the provisions of the business you rent, including the penalty fees that may be incurred for writing notes, underlines or signs of use.
Tenant pay attention: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of conventional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 pounds.
Bracey says that students often find the best deals in literature courses, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for book determination, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, says Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four week delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" did not become a box office hit
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars in his 90 million dollars in the US, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" earned only 12 million dollars in his budget of 70 million dollars.
The movie "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz recorded only 14.6 million dollars on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Drachenzähmen made easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
When filming for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly rearranged the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie release, between American Memorial Day and 20. July 2013 and the current year on at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of the past year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming jungle book movie, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to run after the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash register results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues from streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which revenues amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and prophesying a "melting melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential health counter-exhibition hits to be expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the cash outcomes as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporters, "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2. Table tennis district class has been cancelled for the cement of leagues, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis team has an additional 3rd edition. Bundesliga is included in the programme.
The consequence: those who did not ascend have stayed.
For example, Göttingen's class-highest team Torpedo in the Oberliga delegation has avoided the relegation, but only plays five class in the coming season.
Ladies' class in fourth class remain, despite their magnificent march into the regional league.
The boys and girls from Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are competing in the new Verbandsliga, with Göttingen clubs no longer representing in the Landesliga.
In the women's race, TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new District Superior League South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholten, Weser FC and TTC compete here.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district superior league of the ladies begins at least in terms of target strength.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are held in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league relay of the SCW-Jungen - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two district leagues were competing with nine teams each.
In the western relay are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the Eastern relay.
The women's circle league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at a circle level.
It is striking that none of the six second curve classes achieves target strength, here the innovative and bustling district council will have to think about.
Nato Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us at the weekend and talked to demonstrators who traveled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO juvenile bushwanders were brought to safety with the winch after being trapped in the Blue Mountains in NSW during the night.
The 16-year-old girl and 19-year-old man set off for her tour in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday after Sunday after Sunday.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search squad of local police and emergency services broke out and the couple was found at about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had hit his head.
Rescue workers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were admitted to the Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station has resumed the broadcast after half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial office.
The dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse electoral fraud.
The police announced that about one kilometre away from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, about 3,000 demonstrators, had come back to clashes with security forces on Monday.
According to the hospital, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured during the weekend, when demonstrators tried to reach Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, the powerful military had called on a political solution to the conflict to "warn without time and use without violence" after a meeting at Army Headquarters.
Further, the statement said: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The escalating violence has stirred up concern over the intervention of the military, which has already been caused more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on the 14th edition of the day. August to.
Sharif declines resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to persevere on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed itself similar.
Khan accuses Sharif of having won the parliamentary election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is to reform the electoral system and declare new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially stayed peacefully in front of the parliament, until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer to finish in third place in the standings after second season victory.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to an end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the end in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sense of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who finished in three place with green-white.
With the second victory of the season, Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes to the international pitch with a happy success.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leading volleyball from the sixteen recess in the 14th century. Minute has set the course for victory.
"I thought I hit the whole frustration of Thursday and cold it under the bar," said the 26-year-old with a smile.
As Schrammel on the 13th Novmember 2010 had met in a Bundesliga game in 2010 was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid upshot," Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pool blessing by Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his job there very well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror-inverted manner.
He deserves the gate, he has already done some assistants this year," praised Barisic.
The team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after just over an hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written down.
"Thank God we were a bit lucky today," Schrammel also noted, who alludes to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not vote, but the playfulness was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even said that "one was better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season".
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him, no less pleasing: "That we finally played too zero again".
The fact that there are also several attacks with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger also gave their starting debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," warned Barisic, who lost players in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, "who have been very stable recently."
The break of the international match must therefore be used to "leak wounds and gain a little in the physical sphere," explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in its ranks.
One who comes along most likely the break is Captain Hofmann.
He tears apart for the team, goes over pain.
It was in this difficult phase that he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic stated.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th. Minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who will be 350. Bundesliga game completed, it was the first hit out of the game since 2. November 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "You don't think that everything is good now" "We certainly had a little lucky, but at some point luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He asks, of course, to concentrated further work: "One must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as badly in recent weeks as it has been shown.
However, we must not believe that everything is fine now.
He could not deny the significance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to accuse himself and his team.
He regretted the quick return goal "from the Magi gate category", as well as the regular goal of use in the 40th category. Minute, which had been wrongly stripped of him by referees counterparts.
The only accusation I can make of the team is that we were not concrete enough in the direction of goal in some phases.
We have had too few degrees.
Centre-back Maximilian Karner looked similarly: "It started equally badly, but then we found it pure and even made a gate.
On the whole, more would have been possible.
Under this treet reigns quiet
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My Piece from Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißrestiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600 year old oak.
It passes coupling, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone seas.
A piece below the quarry of the Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees in the area and reminds of an American sequoia with a circumference of more than eight metres.
A small Buddha on a stump of tree suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only reference to the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what about the hussing pond.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Accordingly, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders are said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the meadows, which are laboriously cleared of stones.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal guardians from the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows there are actually herds of goats.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has found out further.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, one should exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place to stay for cruciate otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, which climb towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the water castle?
However, a water castle that is looking for at our next task is rarely found in height.
The reflection in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district, which could be used by the building centre.
Where is our "Blessing from the Rhöner Glück"?

After weeks of tight-long tug-of-war, Italy's prime minister and acting EU leader, Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week, has prepared his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she becomes successor to British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi looks at how the pro-government daily La Repubblica reflects the appointment of his Mogherini, who also appoints in the government team as a favourite, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to ensure that the left party base, which is repeatedly ridden against him, since Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit rather in a moderate way.
Towards the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish of the Council, who were nominated as the Council, will become Donald Tusk, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, thus establishing a political balance.
The EU chief diplomat will also become a deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The outstanding consent of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has been ready for almost two decades in leading party offices and known for its ambition, will be up to the "enormous challenges".
Born in the Roman, he is married and has two daughters.
The political academic, who had had a doctorate in 1996, began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic Centre Party of Margherita to form the current social-democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became vice-president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Left Democrat Party Council, she joined high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO's mission in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his Minister of Foreign Affairs.
If the PD now has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has played a part in it, as is noted in PD circles.
The retention in Brussels, the new EU High Representative has too little diplomatic experience, is therefore lacking in substance, is skilled in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poles and the Baltic members, there are suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini follow to the crisis in Ukraine and defame it as a "Russian course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy.
After Renzi began his term as EU chairman in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos showing them with Putin in the shake hand were taken in Brussels, as well as that they invited the Kremlin leader for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has previously completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be active in four apprenticeships: electronics technicians (three trainees), mechatronics engineers (two), tool mechanic (two) and process mechanic (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years and the trainers will be driving to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees across Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all year rounds is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep the mouth against the mouth and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's main ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has met with disapproval from the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay at his side," he said at great applause.
As a silent gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour workweek in France, despite hesitated demands for a relaxation of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show himself "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered Sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of a renegade socialist deputy and criticising the Socialist Party for taking the French "believing in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the socialist's permanent trench fighting and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has nothing, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
It repeated her party's reputation for a dissolution of parliament and said that she was confident that she would emerge victorious in early elections and was ready for government.
The ruling French party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March, and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll at the Sonntagszeitung Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and the record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion dollars
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cross-country provider in the world, according to connoisseurs in the industry, is leading advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately 3 billion dollars.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of 6.8 billion dollars, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises, as well as its affluent customers, while there is a competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end in fonsequences.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not open to the public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to request comments, while a spokesman for Apollo refused a comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were said to be 2.57 billion dollars in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also set up in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, who together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of 1.2 billion dollars, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is totally around 29 billion dollars and in the next few years it is expected due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers at the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a deal of 850 million dollars in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino merger group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested 1 billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
According to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 percent in the company at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises have 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships together, according to the original application documents for the IPO of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking-loy group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday, which allows only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with members loyal to the Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election and prompted pro-democracy activists to keep their threats ready and paralyze the Hong Kong financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the calls for democracy are spreading to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper that set out China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and organised a sit-in there.
Lis's questioning is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The deputy chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong Affairs Office and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in front of the leadership office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands that Kiev be admitted from "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government can stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the renegade region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area of eastern Ukraine, which is under the control of the separatists, would become part of Russia, but that his status against Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent his rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, is in line with the strategy he seemed to be followed since the beginning of the riots five months ago: help for the separatists to take areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossia region to allow factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Kanal Ein, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were recaptured in March and April after Moscow the Ukrainian Peninsula of Crimea on the 18th century. March had annexed.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area captured as "Novorossiya" or "Novorossianland," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of campaigns Ukrainian politicians, for the elections on 26th Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist areas continue to attack early peace talks "trapped in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, said Peskov.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman for the correction of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, which is home to the majority of the 2 million inhabitants of ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict polls revealed a large majority to remain in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was attracted by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus give the Kremlin the de facto control of an area that connects Russia's territory with Crimea.
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov-on-style area in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko beat in his speech at the inauguration on July 7th. June, that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution, which grant greater control over their finances and the status of languages for the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be sharply opposed to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders followed after another advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks penetrated the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov into eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-backed separatists took over the control of Novoazovsk in a coup, which, according to Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to acquire the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are about to see a point where there is no turning back," said Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in an unsespecialised escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were replaced on Sunday with 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal surrounding Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not feel free from his anger over hackers, who presumably stole images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of the A celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities on the Internet.
The controller in charge probably features 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tributes of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were also reportedly public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The most noble one who had become engaged to Grecko last month said to Confidential: "It is disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "shameful" and that those affected felt "hurt."
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is lying up without a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Liebe ist invinbarbar" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence' told TMZ: "It is a heinous violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen sentenced the hacker in his tweet: "Paving hacked pictures from a cell phone is nothing other than the sale of Hehlerware."
In purely legal terms, the redistributing of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were at their 8th yesterday. Cycling on the Großer Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was an ordeal for one, was an easy workout for the others.
However, everyone agreed on one: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski should have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the brewery storm bike yesterday cycled to the Feldberg.
For good purpose.
He can easily put away the small sore muscles, especially since he participates in the 8th. Cycling on the Großer Feldberg for the help of the association "Help for Children with Cancer" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable insight.
A great thing.
"I now know I can do that - fine!"
Small little little house in the apple curve?
No, if I had stopped, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits in the Oberursel city parliament for the CDU, many of the 718 participants tormented yesterday in the early dew and arrived close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, were easier to cross the more than eleven kilometre long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the district age - red dress, red bike - made something at the start on understatement ("Every lot of professionals, there is arrival the goal!"), but then turned out to be a half professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He also crossed the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press secretary of the city of Oberursel, who had set off together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we like to be there - we would have made a ride today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to Oberursel in the morning to kick back on top.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at home in the morning at 9 o'clock, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolling home with fun.
"Fritten-Toni" was also having fun.
For the head of the Oberursel cult kiosk, bike tours over the Feldberg are simply a part of it.
He had targeted 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
It must also be, because he was on the road with the "fixie bike", these are also racing bikes, but without gearshift...
The fact that it went loosely upwards without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fox Dance to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind them on a cord.
Mountain wake-up doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who ensured safety with his team, equipped with all-wheel-budby and Quad, said: "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh trail, only that he moves the sled himself." The man is therefore his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
