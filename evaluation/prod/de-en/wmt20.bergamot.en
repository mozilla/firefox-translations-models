Fire deleted in French chemical plant
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been erased. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out on Thursday at night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Local residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. Additives for lubricants are produced at the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiool escaped due to a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled widespread after rotten eggs. In 2015, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil were flown into the sewage system of the city after an operational accident.
Woman quits her job to search for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit her job for it. The seven-year-old Border Collie had sailed out of the hotel room during a short break in Montana. For 57 days, every trace was missing from the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I was sick," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went for dinner. When they subsequently returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked dog
Hoping to say that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four or four and a half hours ago," Carole King remembers "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie ran out immediately. Presumably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and views in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days were weeks. "I never give up. I never lost hope," Carole King told Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears were flowing"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a phone call: a man contacted and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She picked the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch was under a tree. "I just embraced them. I didn't want to let them go," King remembered "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flowed. People stopped in their vehicles, got out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found it."
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27. 14 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
With the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them have so far been without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Ministry of Defence, which is classified as a lottery, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of weapons and 3 474 rounds of ammunition have reappeared so far. The weapons and weapons that have still disappeared are six MG3 machine guns, eleven type G3, four G36 rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols. In addition, there are 30 weapon tubes for MG3 machine guns.
The scope of weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr is "frightening," said the member of the Left Party of Parliament, Martina Renner. This is all the more applied, since hardly anything had been found again in the course of investigations. The Left politician spoke of a "needy balance sheet". Renner criticised the fact that the list was not recognizable by the listing whether there was also the one found under the disappeared ammunition that had been found in connection with the investigation against the Bundeswehr officer Franco A, who is under suspicion of terror. "And this even though a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after it was setting by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today, Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. The destination port was indicated in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it continued to remain in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that they wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was on the 19th century. July was attacked by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the sea street of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary setting of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the United Kingdom.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. The merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents with tankers and drones occurred.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU parliamentary group on the forthcoming Day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters. "The horror of the state security was taken away," she said.
Musk aims for delivery record
Tesla's quarter may hold record. Despite delivery boom, there were recent losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it was said in Musk's circular. The challenge is to get the cars quickly to the customers. To this end, Tesla must supplement as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not gained so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, thus achieving its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current quarter and next quarter, six-figure figures have to be achieved. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Riddle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves. This is what scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on why children are so strongly defending themselves against tickling, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a low-lying layer in the cerebrum, which already triggers the laughter when they were tickled up.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they are tickled by humans. This "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-contact
Until now, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touch by others - so people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that the laughter as well as the activity of the area in question are suppressed during a self-contact. This is also true when living beings clean themselves. However, during the touch of others and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse were amplified to laugh.
However, if the self-contact and touching by others at the same time were also suppressed. This suggests that the rat's brain cannot distinguish between self-touching and contact by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves because self-contact activated a brake in the cerebrum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves. They sometimes abandoned this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showing flight behaviour or frightness. This ambivalence is the same as the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of tickling is a behavioural reaction that is equal to rats and people.
Disaster averted: Great fire in French chemical plant deleted
The major fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been erased. This was announced by the Normandy prefecture of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night.
No harmful substances should have stepped out according to the authorities. The rehearsals give no reason to worry, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with around 200 fire-fighting vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticizes by his sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in parliament after the repeal of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to face the country on 31. Brussels should not engage in its calls for changes to the Brexit agreement on October without any agreement. How he wants to achieve this is not clear.
About Cox, who had worked to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: "The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and return this country would be to leave the EU'. Cox was assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum election campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya stops revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in ex honour of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" consists of around 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that thousands of people had taken off in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the cathedral in Oslo.
The project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
The right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had held on the 22nd place. In July 2011, initially detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then dozens of participants from a holiday camp of the Youth Organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party shot on the island of Utöya. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", held in Iran, was able to set sail again. It could be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After being released by the Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, explained head of the shipping company Erik HÃ3nell. Around noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's great that it's over," he told the Swedish TV station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the setting of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a Friday communication.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the tanker on the 19th anniversary of the city. July, on charges of disregarding maritime law rules in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well to the circumstances, said HÃ3nell. They have been professional in the last ten weeks in view of the difficult and gruelling situation. The shipping company is now working to bring it back to its families as quickly as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar behind the fixing of the "Stena Impero": at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which is said to have been intended for Syria, was placed on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery violated EU sanctions against the war land of Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assumptions about finding it a way of bartering to release the "Stena Impero", London vehemently returned.
The Hormuz road is one of the most important sea routes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the world's oil exports are shipped by the strait. Tensions in the region have intensified immensely in recent months. The merchant shipping was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents with tankers and drones occurred.
The nuclear dispute between the two countries is behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had single-handedly withdrawn from the international nuclear deal, which was intended to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been putting pressure on the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter agreement enlarged and other territories. Iran has resisted pressure so far.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and further incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormuz at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protecting powers, wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is blocking its protectionist economic policy into a better future.
India would actually be predestined to become a "war profiteer". Given the punitive tariffs imposed by America’s President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People’s Republic are forced to reschedule. CFOs of Asian companies considering move their production from China to another country call India in a UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. Of course, this does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created to play a more important role in the globally ramified production chain.
But now India itself has come into Trump’s focus. Dedicated to the wholesale in the White House as the "Kingdom of Tariffs", America revoked the emerging country's trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The US is attributing to India prohibitively high tariffs and demand better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, merely a sideshow. Moreover, America looks at the world's most world-biggest democracy through security patterns. Delhi and Washington are combining concern over China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salvo of American punitive tariffs against India seems unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just taken up a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh himself in safety.
The problem, however, is in another place: the empirically corroboped thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult level in the socialist republic of India. Also under modes. His eagerness to reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled every entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies now receive construction permits for buildings faster. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more repressive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for seemingly liquidating firms with high debts more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five years of the modes, a lot of economic looks turned out to be better in India. But this does not apply in trade policy. This encourages internationally less competitive companies to protect against foreign suppliers, the national-conservative government even built new barriers.
In the West, Modi hangs the aura of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows all too well which Western managers vocabulary pleases. At its core, however, the "India First" advocate never moved away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anti-chronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the isolation of their industries are among the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-sighted policy.
Burial of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state would be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the news agency AFP, citing the Chiracs family. The burial will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral service was scheduled in the Parisian Invalidendom, as media reported.
The competitors are brought to the finish: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Championships in Athletics
The world leader has been at the finish line when scenes heartwarmed in the cooled-down Khalifa International stadium. In the first preliminaries of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to oscillate dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his feet a good 300 metres to go, ran in unhealthily bent attitude when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly underpinned him and dragged him to the finish line-up of the last half round of the stadium. The forces were still enough for both to stop the wristwatch running after the finish. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. He avoided shy about it, did not want to talk about his exploitation at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Championships by the World Association. Under normal circumstances he should not have started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this emphatically that evening - and much more intense than he had thought it. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby the lead in the finish and voluntarily took over the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, everything had no use, because the busby, who had only finished with a lot of help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Association at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, had competed to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official dates, this was successful with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. I was before under 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are not best times.
Millionsmic: Egyptians are preparing for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible anti-government protests. An increased police presence was observed in the centre of Cairo on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had already strengthened their street checks and searched the cell phones of pedestrians partly on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested, according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They opposed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic, accusing corruption and mismanagement. There has been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian building contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who moved the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, who played in exile in Spanish in exile, has called for a "million dollar march" in central places in the country today, Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution". The man is not a "gooder for most young Egyptians, because as a subcontractor for the army he spent millions at the time of his or her messages, but his messages arrive.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) held more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed independently. The government did not confirm and comment on the figures either.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily arrested," "just because they were 'at the wrong place at the wrong time'," HRW told arresters, citing lawyers. According to their lawyers, the allegations against the detainees range from "dried off of misinformation" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, were also arbitrarily interviewing passers-by for HRW.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: Mailpage providers should be able to make returns easier
For online retailers, many returned parcels are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the VAT on donations in kind, the ministry explained to a question from the Green parliamentary group, which was reported by the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unstable returns so low that they would have to pay no or only a small sales tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens are returning every sixth package when ordered online. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, the companies would cost companies additional money, because the tax authorities assess donations in kind as a turnover, which then applies to VAT.
Green Group President Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can evaluate non-sales products accordingly and donate to non-profit organisations free of charge. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being penalised for donation. This applies not only to online retail, but also to other stores, from the fashion store to the DIY store.
Banksy Art for Auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Street art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned off.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the regression of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the basic attitude characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is on the 3rd place. October is to be auctioned. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in southwestern Great Britain in 2009, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist once again had the painting exhibited - at the same time as the original Brexit date on the 29th edition of March. On this occasion, the work, which was formerly called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change hands for one millions of euros.
Most recently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange of blow with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons after the abolition of a forced retreat imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to release Brexit on 31. October if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is interfering in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted an image depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the factory every day when entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his leading adviser. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy that. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had severely attacked opponents of the Brexit in parliament in recent days and accused them of "betrayal" on the people. Accusations that he could put the deputies at risk because they could become the target of death threats, he dismissed as a "storm".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest is if MEPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people are upset that Britain has still not withdrawn from the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should talk to each other with respect," said an explanation. "And we should listen to it."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If that goes badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have had to prevent it."
Since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers each dominate a part of Kashmir, and another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy and thus suddenly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding to the current protests in Egypt with a hard time. It has shot at the population with live ammunition, more than 2,000 arrested persons joined in the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting in there. Protesting has never been safe in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi comes to power in 2013, the state apparatus has been doing everything it can to avoid a scenario like in the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, a lack of prospects and the feeling of being stifled by one's own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that does not get to grips with the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how hard it goes against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one in three in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, with inflation at ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who it is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression, but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, and the dilemma in the supermarket is also an old one. It is always critical when large parts of the population have difficulty affording a bottle of water at all.
Tüv exams in the terminal: BER head: no more "showstopper" for capital airport
Two months were checked whether the complicated plant mesh for BER fire protection works together. The operators are satisfied with the progress. But the lance is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Rainer Bretschneider, after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still deficiencies to be processed in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule before commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should not be too large. The construction completion display is now to be submitted to the building authority in the course of the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables have yet to be rectified; the Tüv wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for starting flight operations, it is necessary to continue working intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written notice.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about a lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the dowels on which the cable routes hang. The airport chief expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection does not yet function satisfactorily at the transition to the station under the terminal. The problems had already led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it's about smoke aprons that shut down like a canvas in a fire so that the smoke does not spread. They go down too far. 36 motors must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction defects as well as planning errors have been delaying the opening of the airport for years. It was originally scheduled to go into operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, costs have increased from two billion to an expected 6.5 billion euros to open next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since, those responsible are planning to expand the airport. That is why it is scheduled to take place in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18. October, as the chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors CFO Heike Fölster will be moving to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, head of HR Manfred Bobke-von Camen will be retired next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on solid feet.
Chemnitz: blown up automata for drugs - police takes man
He needed money for drugs - and shot several automatons in the Chemnitz city area into the air! Now the perpetrator is finally in custody!
In the past two years, the number of blown up cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply. There was a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police held a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the production of explosives explosions into united by the factory with a particularly severe case of theft, which were led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion was confirmed against the 33-year-old."
Faced with the new evidence, 33-year-old Chemnitzer now granted a total of eight crimes.
The police spokesman: "With the prey, he has apparently financed his narcotic dependence." The bomber had four times alone between 20. August 2018 and 31. May 2019 parking ticket machines blasted on the Bürgerstraße.
The total damage caused amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in pre-trial detention. The police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic dispersions in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is restraining its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price war with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" is assuming a press secretary for Austrian Airlines on Friday, confirmed to APA. "AviationNetOnline" had previously reported on this.
The base of the Lufthansa seal aircraft Eurowings is therefore de facto dissolved in Vienna. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over these in "Wetlease" from January 2020, including Eurowings staff. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which are to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Lines from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson explained. The flight times are to be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other hand, to expand decentralised transport from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings only serve as a "production company" in Vienna as the company sister of AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight numbers, but primarily with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer being handled in Terminal 1, but in Terminal 3, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
After the Niki-Plöse, a price war broke out at Vienna Airport. Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would not be announced to 16 aircraft in Vienna next summer. The Irish low-cost pilot sends four Ryanair machines including crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticised as a collective treaty bypass.
The challenge of Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years replied on Friday AUA board Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen-granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now marries the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the early month Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is said to have held the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) in the Italy holidays. This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly wait to be actually married," said the pair, who has been meeting since October 2018 according to British media reports, in the official statement.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the years to come with love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos has recorded her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and published it on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information on date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
What is certain, however, is that the marriage of the number nine of the British succession to the throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly great celebration as the marriage of Eugenie on the 12th century. October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes heart failure or an infarction? Hamburg researchers now want to take a close look at the genetic material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
By analysing the genetic material of 9000 people, hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. The Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved in Switzerland.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the most importantly affectable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is insufficiently known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic material of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients of the University Heart and Vessel Centre at the UKE.
Currently, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, it was said by the hospital. Every year there are about 200 added.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in researching other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vessel Centre. New findings on the interplay between the heart and the brain, the heart and the kidney as well as on cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm will to use the data to research other diseases. The foundation's clinic in Davos has so far treated mainly allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine is to be built on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics is to be created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on open heart three years ago in Hamburg and very grateful.
The organic samples of the healthy participants come from hamburgers who are also involved in the "Hamburg City Health Study". According to the hospital, this is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 subjects. When de-decending genetic de-decutterings are strictly paid to the protection of the anonymised data, the scientists assured them. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital of Zurich.
According to the UKE, a person's genetic makeup can be decrypted within 24 hours today. The net purchase costs for this would be 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing in the world, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to be held on the first edition of the All 9,000 samples are expected to be analyzed in October at the end of 2020. Initial results are expected the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. After clues from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still underage, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told. "The victims were abused. Some of them said they had been raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The young were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the protégés were detained by their teachers under "most degrading and inhuman conditions," said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children aged nine, were chained to a small room.
According to the Koran school, the Koran school has existed for about ten years. Residents had drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents were shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had not sensed the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often lack of state institutions. The people of the region suffer frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in Niger's neighbouring state over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, police officers have freed nearly 400 students from appalling backgrounds. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "inhumanity". The officials detained the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation operation.
The children, all boys, were kept at their school like slaves and chained. Some have been sexually abused. Television images showed emaciated and injured students in a recognizably poor state of health.
World footballer's election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopp's freestyle
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association recognizes the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain said that he had never voted in the world footballer election, accusations come to Fifa from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated at all - with a curious reasoning.
Much of FIFA has proven to be disreputable in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans by its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer election has not yet suspected that it would be unleashed - if one disregards the vote that the voting national coach and national team captains of the member associations often vote rather after sympathy than in objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconsistencies are now revealed: Egypt complains that the voices were not taken into account by national coaches Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologises insofar as "the signatures on the election forms were in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answering.
Sudan's coach also surprised
There is also an outcry from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally seen: with Lionel Messi at Platz, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to FIFA, the vote was just as received, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese Association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: "Hear didn't vote for the "TheBest2019 Awards". All the information about my vote is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan Football Association had simply voted in its name.
The association now received the report on Friday: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed voting documents were "mistakenly" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, according to a message from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," the statement said. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are now examining the Fifa in an investigation, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world footballer election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine affair: High-ranking Republicans vote in favour of official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly expressed an official investigation against US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure may result in the president's removal.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. They had shown that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj in a telephone conversation to investigate the activities of the Democratic presidential applicant and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump watch Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticising Trump over the whistleblower affair, and only a few have revealed discomfort. Scott's statements are now a first sign of it in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out in favour of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
As governor of US states, Scott and Baker do not formally have a say in the case against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Your statements are therefore above all symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the Second Chamber of Parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing." US media also report that the first internal cracks are setting up among the Republicans.
The affair could result in the initiation of impeachment proceedings against Trump, the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefits.
There is no precise timetable for the removal procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strain a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a real impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, who are said to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had attacked the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybeian refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also from Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious charges against Rackete are being loud. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were captured in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we cannot exclude any secure information about it ourselves," said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It is about Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and atrocities suspended - through repeated and constant physical violence," said the statement at the time.
NGOs and aid organisations now indicate that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We can't scan who people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is investigated."
Italy's right-wing interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately called for an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk aims at Tesla's delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given its electric car company a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record figures.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to get the cars quickly to the customers. To this end, Tesla must supplement as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not gained so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, thus achieving its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current quarter and next quarter, six-figure figures have to be achieved. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
US budget dispute: Only one bridge financing once again
The new financial year will be held in the USA on 1. October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has had a transitional financing until 21. November decided.
Although US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is facing the figure on 1. October beginning new fiscal year once again without spending plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has had a continuing resolution (CR) until 21. November decided. Without such a decision, a shutdown would have occurred on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the Federal Administration. President Trump has yet to put the decision into force.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the 2019 financial year, which will be ended on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, which will assign the funds to the various departments and authorities. For now, the Federal Administration cannot be found from the 1.3 organic year to 1.4 organic. for the time being. - Expised spending frameworks benefit.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority. However, spending laws reflect Democrat priorities, which have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared ten of the twelve expenditure plans that are hardly capable of more than a majority.
The ghosts are particularly different from the issue of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to try 12 billion. for the construction of the Wall, one of President Trump's great priorities. The Democrats are disturbing the construction of the wall plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military constructions and projects. The dispute over the construction of the Wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The ghosts are divided at the building of the wall
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. An extension of the transitional financing of the transitional financing on the 21st of the 21st of the same weeks more what is more likely than agreeing on all 12 expenditure laws in the  November out. A shutdown is then not excluded.
Against the backdrop of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process are gaining popularity. Template S. In 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the federal administration would automatically continue to the previous year's level, prevent parliamentarians' travel activities and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans were available.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill, according to which all women can claim in vitro fertilisation. This is likely to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister AgnÃ3s Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. They depict the modern family, where there are children with only one parent or homosexual parents. According to their idea, the costs of artificial insemination for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband further forbidden
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which should give widows access to the sperm of her dead man for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and Great Britain, artificial insemination "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, there were cases in the past, in which women complained in vain that the Sperm of a deceased person complained. Opponents of the advance in Paris argued that such a begotten child then wear a "specially difficult fate."
Numerous members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had argued for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed on "double grief" if her wish to have children remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the amendment that has now failed consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of their own partner.
Until now, artificial insemination in France has only allowed heterosexual couples who cannot beget children. You must be married or living together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - however, it is often difficult for single persons or lesbian couples.
Climate settlement payment: calls for flight levy for universities become louder
There is a lot of flown at the universities. That is why the country also wants to have an environmental tax there wants to be held off there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
Universities should also be limited to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about an environmental tax on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is gaining momentum. After the National Nuclear Conference had reacted sceptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities. In a joint declaration, the doctoral students at six Baden-Württemberg universities and a teacher training college plead for the compensation of official flights. This is "urgently necessary" as the first step, while at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, according to their opinion. The cabinet decision, which was originally planned in July, is still on hold, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB secret service, those arrested are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was an exchange of fire between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later died of his serious injuries. However, there were no casualties this time, it was said.
Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic lack of food. The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters. According to the protection of their marine biological resources, the coast guard of Russia drives there, according to its own information on the protection of its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the renewed controls, 30,000 squids were discovered and seized on the boats. According to three fishermen's motorboats and two motorboats, they were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Even after filings by local entrepreneurs, Russia's fishing authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also deplored high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled.
In future only 18,000: USA reduces the approx. asylum ceiling
The "most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is shutting itself off against those seeking protection: as State Department confirms in Washington, the ceiling for the legal influx of refugees is further lowered. In the future, threatened believers and Iraqis will be granted asylum in particular.
The US government wants to once again reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are expected to be allowed into the country, as the US State Department said. In the almost past marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
President Donald Trump's administration has drastically reduced the willingness to welcome protection from around the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher admission limits had been granted.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US Refugee Program in 1980. Nevertheless, the US described the US as the "most relentless and generous nation in history," a formulation that strongly recalls the language of the incumbent US president.
Trump declared a "responsible approach to refugees that the refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there. He is very popular with supporters for his tough course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to cut off. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. It is not clear whether there is a time connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a potentially threatened impeachment procedure.
According to presentation from the Foreign Office, the US government wants to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as can be seen from the statement by the State Department. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be accepted.
The US wants to ensure that people from this "northern triangle" of Central America in particular apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration on the US southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentinean judiciary, an orangutan female has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a reception centre for great apes in the USA. The "Sandra", who was born in 1986 in the zoo in Rostock, was awarded the rights of a "non-human person", so their release was compulsory. The animal was moved to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday night - not as a passenger, but in the cargo hold, as lawyer Andrés Gil DomÃ3nguez explained.
Since the 53-kilogram human epidemic is unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, it is to live in the outdoor enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", formerly a pet by pop star Michael Jackson. Before moving into Florida, however, "Sandra" has yet to stand through an approximately 40-day quarantine at Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandra's" fundamental rights initiated by animal rights in 2014 by animal rights in 2014 has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and educational facility to preserve biodiversity is to be created there.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded a new hussar ride at the almost 3000-meter-high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double soil or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north face of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute fraud, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. With this he beat the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north faces.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The US sports manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits, regardless of the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the quarter under review (almost 1.3 billion euros). That is 25 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The main reason for this is the new "Nike Direct" marketing strategy, with which the Adidas competitor is directly contacting its customers online.
Sales rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. The Nike sales figures were the most strongest in China, with an increase of 22 percent. As a result, the Group of Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to be directed directly to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
CFO Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors responded pleased with the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Jesus of AS Rome has banned a lifelong stadium from the Italian capital because of racist comments on football prose Juan Jesus of AS Rome. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been verbally abused by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "You already know what you should do with such a fan. NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rom since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He has reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters may never attend a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw them out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The cause of the statement was racist songs at the first division match between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz on the previous Sunday.
But there were also late discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 riot fans of record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are not likely to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. The rest therefore apply prohibitions of four to seven years.
Fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, with severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had moved the investigation with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are to be behind the black trade in tickets. They would have "military controlled" the ticket deal for the fanking curve and should have extorted Juventus employees to get cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with catchy names. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective attitude to life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" With this call started on 21. September officially the crab fishing at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, thus also making the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was ushered in as announced by the Public Relations Department of Nanjing-Gaochun County Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also home to the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions from ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its residents all the conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun started breeding crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a formative industry that ensured high incomes and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as technology-supported crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting greater efficiency in agriculture and farmers' incomes.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform to "Distribution of Power, Optimization of Administration and Official Services" and has carefully established the service network for "Applicants under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending". The city wants to comprehensively optimise the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the local advantages through the connection to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a figureheadmark to locate intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors, and organic farms. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism zone and tourist destinations of national importance, which comprises all areas. The ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun landscape were integrated, the state of the buildings for citizen services and for the public sector were comprehensively improved, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ tourism" were further developed and the development of cultural tourism were further developed at a high level of quality. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
On his return, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani spoke of the UN General Assembly of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions. The United States had promised an end to all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, said Ruhani on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift up the sanctions imposed on it so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the events as follows: Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had weathered for a meeting to be held. "And America says I am raising the sanctions," Ruhani added. The nature of the penalties that were to be brought to an end have been discussed. "And they have clearly stated that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this advance was not made in an acceptable way, Rouhani criticized. In view of the current penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Iran with Russia and China. This is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Rouhani will meet with US President Donald Trump, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Rouhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey has been shaken by two earthquakes in a very short time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This is growing concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The 5.8 earthquake on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quitting, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential houses plunge into it - among other things, crumbs made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which were registered in the centre as refuges, have long been built. Only on the 20th The Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineering warned on the anniversary of the Gölcük camp in August that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of the earthquake in Thursday was located in the Sea of Marmara off the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometres, as the civil protection authority Afad announced. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu announced on Twitter that injuries or damages had not been reported at first. The state channel TRT showed people who were running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought in the Silivri district for safety reasons. Some students cried as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest earthquakes in 1999 was near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when the earthquake occurs is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul were already hit again.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have so-called go-bags ready to stand next to the front door, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. It is not clear when the next big earthquake will come.
On his return from New York, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that eight people had been injured. Some buildings suffered slight damage. The mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to this, two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In social networks, many users report panic. Buildings shake. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than Tuesday's, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned about aftershocks via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the earthquake is officially provided as at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an aftershock, which was indicated with a magnitude of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shied away from the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Its epicentre was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a rain warning. It had become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the transmitter. "Before or later the big quake will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great worries in Istanbul. In Albania, there was a violent earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. The earth had also shaken on Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents are causing new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. Towards a possible impeachment procedure, the US Democrats are encouraged to entrust themselves to the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president's important evidence of investigations against the president. Trump himself once again sees himself as victims of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the whistleblower's credibility.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - redirected to flyer
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight has been redirected from United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked from Washington to San Francisco during flight in 1554, the airline said, according to the US media.
With an unscheduled stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be exempted from the narrow cabin. She was imprisoned in it for about an hour, U.S. media, citing other passengers. For the onward flight to San Francisco, passengers had to change the plane.
In a video distributed on the internet, which according to US media is supposed to come from flight 1554, it can be seen how several people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, Okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologised to all passengers. It was initially open whether the woman receives compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be released on 27. Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced in German in November. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams" who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but is now now the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into practice and is wildly determined to let nothing and not stop one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers actually admit the catastrophe of a no-deal in high positions - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to this: write". McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel "Maschinen wie ich" about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first published story in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees "being transformed into an uncherished vermin", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that is heading," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's rail infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron will be modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authority, this will make travel more convenient and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has departed all trips up to and including 31 one day after his petition for insolvency. October 2019 cancelled. Travel could "not be contested for insolvency law reasons," the company announced on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid in full. How to get to travel with start from the 1. The company is open on November 2019, which was open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the wake of the bankruptcy of the British parent company and had filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers wants to transfer money back to hotels
On the other hand, hotels abroad, which are currently still hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance from this Friday. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked to make extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments in the resorts, as an Zurich spokesperson from the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are neither requested or otherwise confirmed for the individual payment of hotel invoices or otherwise certifies them," said Martin Bernd Engelien.
The insurance thus responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodations themselves on the ground. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Organisations had sharply criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be voted on Friday with the insolvent tour operator, said the insurance spokesman. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook Pauschal holidaymakers from Germany were still on the road. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and returns from Thomas-Cook customers.
Bankruptcy administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution to the future.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travellers who are still on the road. It looks bad for Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on holiday. Late Thursday evening, the company announced all trips up to and including 31. October would be cancelled. This also applies to those bookings that have already been paid.
How to get to travel with start from the 1. The company is open on November 2019, which was open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was said. In principle, the Zurich insurance company is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the Kaera company. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing the commitment of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa, he is now following in the footsteps of his mother.
Dressed in a blue splinter protective vest, the British prince Harry has ignited and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Close to a camp by the British halo trust at the town of Dirico, he established the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of the TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded in the savannah landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his journey to Africa, Harry wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same blast master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to cover the way she went then. The pictures of Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa since Monday, which has begun in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Shower Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had actually clearly committed himself: he will not guarantee a third delay in the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are of eternal duration with the polarizing Brit. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Britain floats over the blonde head like a sword of Damocles. His suspension of parliament to stubbornly held his Brexit etude by the date of departure was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by parliament obliges Johnson to do so in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31. to effect on October an extension of the bilateral talks. However, Johnson had repeatedly ruled out that.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal possible
But the pressure does not seem to be noticeably missed by Johnson either. In the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he suggested that he supported an extension of the negotiations in the event of a non-agreement until the end of October:
You know, we will keep to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this works.
And time is gradually running out of Brexit negotiator in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But the recent talks have not yet achieved a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a renewed postponement of the exit date is in force. However, the opposition does not believe the Prime Minister's words. She fears that in the event of a no-deal, Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit.
US Authority: Other Deaths from E-Cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the US has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injured in this context, the US health authority told CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 people affected, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of the lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage is known. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos were shared millions of times by Mohammed Ali in online networks. The building contractor and actor living in Spain is calling for a "people's revolution". Today, Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, accusing by critics of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass demonstrations with one million participants in central places in the country.
The security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was already observed. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed. In recent days, the police had increased their roadside checks and searched the cell phones of pedestrians partly on news and photos related to the protests.
On the 20th In September, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted hard. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - just because they were "at the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW told arresters, citing lawyers.
The organisation also criticised censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has been ruling the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of the government, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and sometimes convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. On his arrival in the port of Hamburg, he was welcomed by skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
In recent months, Fuchs had investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He had been waiting for the young generation to speak for years. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens at sea often takes place in secret," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the oceans. During the expedition, it was said, among other things, surveyed glacier ice with a drone of Greenland ice and fished with nets after microplastics.
The polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "fight for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have happened in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: Tourist women payed 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guidebooks in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this cannot be found in the invoice. A tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the innkeeper.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? After the turbulent revelations of recent days, US President Donald Trump may indeed be faced with impeachment, the Democrats now want to examine this with their House of Representatives investigation as quickly as possible - there is talk of weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The accusation of the whistleblower who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint from concern for national security and for US democracy is monstrous: the president has absused the power of his office to exploit another country's government for an influence on the 2020 election. He had exploited Ukraine's dependence on extortionately and wanted to force it to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be traced in the transcript of the discussion with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the full text. The telephone conversation of the 25th July, however, is only an episode of a much bigger story, which focuses next to Trump on his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public perspective in May 2019, when the New York Times reports from Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected president Zelensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We don't get involved in a choice, we interfere with an investigation, to which we have the right to do," he told the newspaper. One might think it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my client and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have become infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies, which are fixated on Trump's opponent in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for the Russia investigations in the US. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is about precisely the investigation that Trump will talk so prominently with Selensky on the phone in July. The version of Giulianis and the president reads: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidacy, Joe Biden, had pushed as the Obama administration's Ukrainian commissioner for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Schokin. This is to stop the investigation of the gas company, which he was responsible for, and his supervisory board included his son Hunter Biden. Biden senior had financially extorted Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt machinations.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General be had to go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, and Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Shokin was also accused of deeply corrupt behaviour, the US government was by far not the only Western partner to push for his release. Incidentally, the Obama administration even expressly supported the investigation into the company.
Disorders of Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. Germany, Great Britain and Spain are therefore particularly affected. On the website alledistören.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded since around 3.30 pm. Instagram also displays the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not to date on the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by faults
It is not the first massive incident this year. The services had already been cancelled in March and July for several hours. And as in previous cases, users are primarily taking back on Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were on their way with a rubber boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for salvage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the news, just before ten we started, and a good 20 minutes we were later over the inflatable boat".
Poland has been running the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, and 19 scientists are working there. The deferred researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have finally come on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall another study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery to
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only absorbs capacity, but also does not last so long overall. The service life is therefore lower. The researchers therefore advise you to always charge the smartphone using a cable. Since a battery replacement for modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has even increased the cost of recovering batteries - for all iPhones.
Practically
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply putting the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of cable clothing and laborious connector bumblebee. Since Qi (is inductive energy transmission) is a global standard enforced, in which Apple even participates exceptionally, there are hardly any restrictions. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight-thousanders in six months
According to a Nepalese mountaineer, a Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the peak of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, announced his expedition operator.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has made international headlines before: a viral photo of mountaineers who queue on Mount Everest comes from him in the spring.
The image of the massandrang triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peaks on earth. In May, eleven climbers had died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climb of the 14th Eight-thousanders will: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is bad weather. At the beginning of week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman told on Friday. "We assume that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists earlier rock fort Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
Almost 200 elephants are killed every year in Sri Lanka. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This usually happens when the animals migrate through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants in Sri Lanka. In theory, the death penalty is based on their killing.
Serious British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran. According to the IRNA news agency, the Maritime Office of Bandar Abbas announced this. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had the British-fly-sailing tankers on 19th. July, on charges of disregarding maritime law rules in the Persian Gulf.
Management by Thomas Cook in criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook comprehensively. This will be about the Executive Board's salary packages as well as the question of why the British government did not like to financially jump in to the company struggling to survive. "We are interested in supervising the company as well as control by external auditors," said the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Apparently we are dealing with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes at the risk of colorectal cancer are overestimated
The role of genes in the increased inhabited colorectal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits weigh more difficult than previously assumed. The DKFZ scientists emphasise that this has consequences for calculations of the individual colorectal cancer risk.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in a email published by the industry blog "Electrek" on Thursday (local time) to Tesla employees. The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, continued it in Musk's circular.
The challenge is to get the cars quickly to the customers. To this end, Tesla must supplement as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trading with an increase of over six percent. The price has not gained so much for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, thus achieving its previous record.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current quarter and next quarter, six-figure figures have to be achieved. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been recent losses.
Does the British Government Should Bypass Brexit Law? Johnson restrained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a lot of attention to whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the law, which was recently passed by parliament, against an unregulated Brexit. In response to a question, he merely told journalists on Friday that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that would make the negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to post-EU entry into force of the law.
Johnson said he sought a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU is on 31 January. To leave October, and the best way is to be reached with an agreement".
Iran apparently ramps up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European contracting parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show incompetence or unwillingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rouani at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday. In the event that they do not wear their promises, he promised "further steps" away from the agreements of the painstakingly negotiated 2015 agreement.
The background to this is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US single-handedly stepped out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran to change its course in Middle East policy considered aggressive with "maximum pressure." President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now relying on tough sanctions against Tehran. Iran recently responded with a recovery of the uranium enrichment limited in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium. According to IAEA, Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not prepared to bear their part of the deal, and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of severing US sanctions, Kautani suspected. However, there will be further discussions, which hopefully would provide a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran into attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the mixed situation changed after an attack on an important oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the UK followed the US assessment on Monday that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had committed themselves to the attack, but this was seen by the US as a wrong commitment. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani affirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence," said Rohani. However, the European leaders would not have skillfully skillfully in the talks with him during the UN debate. Instead, they would only invoke that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out an attack like this. In recent days, Rouhani met with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions imposed by the US administration would first be lifted, Rohani demanded. He called on the government in Washington to switch to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of space. This was achieved first of all. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only assumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The well-travelled comet was on the 30th anniversary of the company August was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennady Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, which was viewed during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into another solar system up close before it disappears unlikely. Initial observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reported. "The present velocity of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which at this distance is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Administration (Nasa) reported in a statement.
According to the analyses, the comet is on a so-called hyperbolic pathway, which leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) said. She is also responsible for the naming and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honour of his discoverer, the interstellar comet, which had initially been listed under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was already viewed in the approach. This means that the researchers stay for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that, until October 2020, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team led by Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/Oumuamua, in an initial study determined the diameter of the celestial object to 2 to 16 kilometres. Images of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained an initial spectrum of the interstellar tail star that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de LeÃ3n. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form similar processes as in our supplement, de LeÃ3n's colleague Javier Licandro.
According to the IAU, the discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such flash visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency wants to deploy the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (German: Comets Interceptor) on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth until 2028. According to Esa science director Günther Hasinger, it is said to either wait for an still untouched, fresh cometry from our own solar system, or to an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just in time before the 70th. The birthday of the People's Republic has come: The first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers are to be handled annually at the new airport, and in 2025 it is expected to be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project. The most recent prestigious project in China is also called the "Star of Sea" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be extended to seven and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new sub-new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006, has been repeatedly postponed. In other words, after four years, a first passenger plane landed in Beijing.
New supersonic aircraft to fly 2030: from London to Sydney in four and a half hours
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - from this the British space agency dreams. A special engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is targeted for the 2030s, is intended to make this supersonic flight designed for the 2030s a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is developing the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish that," said Agency head Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s in favour of commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
To drive the project forward, the British space agency wants to work more closely with the Australian industry. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. The Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until it was closed in 2003, taking three to three to three hours and three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred when a Concorde was launched at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, killing all 109 passengers. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space agency Nasa, the "X Plan". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in its programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines on his homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, enabling the "next generation of truly reusable cream moving devices".
Riot in Washington: Trump wants to track down anonymous tipters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump told US commissioners at the United Nations in New York on Thursday. The person concerned is almost "a spy" and in the past one had dealt with "a little different" than today.
This was considered an intimidation attempt against the host. The event was actually not public. However, several US media spread audio recordings from the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outraged at the President's statement.
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for impeachment against Trump on Tuesday. Their allegations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer who makes serious accusations against Trump and its administrative headquarters. On large public pressure, the whistleblower's whistleblower had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the US president "use the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes in its favour in the 2020 US election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterpart to investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about former businesses of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from Ukrainian justice. Biden is at the forefront of the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election.
The whistleblower also blamed the White House for the Ukraine telephone copy: leading government officials tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the screen. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was prepared. After the conversation, however, this was removed from an usually designated database after the conversation, lawyers from the White House and instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough call has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was a member of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again called into question the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" spread from a second hand that had proved to be incorrect. Therefore, there may be no tipters or spies.
How Trump expressed himself in New York about those who are said to have leaked information to the whistleblower, but caused outrage. The chairman of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted worried and complained that Trump's statement once again violated the integrity of the government.
Various investigations have been underway in various committees in various committees in the House of Representatives for months and its environment. Faced with the Ukraine allegations, the Democrats are now pushing forward with new forces to launch a possible impeachment against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump picked up the ship, accused him of misrepresenting things and again called for the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials from the security and foreign policy spheres, who were mostly among democratic, but also under Republican presidents, supported the investigation launched by the Democrats for a possible impeachment procedure in a statement published on Friday. If the accusations were to come true, it would be "a ruthless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could urge a so-called impeachment process. However, the decision on a real impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW Works Council: Jobs are being "creeping" cut
The VW brand's plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driven by the car manufacturer's works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs of ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved this year as early as this year.
One key to this is the personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and works councils in 2016 already envisages the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a workplace can only be dismantled at the car manufacturer if it is almost proven that the associated activities are no longer required. In addition, employment security is valid until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production that are not actually upholding are being "creeping" about another way - i.e. passing the official course. Thus, regular vacancies often would not be reoccupied.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forced restitution. Meanwhile, staff lack in many places, the work compression increase, the worries about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would become greater. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. From VW, it was only said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment takes place as agreed socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardise production even more globally and centrally manage new projects. This is also intended to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production director Andreas Tostmann said at a manager's conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the impending trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crisis-proof."
There are already successes on this path: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. In front of journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which was held on 24. October in Wolfsburg will be presented to shorten by 1.1 hours. VW does not mention exact figures on the production time, according to information our newspaper it is 7 round at the Golf
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb applies internally to VW that 800,000 cars have to be built there every year for the plant to be satisfactory profitable. In 2018, however, capacity utilization in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems of switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas testing process.
As Chief Production Officer Tostmann announced last year, however, one million cars are to roll off the production line in Wolfsburg "perspectively". This is intended to make it possible to bundle the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is giving golf production through the conversion to the location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, sales of Golf and Tiguan were declining recently. Therefore, expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. Despite all his efforts to build e-mobility, it is to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburg residents for the time being.
Forced to prostitution with Voodoo: Manor sentences
Young women from Nigeria have been oathed, smuggled into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to suspended sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had smuggled young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitute. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerians who are who had to leave a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest who had to leave their trips.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean inflatable with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. Having arrived in Germany, they were distributed among various brothels to process the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25,000 euros. They were therefore completely accepted.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the infiltration and the subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to do," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann during the delivery of the verdict. "Some were correctly disgusted."
The judgments are based on commercial and bandage infiltration of foreigners, human trafficking, holding and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
The flight attendant's union Ufo has once again threatened to strike FIm long-term dispute with the Lufthansa Group.
If the company did not return to the negotiating table, the union "on 14" will "on 14. informing about the industrial action in the LH Group in October,” announced under the Ufo Contract Board Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been opposed to conduct collective bargaining for months. This also concerns the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to show that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court dismissed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and considered appealing against it. "I think it is unlikely that a second court sees the matter completely differently," said Ufo Board of Management Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the State Labour Court of Frankfurt in order to have the status of UFOs as a trade union reviewed. The company argues that the union has not installed a member of the board for months and is therefore not in a position to fill its role as a collective bargaining partner.
This was preceded by a fierce leadership dispute in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board and the advisory board have resigned, including the long-standing union head Nicoley Baublies. Because of the doubts about its management, the UFO had suspended a ballot vote on strikes by the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet. But that is now to change. The land on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa provisions.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors wanted to increase to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission had announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historical moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is now difficult for tourists to access. Visas are usually only awarded for short business trips, religious pilgrimage or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the following, national oil production collapsed drastically, the oil price shells. It is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram stories, where she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a hen party in Los Angeles according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits printed with bananas, among other things, on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to get married church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes in a New York registry office a year ago. There had not been a larger festival at that time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you cannot have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people have died in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin, the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64 year old man.
The authorities had been looking for the plane since Thursday evening after the crew had sold an emergency signal via GPS. A military helicopter was also used in the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also caused by the threat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are at risk. 66 would already be at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "strengthened", "threatened with extinction" and "death in nature" to "external". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Merry and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat represents the Balkan-Miniermotte next to a fungus. It has been spreading from south-eastern Europe across the continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to be less than 10,000. The trees in cities, parks and avenues are not taken into account in this assessment.
Shrub species and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European Redlists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wilderness, inaugurated species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake off Istanbul: 34 Injured Reported
34 people have been injured in the recent earthquake in Turkey. According to the data, there was no death. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The 5.8 earthquake on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region off Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis of millions.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for quitting, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly earthquake-prone. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicentre was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira show on the halftime show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It won't become greater," Shakira wrote to a photo of himself and Lopez. She is incredibly excited to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On the 2nd February 2020 will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the half-time show. “Now it’s still special because the NFL exists for 100 years and I will perform with another Latina”. She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honoured to be on one of the largest stages in the world alongside another artist and represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" are on stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling viewers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the USA. Even if you were last decreasing numbers of spectators, this February the spectacle in the USA attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been turmoil around the half-time show of the past Super Bowl in advance: Last February, according to media reports, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to occur in the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 took the half-time show - the reviews were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had hit the national anthem in the 2016/17 season before NFL games in the national anthem in protest against police violence and racism. Kaepernick triggered a movement with his protest, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, and US President Donald Trump sharply attacked the mostly African American football stars. Kaepernick himself has been clubless since March 2017 and has not played an NFL part. He accuses the clubs not wanting to hire it for political reasons.
Cook-Pküre: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to be expensive. There is a risk of high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected by this, writes the Financial Times in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would like to have write-downs of up to 1.8 billion pounds on their books (around 2 billion pounds). Euro) said the report. Estimates by the consulting firm AlixPartners would have shown this.
The creditors of bonds would have to write-downs of between 900 million and 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million. Take pounds in. The actual wacky amounts are likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, an expert told the paper.
How large the losses of the creditors will actually be will be, will become apparent after the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not spread too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor positions. The sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand could probably be made the most money, it continued.
Rackete is said to have brought alleged murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are said to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we cannot exclude this, but we cannot have secure information about it himself," said the spokesman of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they were leaving on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had found on 29. June illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa and rammed a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects should have arrived there. Investigations are underway for aiding and abetting illegal immigration.
USA warn federal government before Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network supplier Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company to follow instructions from the security bodies "under Chinese jurisdiction."
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC head. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of trust from suppliers".
Berlin initially wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not only made up of the hardware:
The software in particular is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that changes over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency would be able to check each individual update in real time to track security risks," the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei contributing to the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership conditions are opaque. The employee company that supposedly owns the company is not necessarily independent from the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
The US has insights into which government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the position of the USA.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, local residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours - but the clean-up may now last days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and nurseries in the region are closed.
The facilities would not open as a precaution on Friday in twelve municipalities, the responsible prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to suspend the smoke. There were no casualties. Farmers and breeders were called upon to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire was completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture told. According to the prefecture, the prefecture is still at stake that after deletion, there is still a risk of spreading. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were deployed at the fireplace.
A gigantic black smoke column had previously been shaped from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which produces additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to the authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in rehearsals at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine cannot be ruled out. In the river dams were built up against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out around 2:40 a.m. in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany needs to invest now'
French Economics and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We cannot wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions."
Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany, that those states which have fiscal room for more investment.
France does not have these room for manoeuvres, adding the minister and referred to the high level of public debt of his country. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French public debt must be "stabilized" and "refuelled", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly made appeals to Germany to make more public investments to stimulate the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow Vest Movement. New debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, after an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson sharply criticises the "Capitulation Law" passed by Parliament.
The parliament is back, a law dictates to the British prime minister to avoid a Chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician evades this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping a loud background on whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law scheduled last passed by parliament to prevent exactly what exactly that is to prevent. In response to a question, Johnson merely told journalists that his government would comply with the law.
The law stipulates that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU has been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that would make the negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law after the EU leave. Johnson said he sought a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU is on 31 January. To leave October, and the best way is to be reached with an agreement".
Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, declares that he considers the political disputes over Brexit to be a "walk in the park" and was confident that the aim to leave the EU will come to pass: "We are enjoying this, we will win, we will be (note(at) ed.: from the EU) do not worry," Cummings told the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book launch.
Cummings, who headed the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, is now acting as chief strategist in the British government seat of Downing Street. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into an almost hopeless situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" is delving deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the illustrated book "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch Event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the immediate magic of Polaroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made them, a few hundred of whom are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one else is at the centre of attention: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, speaks on his head in a bathrobe with a bag or wears shaped moonoats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also had a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in southern England or in Scotland. According to the BBC, Mary McCartney said that as a baby she had slept in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it hasn't always been troubled by the McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about making the click: You have to realize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you have to snap it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you snap two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always catching just the right moment. "She just knew she did," Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image section and the colours, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but is also a great aesthetic pleasure in addition to every anecdotal, where landscapes sometimes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the newly launched Beatles album "Abbey Road", which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from its neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not drop out of oil and gas import from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, because some companies had "withdrawn because of the US threats."
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish president, who repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its withdrawal from the international nuclear deal with Iran, the US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the US, Iran is secretly following a nuclear program and does not stick to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months, tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US government wants to restrict refugee taking in
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The US State Department declared on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said that the US would continue to see itself obliged to support refugees. The most important task, however, is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the US government wants to focus on the admission of two groups of refugees: people who are being persecuted for their beliefs - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as emerges from the State Department's statement. Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be accepted.
The programme launched in 1980 refugees from UN camps around the world are selected and resettled in the USA. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the programme's history. The current ceiling of 30,000 is already a low value. When US President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted shocked to the announced reduction in the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, head of the International Rescue Committee. The US would continue to damage its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the US - legally and illegally. According to the US government, the US government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Coming near a spy"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has paid corresponding clues to the whistleblower who presents his abuse of power, "gets close to a spy," said Trump, according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several US media reports on this.
According to this, Trump spoke to staff of the American UN mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This comes close to a spy." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Correct. The spies and betrayals, we used to be a little different from what we do now."
Observers assessed the latter remark on a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticised Trump's statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It was also an attempt to obstruct a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairs of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
In a complaint now published, the whistleblower accuses the president of having abused his office to ask for another country's interference in the US election in 2020. Specifically, it is a question of his controversial telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selensky this summer: in the conversation, Trump urged him to initiate investigations into his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower itself and its informants are. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is a analyst of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat capsized: baby and infant drowning in Aegean
People keep trying to come to Greece via the Aegean Sea from Turkey. The often far too small boats regularly capable of being much. Seven migrants have now died when a rubber boot is sinking - including five children.
Several migrants were killed in front of the Greek island of Chios when a rubber dinghy died. Among the deaths are a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Accordingly, four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods of the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also said to be a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not yet known from which states the migrants originate. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, usually in far too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who break off concert
A US concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end because of an auspiciousness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to work. In the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it is still going on."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for excuse and added that Daltrey "now couldn't speak really". Townsend promised the audience to get their money's worth at a concert redress. However, no date has been set yet.
The Who cancelled for Friday in Dallas and scheduled performances for Sunday in Denver. They are to be made up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly set: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is moving from a small startup to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Renters have to fear billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork is in danger of disrupting the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. A few days ago, the company had sold founder Adam Neumann as head, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and assets such as the private jet for executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports, among others, that WeWork has stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect. This makes New York and London the largest tenant of office space suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office space for the long term and rents it out to members in some small units at short notice. These can be individual freelancers, small start-ups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork has burned money at breathtaking speed with this business. Last year, the company suffered a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year, rental costs alone are said to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars as a result of renting ever new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new company management is now to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new space with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with a term of up to 15 years, which result in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert calculated by Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, rented almost 300,000 square metres of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the spaces that had come onto the market at the time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office vacancy in the US metropolis would have increased during this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". The situation is similar in London, where WeWork now operates several dozen office locations in the best location.
In the British capital, too, the balance in the real estate market could push itself noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, an office building purchased by the savings bank fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros last year in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the hoped-for billions in revenues. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork, despite the long-term leases. This is because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by subsidiaries founded, so-called special purpose vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again seized numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of another 262 poachers who had been fished illegally in the waters had been arrested, according to the Russian Insertion Intelligence Service FSB to the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot at and three of them had been injured. This time there were no casualties, it was said. Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic lack of food.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore in Russian territorial waters. According to the protection of their marine biological resources, the coast guard of Russia drives there, according to its own information on the protection of its marine biological resources. 30,000 squids were discovered in the renewed controls. According to three fishermen's motorboats and two motorboats, they were confiscated and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Novosti, the Coast Guard noted more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian fisheries authority had not issued fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year even after the complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been temporarily arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorye, Georgi Martynov, recently also deplored high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with close-meshed synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, even small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need 200 years to be dismantled. The ships themselves also do not correspond to the hygienic and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were violated during the arrests last week. According to the FSB, an equally wounded North Korean died of his injuries. On that 17th In September, Russian border guards first detained a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened the fire.
USA imposes entry ban against ex-president Castro
The United States has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President RaÃol Castro and his children. The US Department of State justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "gross human rights violations." As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he proposes a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also complicit in human rights violations through the support of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The violence of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump issued travel bans on Wednesday against members of the Venezuelan government and the military, among others. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The US has imposed a whole range of sanctions on Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan GuaidÃ3 to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest ally. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of posted doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress the government.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time shift, before the protests across Europe to North America were taking place. Climatic activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Demonstrators also wanted to gather in front of the White House in Washington.
How great the global response will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday, more than four million people have hit the climate. This Friday we'll do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, it has supplemented.
Especially in Germany, the influx of Friday was very strong. According to estimates by Fridays for Future, a good third of all global demonstrators - around 1.4 million had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to the movement, rallies are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to take to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15 at the time, Thunberg had taken action before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on their country's politicians to a greater commitment to climate protection. This has resulted in the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests are primarily involved in pupils and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politicians in the fight against Earth healing and the threat of climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Nearly a month ago, after a two-week transatlantic trips, Thunberg arrived in New York with a deep-sea racy yacht. There she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke urgently into the consciences of the Earth's leader. In her native Stockholm, she was awarded the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people of Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is something envisaged in the fire protection system. "This also applies to smoking," according to the Tass agency, according to the Tass agency, a spokesman for the Emergency Ministry in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is scheduled to be imposed on the 1st October come into force.
Anyone who smokes nevertheless has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette ignites a fire, then the punishment will be higher. According to the ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat skewers on the balcony is no longer permitted.
Blow against cybercriminals - investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time excavated a large server provider for illegal business in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through which internationally acting criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Attorney General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspect are said to have been the operator of the world's second largest darknet marketplace for drugs, "Wall Street Market", among others - investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016, according to the public prosecutor's office, was also controlled by a server in the cyber bunker.
Such a hoster had been excavated for the first time in Germany, it was said. A web host provides the infrastructure for a website.
During the access campaign with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigation. At noon, the investigators want to inform further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands and thousands of people want to take to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests - Who are Thunberg's backers?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm up the climate. All the more astonishing that another 16-year-old girl holds the mirror in the face of the power man of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and leads young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win over a collection of children and young people. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt chosen to promote a more just world. At that time, he was also able to win over a host of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to reach the promised land, similar to how Greta Thunberg recently made its trip to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this respect? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold far-reachingly, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Even veteran followers from Greta Thunberg were a little indignant about the last PR show, or the journey by boat was probably also put too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into its own worldwide very well in the media and a lot of money flows thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits are now divided: Is it morally correct to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work with brokers during the world rescue operation? No matter what position is ultimately taken in this, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy thrives on various opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to critically question seemingly pious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - The researchers only suspected it for a long time, but now they have certainty: a comet of another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The body was discovered in Crimea by an amateur astronomer named Gennady Borisov. He looked with a self-made telescope to the sky and further follow-up confirmed his first suspicions. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind to be seen on the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into an alien solar system from close day. Apparently, the Kommet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hypergrape pathway that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been spotted before the touch - and can be observed for several months
But before the time comes, astronomers can observe it in depth. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in his approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and will then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Administration (Nasa). "After that, until October 2020, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on Comet 2I/Borisov arouse hopes in science
According to the initial findings, the comet is estimated at a diameter of 2 to 16 kilometres. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comet - because as the IAC researcher Julia de LeÃ3n puts it, the spectrum of the comet is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form similar processes as in our supplement, de LeÃ3n's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual findings. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid stopped past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson shocked by brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. Only his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister castigates with clear words the prime minister's language as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Scam", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbally. At Question Time in the House of Commons this Wednesday, there was a massive outrage of the opposition, and now other critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister, Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother was using words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, long-pulnated, four-covered, tarred and trapped". It considers this to be extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who had competed in the EU Parliament elections for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
She was particularly sudden when her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly department of lower house who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 referendum. The best way to honour their memory is to be said that they were to be dragged through Brexit had said. "It is very distasteful to refer to a deputy who was murdered by someone calling 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the far-right camp, which felt encouraged "by this kind of language". For all those who mourn them, it was very tasteless.
The widower of Cox also sharply criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honour them is to be passionate and determined for what you believe in - no matter what view you are. But one should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had emerged in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and the national interest in recent months - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson explained the step.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they said: "In recent days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside Parliament. We should talk to each other with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is sending a strong signal in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the midterm show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl Latina power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will be delivering the half-time show at the upcoming US football league NFL final. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo. Because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which were held in the coming year 100. Birthday celebrates, takes place on 2. February in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka" comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be shown in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She made her whole breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the midterm guests is eagerly awaited in the USA every time. This year, many also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump’s immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sporting event and a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, well over 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is now also extremely popular in Germany.
Political controversy occurred in the run-up last year. The reason for this was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise up in the playing of the national anthem in protest against police violence and had been tackled hard by US President Donald Trump, among others. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 occurred was ultimately criticised by many.
An actor and Youtuber is attracting Egyptian rulers: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the time being.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood flows again on the streets of Egypt, they both spent the past week abroad. One of them returned to Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who spent the 2013 Muslim Brother Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's action against political Islam and had not lost a syllable about the human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people for daring to protest the president. He had "no reason to worry," Sisi said at the airport into the microphones of state television. "The Egyptians cannot be misled."
In the opinion of the president, this is what the other man who is currently determining the events on the streets is trying to be misled. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he evaded the grip of the security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafés, living rooms and tea rooms: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets", Ali calls on his fellow countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite a rustic language. While the people are starving, the president sniffed in luxury and can be built magnificent new palaces, they say. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with exactly this guy for 15 years in his second job as a building contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click numbers show.
After thousands of people had been arrested for the first time since Sisi's grip after power and arrested almost 2000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for a "millionic march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would venture onto the streets. But there were isolated smaller protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in the village of Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure. In these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos could not be independently verified at first. From security circles it was said that the police had ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators tore banners with the portrait of the president to touches last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo, several metro stations in the city center were closed due to "maintenance works," most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And on Rabaa Square, where supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Morsi barricaded themselves in 2013, until the army took it under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent discontent from gathering discontent: Sisi's Future Party wanted to hold a major rally for the president here, of all places.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal does not have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not crash with police officers." However, this cannot be understood as a retreat: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various check options.
Anyone who signs an Internet contract does not need blindly trust the speed details of the providers. Customers can even check how much of it is actually achieved in the event of abnormalities.
Finally, the transfer rates promised in advance are a contractual component and should therefore be reached, explains the consumer association Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options. The measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure actual data transmission rates and compare it with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the providers' tests are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated," says the consumer association for Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable deadline of 14 days to prepare the promised service. This is best done by means of registered enrolment.
If this does not achieve anything even after several requests, customers may terminate and may also claim damages. But if there is a lack of success, only the way to the lawsuit will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has come out in favour of an impeachment survey against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here, is determined by the facts that are being identified," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the deduction of the president - be taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky to investigate intervention by the Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine in a telephone conversation. Because Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have revealed unease about it. Scott's statements are the first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already sought Trump's policy several times, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it became known that Sony and Marvel will go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far Home Home". Several US media reports on this. The film is therefore to be announced: In the USA, the film is to be released from 16. July 2021 starting.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am delighted that Spidey's path in the MCU is being continued. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue to work on ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does the sudden good news come about? It is said that Sony Marvel is said to have made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney company, which also includes Marvel, would involve 30 percent of Spider-Man films in revenue. However, the message is not confirmed.
How Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode there were many happy ends and just as many cameo appearances. And the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who took part in the series for many years, was also paid tribute in a charming way. Attention, the following sections included spoilers to the series finale.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last goodbye greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some reviews once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how they welcomes him after his served prison sentence.
But also her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned casually in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is heading straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a meaningful remark regarding its suit. Whether he has actually overthrewed a frock, the Blessed Harvey wants to know from the groom, only to then say snappily: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four more children drowning in boat accidents
When capsizing a refugee boat in the Aegean, one baby and four other children drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he wants to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about what it says about the refugee situation," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help them cope with it.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed Seehofer's planned tour with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister of the Interior, Christophe Castaner, on Friday.
In Greece, unusually many migrants continue to arrive in Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, according to the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is Turkey still functioning?
The increased figures ultimately raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian deported.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only making difficult progress on the Greek side due to a shortage of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, nearly 29 400 people are waiting for Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The situation on Lesbos is worst: there are currently 5,200 grates are currently located in a warehouse with capacity for 650 people.
Never have there been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, reported the state broadcast.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate changes are "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the healthcare system over the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society of Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and large temperature leaps cause within a short time and increasingly led to heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, elderly and diabetics in particular are affected.
Green politician has to answer for embarrassing photopants
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, was manipulated for this reason being manipulated?
The Canadian Green Party shall hold a reusable cup in his hand in a photo. But now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has long remained unnoticed - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held the reusable coffee mug with metal straw. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had already been published before and was also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a sneezing (cardboard) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green head has to answer for photo flat
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection". And this in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which Trudeau is also increasingly difficult because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and started the discussion about fake news. A user shares a juxtaposition of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable cup."
May was shocked and asserted on her blog that he had known nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, talking to citizens, a cup in her hand. However, he put it right, it was made of bamboo. She always has him with her. A party spokeswoman said it was only a matter of placing the party logo in the picture, not covering up anything. From the photo, only one section can be seen on the website.
May writes that it does her suffering for the employee who has done so. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time they asked for something of their over-engusted team: "If they feel like working a picture again, couldn't they do something with my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens also advised about their use of disposable plastic or for air travel in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photographed. So Katharina Schulze, head of the Bavarian Greens, ate ice cream on holiday with plastic spoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerine wants Free upgrade: Lifelong no fly at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng has been guaranteed an upgrade by contacting Cathay Pacific by mail. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of this. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follow more than 65,000 users. On 30. May it is from Taiwan to New York and on 7. June flown back.
On the outbound flight, staff refused Jaqueline to upgrade, even though she had shown an email in which her Cathay Pacific reportedly held an upgrade. The influencer wants to have received the letter from an airline marketing employee. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having falsified the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman is said to have presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were sceptical: they are hooking at the headquarters. And indeed, the employee from whom the mail allegedly comes has denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This was also confirmed by the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
Airline staff at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and signed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. She had to buy a new flying trip to Taiwan for 1,400 US dollars (around 1,280 euros).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests. Because Cathay had reimbursed her for the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that they do not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices yield according to report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday noon within a very short time. Most recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety was 9.63 US dollars - around 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The slide triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of global oil production to a standstill in mid-September. The Houthi rebels allied with Iran in Yemen's civil war country had claimed the attacks. Like the US government, Saudi Arabia is blaming Iran. A ceasefire would defuse the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, one can concentrate on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy department at Saxo Bank at Bloomberg news agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward motion of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to nearly 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Most recently, Bloomberg reported, citing insiders, that repair work on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than thought after the attack in mid-September. According to this, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and return towards the original quantity.
Most recently, there were several press releases, citing insiders, who report on the rapid progress of the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco during the repair work. However, commodity experts point out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wanting to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some easing in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran were arrested and the recent release on the way to leave the port. The crew now provides the departure forward, while the ship was still anchored, shipping company chief Erik HÃ3nell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the US announced that it would move defensive missiles and soldiers to the Iranian arch-enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and Great Britain had temporarily driven up oil prices significantly in recent weeks.
Charges against Trump are getting worse
In the affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations have been covered up against the White House. Several leading government officials have tried hard to prevent access to the text of the talk at the end of July after a disputed telephone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "cover-up." Trump spoke of a "witch hunt."
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has argued that there will soon be a third summit of leaders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable due to a lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the agency KCNA.
The US has done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the adviser to the North Korean State Department. He also criticized US sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the US and South Korea. But he hopes for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump, so that there will be a rapprochement again.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit meeting should bring with Kim before he agreed to it. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program have stalled since the failed second summit in Hanoi in February, and stalled in Hanoi. In June, they met in the Entmilitarized Zone between the two Korean States. They agreed to revive the consultations, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
Closed with a blue splinter protective vest, the British prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. He established the ignition circle near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico. At a safe distance, the explosive device exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called for current TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but they have not helped to help clean up their way."
Pound under pressure - Interest rate cut expected
British Pound Under Pressure
In view of an early rate cut, the pound is losing worth compared to the euro.
Frankfurt Speculation on an early cut in interest rates by the Bank of England (BoE) is setting the pound sterling. The British currency was cheaper on Friday by up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269.
The sales triggered evidence by central bank Michael Saunders. This brought into talks a cut in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, because the uncertainty will affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders is considered to be an advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the ActivTrades brokerage.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the Brexit hhopping hack's burdens without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to grant his country if necessary without a divorce agreement on the 31st year. October lead out of the EU.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay off for him, writes Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Federation.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details of the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and only to a close trend. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were fake.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sport. Then the Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not entirely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee had around 270 athletes from the country under neutral flag after individual testing at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, and 168 Russian athletes were at the start of the Winter Games in February 2018. They were also allowed to be present at the World Cups in various sports, in the summer the football World Cup with the host took place as participants in Russia.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, the Wada repealed the Rusada banner, but urged access to the laboratory and the samples. The data should shed light on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Federation (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analytical laboratory have been manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have noticed numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower, and the one it received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the IAAF's attitude: The athletics association is the only organization to record Russia's spell. 30 Russian athletes will be competing at the World Cup in Doha. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada had already put riots in place and called on Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening to re-lock the Rusada, and at worst, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
