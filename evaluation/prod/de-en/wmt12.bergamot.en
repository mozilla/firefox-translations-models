No liberating amendment to Tymoshenko by the Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to file a request to abolish the paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned as part of an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the former Prime Minister who could have been granted to the office of the detained Prime Minister, rejected the second reading of the application for the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding a allegedly adverse contract with Russia to purchasing natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the convicted persons is to be tried in court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge of the regime, and the trial also in the West gave rise to the suspicion of the bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been required to accept it.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar el-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners remain to be defined.
As is customary this region, in the elections Islamists, the question is only what - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary law of Sharia, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a land without crime, because theft is cut off the hand for theft.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible apostates of faith be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society of mutually feuding tribes will be united by the Koran in future.
In short, there will be an order in Libya which would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, it is hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the mentioned Libyans.
Seen in this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
Their apology may well only serve the fact that the air strikes of NATO were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We participated only in one shot, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to look at a military occupation of Libya.
This gives rise to a concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But do the oil companies also get the black gold at a ridiculous price without occupation?
Hardly and so the West can finally boast of its selflessness in terms of protecting human rights.
If this does not spoil the Sharia representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe are in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm low was severe through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France are increasing.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than was originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original figures spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and according to Czech. The Statistical Office was thus confirmed by the trend towards slowing down economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally calculated, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds climbed the value of 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes are voiced that the ECB should become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
She won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper and a magnificent goal of Petr Jirásek.
With a large amount of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection won 1-0 thanks to the closing weakness of the home team, a brilliant 'ech's and the hero of the day Jirásek in Montenegro, thus redeeming their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive match of the Czech team, they only put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The pitch birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, which shot two giant opportunities.
Thanks also to an excellent Petr'ech, the Czech selection will be involved at the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that domestic football has a premium of approx. 200 million.
From the first few minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined lengthy and so was mainly played around the center line.
In the second half, too, the pressure from the home team failed and the wide naten downs to the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program in front of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed before the object on Tuesday noon and then announced the death of the USA and Israel.
A few hundred university students in Iran's Isfahan formed a lively sign around the core technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to announce that they are willing to protect their country's core programme, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up its efforts to achieve a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
At noon, students had prayed to the complex before the entrance, and then announced the death to the USA and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, the atomic enrichment plant in Natan's target would also be an attack target, if the attacking attack was to paralycel the Iranian nuclear programme to the intention of an attack.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It does not have breakfast and eats for dinner sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Current surveys proven - obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the milieu in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him is for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are on the table up to half more often on the table than in families living with normal weight children.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had no nightbrocade on the day before the education campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence".
In families with thick people, sports are not one of the favourite activities, which is why the majority of today's students also affected - only 15 percent replied that their parents find their parents once a week for active exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, surveying almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the "Obesity campaign is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever company.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from the project took part in the 4th and 8th participants. Classes part.
Unhealthy food and a lack of movement in the family are decisive factors responsible for the appallingly rising number of children overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, stated that they were eating five times a day, in the Breakfast-second breakfast lunch-van veby night bread mode - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular family breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast on their own.
The worst thing was not the fact that every tenth family does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered to be the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test showed that unhealthy fries are consumed much more often in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed are doing sports, only less than half of their parents do - only 15 percent.
Put your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own menu based on appetite and opinion from offered opportunities.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favourite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alease is above all the great popularity of sweet sodas," is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta preceded poultry.
Legumes almost did not like the children at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very small.
Cryption to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completion of the enlightening lecture "Objectia is not a coincidence", the results of the project stated in the results of the project.
This was suitable, for example, with the sweet limes, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish as the main dish of the day in the questionnaire and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit objected that this was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
I didn't know what comes in the least.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how this is going "on the square".
It is supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we were debating with director Alena (no one of the course participates) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideal proportioned figure.
And these are most of us.
Some have one too short neck, the other a boyish figure without neat curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal broad shoulders, extend the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big breasts, wider hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging without she looking too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should at least be tailored to a piece of measure.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, you feel much better than in a post side that always slips up and down, sticking to the waist, etc.
Boy-like figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bulging, applications, embroidery or gathering.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do in view of the applied homework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity, for whom she should come up with appropriate outfits - daytimewear and evening strobe.
In doing so we have to consider the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I am supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I juble, because for me personally this is much better than attracting Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased in a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphical page of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to a concrete specification, such as trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamenk told us about this.
But that only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview overview.
The Saturday presentation, filled with information about figure types, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan PokornÃ3, from the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben RenÃ .
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a sent stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collars and the whole look is completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But the most citae came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then may you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we have to throw all these tenets, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see something else in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist needs to have prepared many more variants of clothing than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes in the photo, in combination with other accessories, sometimes look very different from what is actually.
So you have to expect all this when designing the outfit.
Jan PokornÃ3 confirmed that the image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something I look like is secondary).
And if someone of us can already be styled, then we should expect that he or she is most likely to force a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google afterwards to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has closed or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario told us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only focuses on fashion and then needs to "join" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles and he has to be a clever psychologist.
People assess without currying favour and standing in with their opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sift her wardrobe and add pretty pieces, then we can't clear up the whole closet and tell her - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things that you recommend what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "court bag" has to include.
So such a bag that you knit up at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary propriates with you.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, displacement for hair removal or safety pins, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist helps to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are gathered at the back, if it is too large (pins or other clamps are prohibited, so that the fabric does not break) and of course seater.
However, we not only have to listen, but also practically try out something, we learned how to stick shoes correctly.
Even when taking pictures in the studio where the floor is also, it is possible to spoil the sole of a shoe, let alone the outside.
We glued and glued to us...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so that they are not damaged.
So you really have to be skillful.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without any restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we were heard at the second weekend selection course.
One thing has become clear to me by now - dedicating one thing to the styling on a professional level is not child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, amateurish mistakes for the routine ride to the early shift.
It was possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, but what good is what this is already if obviously nobody wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part aroused high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He said that the already year-old game series "Need for Speed" was shifting a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to at NFS, there is a lot different in the end of what you had expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series for a few years.
So it is no longer a mistake, but rather signs of an inconceivable laziness of the game developers in the principle.
The adventure starts very well.
First of all, one is introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit down at the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different course and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
You don't get the impression that play is always offering the same thing.
Some environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing about things about the world.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up by deeply snowy landscape seems very pleasant.
Every now and then the atypical elements bring a little variety into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be in hellish care that you are not buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well in a row.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then one expects a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police, who want to screw up the whole thing, are also involved.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than one would expect (certainly only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the matter, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is one of the elements said above in the context that make the game more varied.
The driving model is progressing in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that today's point of view, it does not pull out trees, on the other hand, you could not say it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But action-packed racing, the local driving model continues to do quite well, although you could find better competitors.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
Real problems only arise after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
From a game of this kind it is hard to be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea how the car behaves before any impact on any object, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When closely overtaking or driving by incoming cars, you only "strip" the other cars easily in some places, but in others, almost identical situations you come to skidding and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the cartridge drives to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter, from however it is annoying.
The remains are solved in this way: if you have total loss or land far away from the track, then the game throws you back to the last indication of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five remaining misses.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from scratch.
The restarts are therefore more of a means of being a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should not leave on it.
However, sometimes the restart does not even help, so nothing helps than to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to be driven through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, at the appropriate place you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come as the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes two accommodating cars in front of an equally coming, but until you arrive there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you arrive there, because everything is designed to keep this situation always close to your nose.
The counterparts have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
On the most crazy thing, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge that one passes in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously overtake one here come out on devil.
And when he is in front of you, then of course he takes the view, so that you drive your own car there a few times in a lump.
Sure - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of playing.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining overall and in places so action-loaded that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle, there is no matter what "to blame" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
Another unusual idea is the change of car during the races.
You can't miss the petrol stations on the route, because this is where you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
The task mode (challenges) goes hand in hand with the mode of the game history - i.e. the races in the individual locations that are known from the history.
There are not only medals, but also to gain experience for one's own profile, which is together for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
To reach the higher driver level, various items need to be dismantled: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online feature Autolog, which compares, among other things, with those of other players achieved, and also provides further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get your car into a subway tunnel (in what to me), where you race for a long time on the rails in the dark (in what you meet).
On the speedometer, numbers look between 150 a 200 km/h (domen), but suddenly comes from behind a subway and drives you to scrap.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors consider us to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that the refresh rate slows down on some exciting moments and this sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents involving greater numbers of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to address a scale of as a broad as possible scale, a soundtrack a lá "something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?
The general evaluation of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have said with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to stick these mistakes in the eye with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has tangibly balanced the balance among the individual institutions."
I did not expect such a hard war to burn down."
"It will take five or six years before the waves have smoothed and all become accustomed to their new role," said Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, sharply her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "Understanding and open about Europe" already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and its mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied some lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism was made that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who did not cope with such a role, but I must say that it took everyone's breath away from how well he has taken up the matter.
"He is a person who manages to patiently listen to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", in other words, as an important step towards reaching agreement and improving the readability of EU policy towards states, such as: China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us our oil hats Quargel
Ms Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lives and intended to live in the near future.
She described the Czech presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
It described the case of the government during the presidency as a major negative that had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador, it was quite hectic not only at the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will become a lean and economical budget, which sectors of the economy are given priority, which countries are more and which are being promoted less, all of which are now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandingly over Europe".
"If I don't like something, it's grey abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
As a citizen, how can I actually know whether they are really thinking about crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone actually wants to ban us the quark.
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in promise
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more negative ones, than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech party.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also elevated the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called. V4.
"Do you think that if a Pole or Hungary comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the Frenchman says next to me: "Hey, what is your heads together - is that again your V4?" and thereby makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU will expect, above all, tough rules for the budgetary policy of the member states in the future.
As a much more real thing, as a "European federation" it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries away from the Eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of encouraged cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only those countries who want it and those who do not want to be quietly off the sidelines should be said to be standing together."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong "Europe of different speeds", awaits Ms. Vicenová.
In this respect, she also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues must be discussed with impact on the entire EU by all member states, and not just by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since it was founded.
The basis for this longevity already laid its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems were easy to solve if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the life of the future giant to take place (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it has remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope to do more over the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's director to mark the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson had already done social care for his employees in the thirties - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid holidays as one of the first American employees, an insurance company by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newcomers and traders.
The long-term relationships between IBM and its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was ingenious in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM picked up any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that Palmisan at the helm of IBM will be alternated by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometty.
This has been involved with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of sales, marketing and strategy head.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstorming, which are many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, after all, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
"From the very beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," economist told Professor Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems with the help of technologies," added George Colony from consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference not to be present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo because of family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
IBM owns the most patents of all American technology companies and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the diskette.
With approx. 220 billion dollars in market value (market capitalization) was IBM's second largest technology company this year (just after Apple), although it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Ahead of view
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, trying with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not be emotionally committed to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they do not work, leaving them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, who basically stands and falls with his operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
The largest number of services, software and hardware participate in IBM's profits, each participating in one fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still represented most strongly with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth 15 billion dollars, but in the same period it invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continued after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept over the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithfully, who increased its scope of investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM has survived the current crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has risen by 120 percent since 2008 and the company's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM company slogan is: everything can be changed - but the values are not.
This is another reason why it is expected that this flexible giant will master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflights
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded a hundred years ago in New York, initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not take over the name IBM until 1924 - it was originally a matter of a trademark name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, their history until the 1980s. dates back.
They had technologies such as the famous ticket watches to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as the chairmanship of the supervisory board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who headed the competing company Thomas J. Watson stopped to help him with the management of the company.
This leader then even outsshined the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still based on the company's invincible culture and identity today.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began to produce and distribute all possible machines for retail - from sausage and cheese tailoring, to cash registers.
In the first four decades in which Watson managed the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat in the executive chair forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped NASA's IBM to lead flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM is paying off over the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a wise manner in uneven planned areas, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and city administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which is intended to help traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where there is also a top world-class research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtáová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtácová (53) says - now is over!
After her spouse Josef RychtáÃ1⁄2 (53) of the protector of Iveta Barto ová (45) became their lover, Darina still remained hope that Josef will awaken and come home from his pink dream.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life it has set itself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtá ová.
As Darina Rychtáová by the singer I. Bartosová had offered refuge in her own house if she had not even dreamed of what she wants to do with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to Cany after 30 days, Joseph immediately joined her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loves them.
Over time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
RychytáÃ3 doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If RychtáÃ3 Iveta Barto ová were to leave in the future, then he will certainly not be welcomed open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our home together, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain ties," told Mrs. Rychtácová; however, she also said that she has already separated herself emotionally from him and is alone in mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to Darina has so far wheeled Joseph wears with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a marriage of paper and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping."
"I talk to Darina quite normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. RychtáÃ3 (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to seek a new love, then he does not want to prevent it from doing so.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take on all responsibility.
The worst female vices: what about you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female vices, they will shake some of them out of their sleeve without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we recall a few bad habits, which let the men blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does your spouse suggest to be addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one rager weekly?
Do you like shopping and may it be a little more at promotions?
Then in your case it is really a question of weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire halfway under control.
But hand on his heart, which woman keeps it out to stroll through a clothing shop in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not trying out everyone (in all kinds of color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how often they have told her husband - sometimes you'd rather stay outside...
Constant discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start to jog or do gymnastics?"
"Am I attacking you at all?"
Does that somehow familiarize them?
Yes?
Then you probably also belong to the women who are literally obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger gender is united - with the increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming increasingly incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and do so at least twice a week.
Swear with your partner, because he once again hurls onto the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you swarm the children, because the just flushed washbasin is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, when polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviant", you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness are not in the first place in family life.
This excessive purity sky can ultimately also harm mutual relations and, above all, to the peace of the family.
Stingles
"Dirty gym pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet towel doesn't just throw on the floor."
If your partner is subjected to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm tree.
Of course, this is not badly meant, they only want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not have needed so much to complain.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and bark, they snuggle up or even slander behind the back or make alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to shake out such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on heart - that is peculiar to all women.
However, this is not to be confused with gossipers of preven caliber, who are not sacred and are sacred to anyone who probably despise everyone in their environment and which represent a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráek helped Philadelphia to win their assistants
The hockey foretop JaromÃ3r Jágr had a large share in the Philadelphia ice bull’s 5-3 win on the ice in Carolina at the NHL’s Monday match with two assistants, and is once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was Claude Giroux in both cases, who added an assistance and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also included Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráek.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had prophesied a great evening to Giroux.
"Already before the game, I tell him that he succeeds in having a hat trick today."
I had that in the feeling of it."
"Now and again, such a feeling comes over," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Before the gate of the Hurricanes fought for the puck and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, then directed Wayne Simmonds' shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he is certainly one of the best three," Jágr paid tribute to his center.
"I didn't think I would have happened in my life that I'm playing with such an hockey player at the end of my career, as with him."
"I am very happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
“All the years in the NHL, my fellow players set up their game on me and now the spit turns,” smiled Jágr.
Carolina made games a drama - through the hit of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty, a goal was approached.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Pronger acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took momentum and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia moved to the lead of the eastern conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Paek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and lost in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their, the candiadescs also lost Beck their leadership in the penalty shooting 2:3.
He could not turn one of the penalties.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home team, probably the high illness-related failure on the defensive - the game they played with only five defenders to an end.
"That's bad."
"The encounter was playing with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do, we have to deal with that," said Jacques Martin.
"With each change one wave of attacks after another and we didn't have anything to counter it."
"We would have made the game easier and released the puck from our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondcej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, who thus ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five state travel agencies granted in the former SSR: Ã...edok, sports director, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies merely sold travel to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, and at that time they were only allowed to go to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to Lake Balaton.
One light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
It was a great paradox of those socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (also the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then you had to accept huge lines or even stay overnight in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter had not gone.
The so-called. Foreign currency commitment - the condition for leaving the West - was only given "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign currency.
The weathersomes therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and Datschen - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday destination in the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the obligation to currency to the neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna, Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks simply could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for a place to stay in the hotel or in a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech travel abroad was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living, and the average salary, increased, which ended in 1997 to another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for trips, travel agencies began to prepare regular trips after 1997 by means of ferry flights, making air travel incredibly discounted compared to the past thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, had already non-visa payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-amten" travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to far away sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the epoch that characterized our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On the 17th In November 2008, the USA abolished the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely ranked our country among the world's highly developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time, and for the first time in their history, they gave more than 15 thousands for a single holiday stay including the costs at the holiday destination. CZK per head.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate is threatened.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman and threatens that the successor to Ivan Haek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no agreement on the election regulations under which election regulations are to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested people want to manage Czech football - JindÃ3ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and TomáÃ3 PaclÃ3k.
In June, he resigned from his role, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Haek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two chambers of the Union, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly shown on the 16th century. September, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the People's House in the Prague district of SmÃ3chov for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
You could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or the functionaries equipped with a power of attorney.
In this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, which was also attached to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which, in the opinion, is not permissible on a power-based basis.
However, the disputes over the electoral regulations continue to continue.
The Executive Committee, too, no longer showed any clarity on the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to do in the 3rd Go round to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model must be found," said Du'an Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairpersons of FA-R, who represents professional football in the management.
According to the standard model, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber wins in the third round for which he is running.
Moravia is supposedly willing to respond to the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least one two-thirds majority in this percentage count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would call the entire bicameral concept into question," says Svoboda understood the objections of the Moravian side, which would best find it not to bend the electoral regulations, but to vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, TomáÃ3 PaclÃ3k also agrees, even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral regulation is probably most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the statutes are chosen."
"This means that no nonsensical substitute variants are made up, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria PlzeÃ3, who was a candidate for the first time and, in his statements, distinguished himself above all from Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"When football first rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the regulations for their own purposes."
"This is why a renewed blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense will eventually win," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations should supposedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football general will be complete until the qualifying match.
The charter plane, which was supposed to fly to Podgorice, Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl, was unable to start in Prague in the morning because of a technical fault, and so they searched feverishly for a replacement variant, how to bring part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage round game.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to come to on Wednesday, is probably decisive.
Josef DobeÃ3, the Minister for Education, Youth and PhysiEducation, would have liked to reach an agreement between the divided parties within the country's largest sports association.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the eligibility of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the STV, which is to point the new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes into the fight for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If TomáÃ3 PaclÃ3k, the head of the Pilsner footballers, could have identified a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR), he would not have committed himself to the fight for this leading position.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said PaclÃ3k Ã...TK.
The main reason for Paclik to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and JindÃ3ich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the head of FA-R.
Paclik also stresses that in the event of his victory, he only intends to exercise the function of the Chairman for one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too attached to the football activity.
"I have spoken personally with some people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some said they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of everything, PaclÃ3k allegedly disturbs Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence voting votes at general meetings.
It is therefore unacceptable for Paclik that Pelta holds the position of Chairman.
"When it was victorious, today's condition would be preserved and in Czech football it would not be preceded at all."
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, would get football twice as bad," said PaclÃ3k.
He also alludes to Pelta's name some time ago in connection with telephone hijackings to investigate a corruption affair, but Pelta emerged without impunity.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta the (cha.) Soccer should be included."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Ã...ekl PaclÃ3k, who says his earlier saying, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more relaxed.
However, if PaclÃ3k wins in the Thursday election, he could certainly imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclik had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, thinks, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities".
"I could well imagine him, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he is able to run the association as a manager."
"I am not in matters of which I do not understand," said PaclÃ3k, who caused a sensation in September that he was in the lead behind the recall of the referee commission with LuÃ3k Macela, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclik himself claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And refers to his abilities in the management of private companies, since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, who celebrated his first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of it."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appointment commissions, which degenerates into recurring situations," said Paclik, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta leader Daniel KÃ3etÃ3nskÃ1⁄2.
As one of his priorities, he would see the consolidation of relations between the FA-R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby for more money from the lottery tax to go into sport with the political leaders.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to".
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they must also say clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not regard his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA-R must be "partisan".
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to apparently transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," PaclÃ3k clarified.
Pelta promised new statutes of FA-R, which will shut down a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he will campaign for the FAR to receive new statutes, which will exclude disputes over the electoral regulations in the future from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September that he wanted to focus on the national team and the winning of funds if he had election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, and so the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about leading football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is run by someone, says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and the Executive Committee.
That is another reason why he thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Haek.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June that were not as perfect as all had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September onwards," said Pelta.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the citizens' association that he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I become a chairman, I accept it personally and be willing to take responsibility personally if it doesn't work."
"This is a thing of principle without which he cannot be," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindzich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his opposing candidate was his first deputy.
He has also not attacked TomáÃ3 PaclÃ3k for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for more than a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, many are now doubting his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains faithful to his proclaims, which he said already in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions to the national team.
And this should be the figurehead of Czech football.
"I would also try to stop all affairs - from the Bohemians Causa, to the reverberations of the corruption scandal last year."
"After that, I would rush to negotiate with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funds for all football," said for forty-six year old candidate, two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the head of Czech football would not mean any clean-ups.
"Once I would have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervousness prevails.
Despite the time-consuming catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If really the only content point should be how to choose in the third round, then we get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only regains it if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FA-R starts to work hard under him
If the previous Deputy Chairman Jindcich Rajchl was to be elected as the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this allegedly would deprive many people in the association of their mood.
Rajchl promises that if you choose, you will start to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous presiding President Ivan Haek has begun.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national selection, professional football, to performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in the conversation for Ã...TK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes themselves to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in each segment progresses with miles."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard himself," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not running at all.
"I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't constantly throw me clubs between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I could not give up because otherwise would be allowed to do so."
"This is trust that you can't squander," he said.
He is said to be allowed to continue the work he started under Haek.
"In two years we have done a big piece of work and I don't just want to throw that away."
"Processes were started that may not be shown in a few years and I would like to see someone stopping them," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Haiti.
"I believe in systematic approach and that is something Mirek Pelta doesn't help."
"Behind him there are mainly people who would make football so that he was only there for the chosen one."
I can be accused of doing a lot, but not that I am biased."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then rose to the first division."
"Then it couldn't happen that only three Moravian clubs play in the league today, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club TomáÃ3 PaclÃ3k has now joined the fight for the function of the chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly to blame for the fact that the association is not pulling in the same direction.
While he told Pelta that "it is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football gain new trust," he holds the second rival - PaclÃ3k for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"Nobody can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, then he would continue the things that Ivan Haek has initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
He would certainly not want to bend things in his favor," Rajchl says, judging his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Tarting pool in Ufo-Optik, state pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and rest the tired legs in bubble baths after a city tour or a hike.
A book shows where wellness in the water is at its best.
When Iris Meder went on a research journey over the past one and a half years, one could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in ornately designed domes, sponge marble cottages waiting for them at the edge of the pool, and was amazed at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she quickly picked it up in her notebook - including knowing details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her newly published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore Concrete Buildings" in the Taunus.
It has led its "journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing beauty enthusiast.
With sports, she doesn't have much to do with what does it matter, Meder says - it's just in the water.
It's annoying that swimming fans have to accept blue tiles and chlorine gestures, while joggers can inhale the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park.
"One day, I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says the meders who live in Vienna.
"So I started gathering beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Ploughing in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have done an effort, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eye: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colourful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to take a leap into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing body in a rustic karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the entire city in mind from Zurich's rooftop baths, you can look at the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton looking at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam room there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From three shells open to the top, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder of the smell of chlorine got into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Ã...rpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it is so strongly smelled of heating oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you let yourself be glideed into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed off terrain.
The bath was closed in 1902 by the architect Dusan Jurkovic.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeding between the tiles.
However, there has been a counteract of the decay in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already occurred to three stages of construction; not only can you discover neo-Roman elements from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is already a job to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is obviously only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank illuminates commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank spend its business with agricultural commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
The CEO then wants to draw conclusions in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the matter is clear: according to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up their prices - and that the banks are therefore carrying a complicity in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar way.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said that no business was "worthy to jeopardise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - including the recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank wants to tell the peak that it is taking to tell the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkering at his image
Foodwatch head Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time affirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthless banks are harming the general welfare today."
As the supreme bank lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly obliged.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter if Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not be transferred to the Supervisory Board, other than planned.
By moving away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could supplement his image.
And he hardly needs to suffer any possible losses - his successor would eventually have to do with it.
One in two would cancel commodity plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November November 1001 people surveyed.
As a result, it considers just eleven percent to be legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which prices for food are used.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: according to the survey, every second would quit all investments where money goes to commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about noting their account and switching to another institute.
21er House in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion from Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and deteriorated.
Now it will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern post-war architecture is raved about clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an appropriate and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion was given the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built Austria's pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bowl-like supporting building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition construction, had been set up after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden near Vienna's Südbahnhof, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th town had been built. century opened - the "20er house" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially and technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, he is now called the "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, has penetrated the new beginning in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art history with a respectable career in the youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly implemented the conversion of politicians and memorial advocates, she purchased public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop were to be provided, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had been sensitively converting and expanding Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was a "horrously important place" for him, where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "a throwing energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass-fibre reinforced insulating glass were inserted and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basement levels brought space for the new use, a lowered ditch between the house and the street provides the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red-brown anti-rust colour.
And the cinema is even exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban stroke of luck has occurred: The completely newly planned "main station soccer district" is being built around the Swiss garden, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck will perhaps come: The 21er Haus could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as one hears, it is already negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Bahn plans winter-crisis package in millions
The railway has invented a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
This costs millions.
According to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros in the fight against winter-related train shunts and delays.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing a group-internal crisis plan, and investments totalling around 300 million euros have been planned by 2015.
This is intended to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow disposal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the operational courses.
Two months ago, Bahn boss Rüdiger Grube had warned about train cuts and delays this winter after a leading meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been making a problem for years that it has to have had ICE trains checked significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalty in the US
After the turmoil surrounding boss Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a losing million there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also setting up its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (€106 million) in a comparison, to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole range of large banks of having caused cooperative banks to purchase financial products with false promises; they had downplayed the risks.
Such securities lost value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks into depth.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not blame the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA chair Debbie Matz welcomed the accommodation of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US Cooperative Banks and steps in with Pleiten to protect client deposits.
The NCUA tries to reimburse the billionaire damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also picked up other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs, in the summer.
The mortgages in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
This is based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was a large number of financial firms.
At the height of the financial crisis in September 2008, the US investment bank tipped Lehman Brothers over.
Even if the events have been a few years ago, the banks are currently facing a sharp breeze in the USA.
Investors and regulators have brought countless complaints to obtain compensation or punish misdeeds.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint.
It accuses 18 major international banks of taking advantage of two US-state fund financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions worth around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a complaint with the FHFA, where it concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt residents stand for "substantial losses", but without specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and declared that he wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett picks up at IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that they would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could be poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion about investments in the industry.
He had had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and creates computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett now revealed on the US economic channel CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of IBM's largest shareholders, with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM has known about the engagement so far.
He praised the management, which had caused proper profits even during the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as data center operations for some time.
The more than 100 year old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed a cargo railway, for example, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
In addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, its Berkshire Hathaway holding company also has shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The age of 81-year-olds took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After becoming known of the Buffett investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the market.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, is worth a total of more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, together with Apple and Microsoft.
But he did not want to get in at Microsoft, said Buffett.
The founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the "Zwickauer cell" the "Zwickauer cell" doubts Turkish media at the German constitutional state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now hanging up again.
The murders of eight Turkish origins and a Greek small business company in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is responding to in Turkey and within the German population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, a long-diantly believed spectre returns: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals proportions whose dimension is still far from being foreseeable.
"Does bloody ideology come up again?" headlined the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasises that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities may also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted closer: it recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated a ceremony for the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, the coexistence had been staged as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which references the background to the series of murders.
The edition of Germany of the "Hürriyet" does not allow itself to be taken to pull this intellectual connection.
"It's beginning to stink," says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stresses that people were murdered, taxes paid and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The actions of the police and their later search success is discussed in the German-Turkish Internet Forums extremely critically.
The authors are surprised why the German authorities did not seem to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared to drastic means: "If we continue to sloppy here, the migrants have no choice but to self-defense and armament."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the goodness of the Enlightenment and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger illustrated by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the Brandruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the feeling of us on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticized at the time: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack of Solingen, he sent a condolence to the Turkish president, but had his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel represented at the funeral service in Cologne - Kinkel listed in his speech at the time, how many taxes the local Turks were making.
Quite as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turkish people has been in the local rule of law ever since.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive education and reassessment of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost bankrupted during the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it is supposed to be a German.
Axel Weber certainly did not think so.
After his spectacular departure from the Bundesbank's helm, it was announced in July that he would compete in 2013 an almost equally spectacular new job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of Deutsche Schweizer UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praising Switzerland because of its beauty and UBS because of its newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has achieved the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be very different.
A UBS trader in London had circumvented all the security systems of the bank and shattered around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only praised in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered to be ailing since then - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he already took over the chairmanship of the board in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes hard.
He is not a banker, rather economics professor and central banker, and would certainly have necessary an induction period.
With one blow, he then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proven that it has long earned the title of "largest scandal bank in Europe".
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand, it has been swirling from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will remain spared the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the concealed and solid, but also self-suspected Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
UBS, for example, administered more potential for clients in 2007 with 1.6 trillion dollars than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had advanced into the league of the world's largest banks as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger explains: "I always presented UBS to a good bank for my students at the time."
"From today's perspective, you ask yourself: How could I be wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was due to a wrong line at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly retreated, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they guessed why he had left.
The bank's investment division had shrugged itself with subprime paper and had to write billions.
To shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of a whopping 13 billion Swiss francs.
But she actually found investors, but some whom, about which some would have been stricken until shortly before: an intransparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so concealed that one did not even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still the second best paid Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was facing collapse in view of its bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be bailed out by the state.
The SNB purchased UBS for tens of billions of problem securities, the Swiss Confederation spent six billion Swiss francs on a forced convertible bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
After all, UBS's total assets in 2007 were more than five times the size of Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"Once we could not save UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The second one was followed by the first disaster.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated to the tax dispute with America and agreed to surrender the data of wealthy clients, who may have evaporated taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified gains from these transactions, including a premium.
This more or less openly acknowledged UBS who has helped tax evasion.
At the same time, it lost something that had always been its capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to the false speculation and in asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it became a little quieter again, just as one thought that now UBS would get it back, follows this unfortunate trader story: A single trader gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it does become apparent that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Chief Financial Officer of a major German bank is also convinced: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - the world may also collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main train station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are sumptuous, the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been residing here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks such as Julius Baer.
The reception hall of UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of it are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
Both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have this idea of Swiss banks, however, eventually displaced - or revealed how the head of a small Swiss private bank is found.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
UBS has become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, earned its first gains and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank.
On the 15th The disaster became visible in October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small seven million country decided to use the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash."
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs or around 45 billion euros to save the major bank standing in bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined forces to form a huge company.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
The fact that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented itself helped to translate: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came favorably at a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who worked his way up from the banking apprenticeship to the top."
But Ospel had relied on tricky at the end.
And in the end, Wuffli had probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: arrogance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly spoke the same slogan: Goldman Sachs stumbles away.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
Then UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some steps had already been done to her.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, it played at the top.
However, management consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge gap with the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost them existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded in front of it invested in American subprime investments.
It became a huge machine that packaged and reached securities on American mortgage loans - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for the exit.
"Still in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it there," says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up more difficult than you wanted to see.
UBS has become an ejection seat and is still shaky.
Anyone who leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (yet) quite that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly separated itself from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established itself: He is to lead the business of UBS permanently, informed the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to sail back to the state of the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
He strikes 3500 places.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already facing.
So far, he has only said publicly that he will first look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock exchanges
The looming recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without clout.
The throttled industrial production on the continent stifled the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief about the change of government in Rome and Athens was unable to prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems crowded to the fore again, said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial assets were on the sales labels.
The Dow Jones index of the default values listed 0.6 percent at the close of trading at a decrease of 12.078 points.
In the course of trading, the market barometer oscillated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a decline of 1.2 percent with 5985 meters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is responding to the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat statistics office.
This was sceptical about the US investors: "We are not an island but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
From his point of view, it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett overturned a decades-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional company and initially had it down almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
At 2.6 percent, Bank of America share certificates were significantly more strongly than the market.
The house silver up almost the entire remainder of its shares in the China Construction Bank, removing 6.6 billion dollars.
With the net profit from the business, the institute wants to upgrade its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory specifications.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing suffered and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock won 1.5 percent after the company had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and estimated the value of the order at 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 additional machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
Approximately 710 million shares were switched to the owners on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 values increased, in 2281 fell after and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, 630 were in the increase, in 1913 in the red and 82 respectively, with sales of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, roaten crows are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like it, the others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities local habitual complaints about dirt and noise of the animals are taking over.
A remedy against the "problem birds" has not yet been in sight.
Newets could no longer be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in Leer, East Frisian.
There, experts from all over Germany consulted on possible ways out.
Find alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of particularly protected roaten crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing buildings and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs, among other things, in Soest in Westphalia, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project to kill crow in the county had caused negative cords to be killed in the municipality.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and beating with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the rainy, does not help," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer has noticed.
Squirting nests with water or cutting trees, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals leave, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Aburiment is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities could not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of sergeantness of the animals from sensitive living areas and offers to resettle them in other places is conceivable.
"Info boards instead of chainsaws" promoted the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different approach to the animals: "We can best bear a pimple in the face with himself."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg crow trail in Schleswig-Holstein, informing the signs about the lives of highly intelligent roaten crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had their own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: rooks not only use aids to get to a treat, but even make their tools themselves as aids.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested how far the intelligence of the birds is enough at four rooks.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffolding with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they detected what size and shape a stone must have to have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the smart crows had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertically mounted cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them down wire pieces.
All four animals formed a hook from this, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four rooks even succeeded right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup were left.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are present at the European Championship 2012.

The former wolf burger from the English leader Manchester City put a header to the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets Czech Republic
Afterwards, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade metre after an action by Fabio Coentrao, whom Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the vice-European champion of 2004 made everything clear with four goals.
Petr Jiracek finished in the 81st for the Czech Republic. Minute also the last doubts.
This is the fifth time in a row by the European Champion of 1976 to the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionist Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st recent). FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a sightseeing second in the initial phase.
Final male Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th. Minute from the rotation of the penalty area limit just past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the transverse baton had to save the Tschechen for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate shortly before the end made everything clear.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to vacate his place on the bank of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
The Turks almost caught a dream start in front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance gun, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the rebound in the gate.
However, Croatia took more and more control after the moment of shock.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who from the 62. The Bundesliga legion Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action minute for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic square.
Trapattoni drives to the European Championship

Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) was possible for guests.
Ireland has been speeding from the start, but had to reach the 23rd of the day from the beginning. Wait Minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of employees in the country.
The Dax Group announced on Tuesday that around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) will be invested by 2015.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," announced Co-Chef Bill McDermott at a customer trade fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from currently around 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of offices of the world company software leader will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Mass Battle on a Personal Level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror begins in a sensitive and generous way. A story of World War I, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters that goes to one's heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments when you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and deprived of their illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which destines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he does not describe incorrectly as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulances and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, become insane or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some joining while others go out.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Horror" moves with expert glances over other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Bee baskets fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and listen to cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take flight?
Who ever come?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund states, "were foisted with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixing ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailors.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other previously published material.
Their life reports can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely alive in Englund's collection of small moments that loses in detail.
Many of them are about lack and helping.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminium, false eraser, paper dressings, wooden buttons."
He talks more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "Meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and was last served with a false wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were covered with wood."
As he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honour and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to sweat and says about the war: "One feels that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the estate chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and pretending to mean such a facade civilization and as if there was no barbarity behind their own strengthened and skirted shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and that no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you refrain from the thought of sacrificing oneself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who has been hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and new forms of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word-skilled and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailistic suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivic behaviour as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a venereal disease at a prostitute in order to escape the frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal paws, because soldiers bought and smacked themselves on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate stranded him in the eye, which led them to be blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashes uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted, such as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I have ever read about in a non-fiction book.
I do not give it anymore.
But it is as if he had snatched this page with the main characters with his book and lit it with a match.
A meticulously planned attack after an early misstep
Hundreds of police officers were involved, and some of them wore helmets.
They had decided to spend the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. All the others initially believed to be part of an exercise.
Chief of Police Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing occupations in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid laying of a large number of police officers - to focus on lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, what a declaration spoke as an "exercise."
"The few policemen who, to my knowledge, did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials at the area."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On the 14th October officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including operations commandos from around the city - hundreds of mobile officials, who are usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people enter and go out in the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o'clock at night is a good time to go inside.
"It was appropriate to do so if there is the least number of people in the park," he said.
ambulance with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers stood before departing from the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive ready near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials invaded the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left the place.
The police said that no tents would be touched by 1:45 to give protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene if arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this was done to ensure its own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to be stopped from watching the police operations in the park. And they said that the officials' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved towards the west by the big confusion of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved to position near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park.
Some of the barriers erected and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied themselves together in their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them loose.
As Mr. Kelly said, until approx. 3:30 a.m. no arrests performed in the park.
According to the police, the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were caused, as he said, due to "induous behavior and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "conducted" "the operation not," as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were built on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, one block to the south.
It was possible to see how the police from these sites extended the perimeter further and further around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with signs, were driving people outside.
About 28 people were located in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At around 5 o'clock, a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle, and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place the amount threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester were taken to the hospital.
Trade union will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school supervisors who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, because the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last opportunity that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, childcare coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest paid employees in the city and on the 7th edition of the city. October, in a move, which union leaders described as political revenge for the city's last year, refused to give the city access to a health fund that the working groups had maintained, with which the budget gap was to be closed.
This allegation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, last month, the layoffs were part of the budget that were adopted in June.
A member of the city council fired back and explained to him that the budget did not specify that school helpers would be dismissed.
District officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference where the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will be Mr. Chocolates Walcott and the city's Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a city spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice, said that the lawsuit did not hold the lawsuit, so their individual allegations could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit before the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's poor districts to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
It sets out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa school schools, 17 school assistants in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed at the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of psychiatric parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36. Districts were reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each school of poor enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the payroll of a school to a pool of available workers paid for by the central office.
"Sixty-sixty-sustained coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," says the draft lawsuit.
Mission finished, Congress ready to notify Libya
It ultimately looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing about the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee concludes a resolution held by President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is under the authority, with Libya praising for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libya who have begun reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the choice of wording of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in the NATO Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorising the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was dismissed in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law fell through the Senate. The board also overrejected a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
This put the US mission into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was enough upset to criticize Obama's approach within the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20. October killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31. October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-liberation" and "expands the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the Board for Foreign Relations, or will they divide legislators, as has done the June law?
The last version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or other area that is currently being put to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to put their changes to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes submitted to this Congress and cover a whole range of issues.
Some are twice - the same law was submitted to both the Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budgetary change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control national expenditure."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners to the Republicans who want to polish up their CVs - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can present, during the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation to two terms of the president.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to a good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex is a recurring template, as is a change that prohibits the burning of banners.
Some legislators also want to enable federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as members propose changes, they move as much faster as in previous years.
In the 111. Congress presented legislators 77 of such amendments. in 110. Congress 66.
The pace fades away compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly suggested more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment to add is - the 27th - ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Submitted but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at an election event in Tucson at an early distance, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She singed alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover is greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she wrestled according to words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the sphere, which divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and traversed her head from start to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to cast a triumphant vote to brake on debt.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her feeling, Gifford (41 replied, "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, which was recorded shortly before the couple's new book was published: "Gabby: A Story About Courage and Hope."
The special has been pursuing Gifford's recovery since the assassination of 8. January.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bare shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords is in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: You can see how the congressman sings "Girls Just Wanna Fun Have" together with the therapists for Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the assassination attempt.
Her husband said that he was Gifford's on the 12th century. In March, an article in a daily newspaper about the attack had read when it interrupted it and first asked about the six people who had been killed during the assassination attempt.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a Missouri prison and is forcibly treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you were not defeated"?" Kelly said.
You were only hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops are more likely to be compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A look at a keyword was collected around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos got up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which was observed by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops different.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers have meant it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public sphere.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say staff.
The public is increasingly behaving as if people in uniform did her suffering.
"We were not at all victims," said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realised that the anger that returning troops hit the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, discussions on pity in silence and private parties are held between war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian them before people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would ask themselves whether a "backwatering, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and took over an upscale state post in Washington upon his return.
While seeking a job, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the struggle.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to hold the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in war.
Benefits on the battlefield are rarely singled out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely common during the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a member official.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military is facing the growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in rape before the military court.
If it does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Over Stephen Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th. Week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a pack of 12 beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan wrangled aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh what, he is 19.
He is from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they walked on Lyman's room, the man kicked behind her, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, on the 18th, November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are waiting anxiously for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to justice.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but who increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers' colleagues, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or appropriate jurisdiction under the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is following the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically structured," she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in a position to eradicate the culture retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, if necessary, they will file many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team, headed by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to reject lawsuits.
The files of the court, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged with by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court from 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for violations inflicted on active soldiers inflicted on active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.
The Ministry of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in struggle, the distinction lies solely in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting.
It is time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she does not stand alone in her fight: three other complaints are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynist atmosphere.
Independently, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that received rape victims to dismiss them from service - a common procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration, in which they accused their discriminatory practices of dealing with performance claims for people who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently through a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of indications.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuse were reported, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defence.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account approx. 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases occurring per year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases covered in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole host of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was a member of a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before attacking.
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought the labor would start. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came out, I said to my commander: This was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonourably released, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed forward is making progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticised since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres Doc.
The military lags behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrent that liability brings.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms occur," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers you watch on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent her anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed at a shooting in Norway in July, killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer until his attack and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing extremist groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS about digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, says that the researchers simply have to use the page's advertising tool to accurately define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the adds invited users to a survey that asked for their educational level, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to consult more than 10,000 followers from 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office even once.
"It's quite a new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and are annoyed by immigration .
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who remain sitting behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add an average of three content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people who you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"At Facebook, it all falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their frenzy on Facebook are increasingly inclined to problems than students who remained silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example, housing advisors, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly bombards the data of its own population.
The site's data team has created statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Glücks Index (where information was primarily used to which only Facebook has accessed - masters of digital freedom have long known that the page should make its large pit of data available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the page is watching them, whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to spend your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know something about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she is concerned, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and in articles are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who has stood two ramparts killing 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he told in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I raise appeal against the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't trust myself."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, since he "does not want to give Brooksik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform where he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to grant Breivik, who brought a speech in advance, to turn to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to remain in custody for 12 more weeks in pre-trial detention, and he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will closely control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remained behind the castle and bar.
Everyone participated with the aim that everything comes out on a lock-out path.
"I thought he seems cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I saw and listened to the suspects."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and looked quiet and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered the building and left.
Despite Breivik's bizarre reference, he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may have pleased some that the attacks of the 22. July apparently the work of a single extremist was and not that of a group of radicals.
But does it automatically make the sorrow and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the member of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 Lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5th October some compared it to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find the most revealing in the recently discovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the major markets is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who eagerly tinkered with diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer "an illness of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of work... [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Specialty idiosyncrasies" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat more than an hour with jobs, where they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, as a 10 year since jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiosyncrasies, he says that the interview's copy templates were missing from delivery.
Only after Jobs death was a complete VHS copy discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: Das verlorene Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to aboup deep into detailed interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds contemplation, in which jobs clearly weigh up his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems to react impatiently to Cringely's questions and attacks him to respond more quickly to topics or subplots of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview seems somehow incredibly far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies do their opinion right or wrong and represent his own vision of the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous appreciations of career jobs. But to see jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the go to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done this all here, he released and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interviews:
How he learned to run a company:
"During the whole years in business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, it's just done."
Nobody knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks about things in depth.
I have noticed that.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed how costs were recorded - mostly one began with "standard costs", which were estimated at mere assumption and which were then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest.
As the Pope became outdated:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could sneak into the telephone company and lead long-distance calls for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-authorization is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while laving as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you blacked into the phone, it came out one minute later in the phone next door," says Jobs chunkingly.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something that can control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he had almost withdrawn when they called in the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to speak to the Pope, while they were able to pursue Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came by phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and called on Bill Hewlett)
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with it.
I would climb up as a teenager at HP and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built up some boards, a client asked to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost 300 dollars] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to build for 15 pounds. That was incredibly believable.
About large companies that subside:
Long before he rekindled Apple, Jobs foresaw the paths in which so many industrial giants were stumbling and lost control of their shares with their visions.
"Can we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, well and?"
They own the investment monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are people who ultimately run the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is needed by people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times larger if Microsoft could have been the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's plenty of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make settings, certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, stealing great artists.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it had not been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically dividing question of whether to listen to a contest of President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, participated in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for exam.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health system that was passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to be the outcome of the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is being announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and will claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the result of the process enormously.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court discussed the case.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican parliamentary group in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending federalist society events for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, Richter frees himself from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were to be entitled to fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states the following: "A judge can participate in fundraising events law closer and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a guest of honour or, according to the programme, no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the case-related law firms and a company with a massive financial interest in this were enough to alarm moral and government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges, the court holds on to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinated at the court during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings."
Their appearance and support for a fundraising campaign for this event undermines and is unacceptable any claim to impartiality.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they are mixing court matters too easily with groups guided by the agenda, such as federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under the Obama administration when the first law challenges in first instance came to court.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case for bias, because she is too engaged in the defense of the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does no attempt to do so.
Boeing landed record order of 18 trillion dollars
Emirates orders 50 two-course Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company receives an order for 50 of its products.
But it is big business if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
The customer of Boeing is equally unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order of all time for commercial aircraft at the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order was made by Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, the airline also announced an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered the fuel consumption and the comfort of passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the planes. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cease or move aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection," he said.
Emirates' appointment reinforces Boeing's leading position in the market for widebody aircraft and helps to keep Airbus competitors SAS at bay, which attacks the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that the introduction of the largest A350 would be postponed, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more trust after customers had requested a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to 67.94.
Mexican president's sister seemingly loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer supported opponents Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the gubernatorial post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her bid for Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... They have occupied polling cabins, built road blockades ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have only narrowly beaten Claderon, which had had actually had been conducted in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative, the Conservative Party AcciÃ3n Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, the currently incumbent governor, came to three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless leftist leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is President Calderon's homeland and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
An PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during an election period for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates have withdrawn from the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reluctant the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the presidency race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory makes us look bravely into next year."
ADB pushes Asia for help in saving the Eurozone
The Asia Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the saving of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, ADB's administrative director based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies need to do "everything in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who are "spassion-free" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and Asian European resources helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has suffered a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe fuels fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls that the leading emerging economies must join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that all support for Asia from the IMF would be channelled, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - provides European partners in Asia with greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and the drying out of foreign capital flow.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an order, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help to Europe, more than 800 million of 2 dollars or even less a day live on the ground.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then there is a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, World Economic Forum's administrative director, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public-service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The ADB's forecast with economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/threatens "the risk of grading" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downtrend and significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent Pentagon Warnings for Potential Defense Sheets
Defense Minister Leon Panetta fueled the congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. He thus triggered a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the theaters of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts will be necessary by 600 trillion dollars or more if Congress cannot reach a closing in spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a congressional failure to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a lack of a way, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certainty in order to be able to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the beliefs of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were eventually hit the fighting troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious encroachment on the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personal attitudes have been cut, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of confiscating the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not to be imposed on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new senator warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts will remain aware.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly said the possible cuts, although he has gained many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and the White House before he came to the head of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a gloomy picture, which might be imminent - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is not able to take it with potential opponents."
"She actually makes you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details on how reductions "created significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disasters, serious constraints on our global ability to use and intervene, causing an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage.
This list includes fighter pilot F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, the Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If further developments and tests of the F35 were to be stopped, it would save up to 80 trillion dollars over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step towards rearmament, so that potential dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to uncover a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lie are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is concerned with mastering the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of the lie.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of perjury because it is allegedly withheld reports that a retired football coach has sexually abused boy.
This past week, when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to American President Barack Obama, he was part of an open microphone when it was a liar.
Lies are destroying careers and shocking countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool when he circulated denials, which were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations of campaign funding, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it, forgets the media circus triggered by President Bill Clinton when he lied to his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the exam answers so that they themselves were in good shape in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
However, many of these lies are considered emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize lies or "Decovering lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharades, the aim is to shout "Hab Dich!", the attacking of a deception is a reputable area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at respected universities that conducted extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look into your eyes.
They stutter, stammer, cloburize and do not always fidget.
However, one must not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and unmasked.
A skilled lying amateur can penetrate the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of unmasking. And it is clear that exposing a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find our own in our complex world, especially if posting or questioning individuals or negotiations or administration are among their own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions. And they intuitively feel them perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverted people, that men more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented towards others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often gnawing their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that if a person was exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of having lied to that person.
How do you recognize if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baseline", the starting position.
It sets a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, laughter, the vocal quality of your subject.
You better know when someone usually triples with their feet, so they don't wrongly blame them when he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of an unmasking.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show an "relaxation after the set-up conversation," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a talk is over, only to look for this relaxation for the recruitment interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
The Scott Peterson's slip-out is famous when he used the way of the past when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and caused a national search for her.
Deceptive persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Levinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in total.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "quarosetting language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of our knowledge and belief."
This makes the answer more apparent than factual, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic means to unmascing lies, but one can learn skills that make it possible to uncover.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become less likely to fall victim to fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after hazards from delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, thus angering the unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to reschedule the project so that one can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with another trend.
This led to an announcement by the Foreign Ministry last week, after which a decision was admitted regarding a federal approval for the project was postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may be postponed by 2013 a decision after the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama declared last week in a written statement that the decision was a task for the State Department and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta province to the Refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
They hate environmentalists, but they love labour markets, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are opposed to the plan, are weighing off the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the ministry's main examiner has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused as she allegedly forced an infant to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had a bout of attack, which would so afraid that she was overthrown in fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made 18 month-old Genevievek so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on the 10th place November last year, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with his luggage and Genevieve in the arm.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back in the arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman angrily.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I'm not interested in what you say or think."
She became angry and started to scold - she used the F word and the A word and became very noisy...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who still wore Genevieve in her arms, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which a statement was asked.
The complaint is not certain compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not pay any fees and plan the family, the money they receive, to donate the childhood cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is displayed to a kindergarten teacher who wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climatic adversities slowed the economy
In the first year, when Mario LÃ3pez Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, Sinaloa's economic history will be remembered. It is the first year in which Mario LÃ3pez Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and fueled great hopes about economic growth, is in government. However, growth cannot be said as a result of climate adversity, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in millions of agriculture, but also narrowly bordered the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter of the quarter, which fell mainly to the historical reduction in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to one of the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt. Mexican Sustainable Agricultural Development Council reported report on the effects of frost were damaged by 520,000 hectares of agricultural land, of which 78.03 per cent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed. The cultivation of vegetables, maize and chickpea cultivation was particularly affected.
The decline in economic activity until November has continuously increased unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de EstadÃostica y GeografÃa observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the first quarter, because from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo LÃ3pez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the University of AutÃ3noma (UAS), comments on the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who bannedly accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, to invest them or use them for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
LÃ3pez Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and are looking for work here, which will increase unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of employees working in the country without depositing into the social security offices.
Unemployment and undeclared work include the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexico Social Insurance Institution) and the SecretarÃa del Trabajo y PrevisiÃ3n Social (Graft and Social Care Office in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September; this is much less than the general government average, which is 7 375 pesos.
Decline of ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and growing unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) of the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to the SecretarÃa de EconomÃa (State Economic Authority), the FDI was 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a trend of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period last year.
For its part, the SecretarÃa de Desarrollo EconÃ3mico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280,000 pesos in 2011, which comes above all from companies in the Tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities to reactivate the economy. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effect on any of the sectors of the economy in the country could be found by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario LÃ3pez Valdés made the incapability of government apparently.
Miguel Loredo LÃ3pez, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la TransformaciÃ3n (State Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico), argued that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the terrain lost this year, and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of everyone, and in particular the progress of the well-interested team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo LÃ3pez said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently in motion to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That's why we will finish the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the ConfederaciÃ3n Patronal de la RepÃoblica Mexicana (Mexico's Association of Business) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be caused more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that there was any work. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
Coparmex, Chairman, stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that winds the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas about which it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that there has been worked on and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg Marijuana
To five years in prison and 100 days' sentences, a Navolato resident was sentenced to possess eight kilos of marijuana.
The prosecutor's office of the republic announced that the small drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana - destined for trade.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was founded on July 7th. Junio 2010 by Mexican military personnel in monitoring Cipriano Valdez against the Guard post number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato, arrested.
The small drug dealer drove in a white van, where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment is still in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants intended in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios PÃoblic and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds, or only by great delay, said Miguel Ã...ngel LÃ3pez Miranda.
The head of the city's social development authority said that although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now hanging in danger, because the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceeds 11 million pesos for the three programmes.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to nearly 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the FederaciÃ3n and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the termination of the building was to be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they had paid us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of JesÃos Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the community had to borrow at the beginning of its reign. This would be in line with the amount that the central government should have raised.
"We had already had this happened in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued, and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not spent to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although public authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance has been requested to speed up administrative work and pay the outstanding proportion as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approves transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The changeover of analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in recent years worldwide.
The Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree and by virtue of which the switching from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes required to contest law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe CalderÃ3n had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the decree of the statutory decree details of switching to digital terrestrial television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus the law remains in force.
The project for the lawsuit, which was drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television are responsible for the regulations concerning radio and television, the ComisiÃ3n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunications Commission in Mexico), which would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservation.
Only ZaldÃ3var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree on the Legislative Decree. After the lawsuits have been adopted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to set up digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, which was also responsible for by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that they did not agree with the project's arguments, in the sense that the state government must not regulate the measures that public administration should take with general rules.
"I also don't believe that if you did that, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it leads state affairs.
Replacing the analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place in recent years around the world, and it makes better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponing of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the benefits of digitisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which does not only have technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system required, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already undergone the digital transition, through the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government intervenes in the competences of the Congress by handing over the contested decree, because the laws passed by the legislature were complied with," she assured.
The possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes not yet counted out of 6074.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballot papers is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is almost 27 percent, whereby 879 votes out of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, has reminded us that just last 9. November the electoral office had adopted a number of regulations to harmonise local regulations with state reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted either his political constitution or electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not emerged in this round of voting. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the state vacsator within the deadlines provided for this, arguing that they still have objections to them.
On the 9th November, the Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and assessed the vote of the State Commissioner on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because he does not have the right to "decide on it or veto it."
In an interview about the possibility of the individual counting of votes, Maria de los ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballot papers in part or in full.
For example, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages can be counted in part The results in the minutes do not agree; the record on vote counting and calculating is not available on the file or it is not the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the overall counting of the fully completed polling cards can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request by the party or. Coalition chairmen, who is the second of these candidates.
The counting of votes can also take place in their entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that were suspended from a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 votes have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
Its ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the funeral show and a funeral mass took place.
According to family members, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honour, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila in the accident of the killed in the accident of the Mexican Air Force. The most popular persons attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to join the Zapopán Air Force school, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even become dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strove to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as if on the occasion, when he brought Martha SahagÃ3n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had driven to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: a plane flying.

The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel presented the media with eleven people who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found by shots in different body parts and a shot of mercy in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo LeÃ3n.

Wednesday Education of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government that is to stand up to the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present to him the new government that is to stand up to the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A notice from the presidential palace announced that the Sunday appointed Monti would meet with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet of a majority technocratic cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government to the President.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well defined," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt into an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by the euro policies in order to regain the burden of confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti continues to strengthen due to the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian government bonds were weighed at 7 percent interest for 10 years. This is the state at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industry Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would do this government to support this government to the best of our ability."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to come out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's party, which had to step down as a result of the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Center Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting mainly of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again cause a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks also exerts pressure from saying that Monti's failure is a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The session shall be completed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set an extremely rapid change of government in motion in response to the crisis.
After a recent breath towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would step down, the cost of Italian government bonds has regained critical limits as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
A bailout of Italy with a sovereign debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predicting that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of prefering to the elections.
Monti said he would like politicians to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that mutual distrust and the disagreements between the parties make the involvement of individuals from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more playing opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten over 50 international matches have under its belt.
On Costa Rica's pages, only one of the 22 called-ups has had 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the players from both countries are compared to the 22 players from both countries for the friendly match, which takes place today at 15:05 in the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champion, the number one on the monthly ranking of FIFA, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection matches, the three-colour team is only a favourite defence player Michael Umana, the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking Europa Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish Furie at complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings as part of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see the Spanish team drawing their last register: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta on last Saturday against England (deposit 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign matches.
Casillas will play today against the three-coloured team and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona Football Club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the Zubizarreta quoted with 126 and the centre forward of Schalke, RaÃol González, with 102.
The number hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side pages and close to Michael Umana are the left side striker JÃ3nior DÃ3az with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on there came on only five on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis LÃ3pez with 35.
Those with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games are available on Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), lvaro Arbeloa (31) and RaÃol Albiol (31).
From the national team come less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest does not approach even the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded only one in Costa Rica VÃ3ctor Bolivar and Ã...lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
The historic goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored nine with the most goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twenty years
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive talk with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that for them a dream is realized when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bass player and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twenty-year existence and on Sunday 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 7.30 pm.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La NaciÃ3n.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream is achieved when Pearl Jam is set in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also realized for us.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I was only once on a holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will certainly stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to get our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. You will experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you, to have waited so long and it does us suffer to have taken so long until we have come here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't this exert a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have had in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played at a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like surfing and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for this.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always travelled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we set ourselves no boundaries.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we will play each is not easy.
When we include two or three songs that we haven't played in the repertoire for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty year history.
If you look back, it is hard for you to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us imagined to play in a great rock band once, and that for more than 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together.
We like ourselves and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honour to belong to this group of large bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we are still playing together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are happy to be friends with all of them and it honors us to be part of this emerged Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours to have stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all consider ourselves happy to be still alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up to give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music. We couldn't go better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure you don't be on tour too often, because it's too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds that love your music.
As long as you think that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has launched, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We have never been interested in this anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a volume for three years that had never edited a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good at friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who set up the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It has always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band therefore chose for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I believe he sings the first thing he thinks of.
Who was you influenced as a bass player?
Of so many+
Among the first to come up with me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bass players I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I believe we all feel not very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, I can think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and everyone else who came up at the same time. Although they are still important today, I think it's great, because it's worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now it is more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lightweight. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
I was tearing when I heard Ed played her. They are very dark songs.
I believe that as you get older and something traumatic thing happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is suffering 25 years imprisonment for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a congress member and his personal physician, told the television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas Hospital to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he think he was innocent.
He has surgery four times on tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor included.
Since September 2007, Fujimori has been located in the DirecciÃ3n Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policÃa prison.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly engaged during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderon. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the culmination of his fully booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "intends to exchange information about all policy areas between the two countries," the presidency of the South American country announced on his website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking CalderÃ3n's support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a tax haven list at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still occur as tax havens from the international community. This declaration was rejected by Uruguay and prompted his ambassador to the European country.
Since November, Mexico has had the presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialised countries. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid the double investment with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretisation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This is what countries are based on countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The purred plumber enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but until now never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the counters of the world this month has been tailored to the characteristics of the Nintend 3DS portable console, which can be used to play three-dimensionally without special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Alvarez, who is responsible for the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo, which has been developed for this console from the beginning" , because so far successive articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were already adjustments to existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman underlined that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "affordable" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less crazy users.
After that, the experts can make a "second round" about the different game levels, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. To overcome the obstacles without becoming victims of the "optical effects", however, it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This excursion Super Mario's three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo wins over the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: the purple installer has to overcome platforms pushed with dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's delivery to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Alvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder the USD 70 million.
Thus, the trial of the USA's application for the extradition of Portillo ends so that it can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial authority and the government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he had not interfered in court decisions and had granted all extradition requests of which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano MarroquÃ3n are at the mail of murder and serious assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and VÃ3ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action is a governmental act that occurs when all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to condemn the former state president (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if its legal situation in Guatemala has been clarified and its human rights is guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This hearing was preceded by extradition, but the minister filed a contradiction and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened with social exclusion
The organisation was launched to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the social welfare organisation Trinijove have yielded important results: in this quarter of a century, 6,000 young people, threatened with social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took part, was taken stock yesterday.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with little educational level, without work, with drug problems that were threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous managers of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions in election campaigns proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-green city councillor Ricard Goma, were attended.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also attended by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep LluÃ3s Cleries, and the General Director of the Social Works of the Savings Bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The homeowners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house no. 51 have come to an end on the street Balmes.
Yesterday noon twelve people voluntarily left the building they had occupied illegally afternoon and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was done by court order without police intervention.
After the clearance, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"Admission will be checked now," confirmed the property manager.
The squatters, 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical facility and part of the water supply with it. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also caused damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained that its business had declined by 80% since the start of the staff.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters were making their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure restaurant had been reported by the neighbours because of disturbance of rest, while according to her statement, the noise was not steady from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular by the guests of the festivals who were organized there, and who, according to the disgruntled neighbours, have become more and longer in recent weeks.
The head of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not having to pay rent for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from its neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Diaz, had called last week to remove the building immediately and to get to grips with the problems of civil coexistence and the downcoming of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but that in recent months the squatters had reached all floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some there were even thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the antisocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 pm, the police approached the Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanted to penetrate the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The municipal call for proposals on the 16 goals opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared CorporaciÃ3n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its assumption on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many again, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and bottom (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
The role model now no longer served as Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogi bear.
So far was when the city spent a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it is so, or someone shall come forward to put doors to the countryside.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call is not only from an organisational point of view, but also with regard to reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent topic that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back on.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, "it is "necessary" to speak about the "front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefon Cerda, which has not been fought over the green apples.
"It should be based on the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined as "as accesses to a park, but as a limitation of areas where action must be traded."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that holds "some dangers".
Dangers caused by the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" according to the experiences from the 1980s that had their "swan song" in the area of the Forum.
The first fear is the own limitation on what may be developed.
"Bounding something always means determining the next step," i.e. to cross it.
"One has to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who sticks more closely to the question, simply means the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronage of Collserola that should not "push deaf" even though he is grateful to the city administration that it has given its body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he expresses his "doubt" in whether this technical profile should guide the newly created multidisciplinary teams ("the right thing", he says, "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, since the tendering conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "16 competitions in cross-section were put out," he says, "on the axis of mountains. But there is no longitudinal perspective that the area considers in its entirety."
This has led to him participating in the 16 competitions, at least in his case.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped in its entire length directly above the Ronda de Dalt, which is created by a soft transition between the city and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazáábal is released after the Casino Red agent gave him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which is leading the trial of the mayor of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination attempt on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of the Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who allegedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration authorizes the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the Panist Mayor, who was held on 2nd. September was arrested for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio PÃoblico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained in this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio PÃoblico had rejected the crimes committed for bribery and organized crime.
On the 19th In October, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he had allegedly bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained in the middle security section for only a few hours, as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On the 25th In October, he was sent a detention decree by Jorge Yánez, Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District. This noted that after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to speak guilty to Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the competition house in order to be able to open it in return.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, asked the judge José Luis Pecina to enact the mayor's brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the ministerio PÃoblico, assigned to the court, asked whether he had repaired the damage and the owner of the competition house had forgiveed. The lawyer held the name back.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is spoken freely. In the following, no objections to the trial can be filed, and no damages are required.
After the hearing of the occupancy officer at around 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal BretÃ3n was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he was acquitted and that his case was being filed.
He also informed him about the judicial order for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome provides details of the aircraft accident, which was killed by the government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people.
The SecretarÃa de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other seven people were killed, indicate that the helicopter with its entire unspoiled structure directly against the ground, without the pilot being an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport, mentioned that the pilot confirmed before the take-off that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to point out that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting the staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the plane had come down.
"When searching, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a bevel of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is paramount to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto LÃ3pez Meyer, CEO of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliaries (Secretariat for Airplanes and Aid Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidencial at a premium with cruising flight and that the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points, which should be considered in the investigation:
Visibility flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at start. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state, some low-hanging clouds rose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter agree. There may have been neither a loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to date indicates that the helicopter had been bounced straight and lateral.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter had bounced onto the ground with its unspoilt structure.
No indication of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer neither fir nor explosion at the scene of the accident.
The last investigation results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a bevel of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke down.
Some information indicates that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search on an area that went beyond the closed area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had hit the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene of Obesity
She Social Security Agency of Mexico leads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents entitled "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence", with which the genetic markers are to be found in connection with overweight.
Miguel Cruz LÃ3pez, head of the Unidad de InvestigaciÃ3n Médica en BioquÃ3mica (Department of Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team was established consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud PÃoblica (INSP) and at the Centro de InvestigaciÃ3n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Those interested can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8 am.
He stressed that the study began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in western the state of México) and since the 8th edition of the sports ground. October will be continued on the sports field of NezahualcÃ3yolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and concluded on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the diabetes day worldwide, he said it was intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with their parents' consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of the disease in order to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal failure.
He further stated that on the aforementioned Saturdays the examining subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure controls and determined blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (treat of identifying genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz LÃ3pez stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in almost six years the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity has also increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that an (e) Mexican (in) is an average of 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that there was a direct benefit for the participants in the examiners in a comprehensive study of the children, in which it would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and ox (anthosis) that indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and provided to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all the measurement results to their parents and propose them changes in their lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz LÃ3pez explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. a lack of exercise in everyday life, to spend most of the day in front of the television and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics, which are to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM University of Mexico, develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention paid to the signs caused by the street surface, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes if the rainy season breaks out at the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the s.
In his lecture "Sustinkerholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphaltes with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with an extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low one - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the street covering its characteristic tough elastic behaviour.
Tightening behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and almost fixed at 50°C, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The researcher at FQ noticed that the majority of the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road surface consisting of six layers of material, the last three asphalts.
Between the upper layers lie a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones, which consists of small stones, bathed in asphalt.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move onto them and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "is designed a last layer, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it has to produce friction.
The most forces that this road surface receives and distributes, the base layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be considered, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates the layer and comes out only difficult. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the top layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that would have to be maintained at the initial signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load was another important cause of the appearance of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of every layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research was still frequent, for example, about asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be easily repaired without the application of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected the fact that Melina RamÃ3rez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14th largest edition. Missitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty-handed at the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina RamÃ3rez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the winning podium, a silver crown and the volume she shows as a new misconception.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department comes to 14 misdenumerations and Melina joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. Proclaimed Misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara DomÃ3nguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena lvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga MarÃoa Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), MÃ3nica Evers (1989), MarÃa Consuela Pinedo (1990), Isabel Romero (1990), Alums(2008).
The big question that many people are asking themselves today is: what was missing?
The result corresponds to the decline of a large favourite who had shown at every performance that she had had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been chosen as Queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of the Lady of Colombia.
The first factor, which is considered decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as the First Miss, is that she did not convince the answer to the question "Which book has affected you most and why?", which had been asked by MartÃ3n Murillo GÃ3mez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing, ultimately I believe that the book that had the strongest shape for my childhood is a rather deep book.
Currently I read 'guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that says 'passion'.
An answer that came across less popularity, firstly because of the term 'civilize' and secondly, because she had not concretely explained how each book it mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens, it has to happen.
And for all people: please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred, who had received all attacks and had received all prizes in advance (Gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote about the best tailor-made costume and Reina Madre), "which had jealously done to other candidates what the Queen stressed, who couldn't shine on stage."
And this was noticed during her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two lifts at the coronation party.
Although she occurred safely with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned "that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition eventually does not become queen".
In addition, Valle went out of the way of the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was not able to convince the jurisdiction of its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
It will have its reason why, two days before the compilation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and concentrate on the social feeling, on the fact that she had worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the derrier and fibrosis, which was shown in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was hard to be noticed for me, squeezed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to make it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay this point."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction was made after the swimsuit performance, which was to come true at night. It was cuddled that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is competing in her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the National Cultures contest in one of the international competitions.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
This is how the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lithoscope from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On the former 4. November, a lophoscope member of the prosecutor's office (CTI) investigation unit from Cali went into being the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia Revolutionary Armies): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the division of the CTI, this week Eliazar González had prepared standby service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working on criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of ChocÃ3, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was to identify.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hands of the hands and foot.
In the week of the mission against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one of the man who had headed the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger printed sheet of Guillermo LeÃ3n Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located, he could not identify it due to his physical appearance, because it did not resemble the figures he had seen in the mass media in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wearing no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints are not lying.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a boxer and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the print sheet.
He had right seen: it was "Alfonso Cano".
Even the same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos PinzÃ3n, to announce that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for traces
For a dactycope from the SijÃ3n in Cali, the appreciation that President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González had received at a press conference on the deployment against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without error rates, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery matters and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many criminals present false identification documents or they do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house when he was theft, because the thief had been installed with his hand at this very point when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewellery and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for the decrease in fingerprints. But in this case, we were able to take the whole hand's imprint and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or loaded.
Recently a dead man was found surrounded by schnapps bottles.
When it was determined, it was assumed that a family member could be suspected, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is nevertheless linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A dactylicoscopicist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents are taken from the object."
If they appear, a planter or a band is used to carry it.
After that, the imprints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the civil status office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," said the expert from CTI.
He said that not everything was the same as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is, what shines, is not everything you touch, a fingerprint.
But still it can be used if you perform a corresponding comparison.
The "outrags" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded together in tents on Zuccotti Square.
The population followed the clearance order and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday when they tried to enter Manhatten Square again with a court order after being cleared off the pitch at dawn and tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access with a judicial order that allowed the "outraging" to camp again at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the move held on the eviction order and occupied one park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we come together in another place and continue the battle with legal means of returning to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons for the "Ocupy Wall Street" movement.
Bray said that the "outraged" answer to the clearance of her camp, which was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the tilt tilting and approved the demonstrators' tents.
In addition, the "outrags" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the town for at least an hour. But after that, the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists handcuffs.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had come to the place where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday and to analyse the legality of the eviction held at dawn.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen who guarded the square, which resulted in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had reported that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities from vacating Occupy Wall Street members from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation, prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had already used before."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that, on the basis of this judge, the reopening of the square for the public traffic and the demonstrators has been abolished. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square, which was arrested at dawn, where almost 200 people were arrested, and who was decided because the demonstrators "didate the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement to evacuate the place because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others," because "some businesses had received threats" and local residents "banged for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Those responsible of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they want to organize "great actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to the two months who had been protesting since the 17th. September now already last, to think.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities she will be on 1. December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" perform
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in Home Improvement, lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas programme of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balladal singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on the 1st. December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" will perform and breathe life into a very special virgin Maria.
Today CTV spread pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - also for spreading on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drum player of "Mötle Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as a virgin Maria with a puppet in the womb that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin, who recently worked as a presenter on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a child of Jesus.
The Christmas programme of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé had described the North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake that ended up in a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan was the 2nd largest catastrophe. World War I.
The first estimates by the government in Tokyo assessed property damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of a fall, GDP from July to September was used to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the year's projected quota.
The figure measured in the second quarter - starts in Japan in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on keynesiac impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been compromised thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, initiated by the growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has trusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - moving into one of the "refugee currencies" of investors who flee from the debt crisis of the eurozone and the murky forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a gravestone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attribute their weak business results from July to September to the yen listed.
While the markets continue to beiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko government remains alert.
"One must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very cheerful.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which aticipates the turning points of the global economy, showed that the brake would be drawn among the biggest economic potions.
Because it dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is at 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13.
Athens again gives doubt
Papadimos says the austerity measures are adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums driven up by the peripheral countries and spreading uncertainty, Greece is moving away in the labyrinth that is leading out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being proven by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed in his appointment were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he supported the new austerity measures and that his demand for new elections on the planned date, the 19. February, will take back.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions at the summit of 26 Previously assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication does not express the doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but we have nothing else to do so."
The conservative leader went one step too far with its challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million that Athens urgently needs. He made it clear that he would not endorse a declaration of commitment to the fulfilment of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the game of poker with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties were not signed "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika's inspectors "very soon" came back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what was "needed for the payment of the sixth section" in the amount of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek ball still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide."
The Queen of Spain reminded us yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor for this means of international cooperation in the world. Its "beings" are based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on micro-credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the thinal targets set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with the number of people who have to live on incomes of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty line".
Spain "continues" to the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is performing this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit that lasts until Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for the impetus of "two fundamental goals".
The Queen said that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to this financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line by the end of 2015.
The conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world is based on the path "Marim Yunus, initiated years ago" by Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. Everyone has "can observe continuous development," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her to her the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as a "advocate of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to finding solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic boom, since it was a "persistent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that microcredits were a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the advanced economies now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and not allow the solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, micro-credits are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success", "marginalized" people to "lend "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier LeÃ3n de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opens "their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14th For Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, he was in Leipzig without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally intended for the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to enough for those activists who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The Presidency proposal of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten had abstained.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which initially had Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees, were not open to any doubt by the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea bears the following slogan - as does the proposals - the answer to the crisis" is not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also there "new millions of jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the chancellor," has come the time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, which reinforces the European Union's control of the European Union, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission based on general voting, "to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which was clearly the godfather of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
The milestone, however, has been set.
Likewise, the overwhelming majority have rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB board, in line with the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously lead to an increase in Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned about pacifying the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference for Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has no longer tried to win its congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticise arrogant Germany.
As far as the European motion of the importance of "German-French friendship" dedicates a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France to the scene.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago, Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the too most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sick leave?
After the family allowances, the UMP and the government are now tackling the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, the 15th November to enter Bordeaux to consult a family aid fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been always recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to undergo the economy in a hardship, but on the other hand is no less harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' suffering reports.
First of all, with fiscal objectives: the government is committing the introduction of a fourth day of maternity before taking into account a sick notification for private sector workers.
In good German this means that a sick employee would lose the wage of four days without the granting of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
However, a measure that threatens to provoke anger according to the daily "Les Echos" would help to bring in EUR 280 million.
And the one with a different nature is associated with a rather symbolic character: to grant the state officials an untreated Goods Day in the event of illness (so far there is no maternity period for them, in contrast to the three days of waiting in the private sector).
While discussing these issues, the majority is also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time aiming at the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controls will be much more important, and they will also be refunded if this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, the 13th edition of the day. November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of sick notification.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives since 2002, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no longer sick than people in Europe elsewhere.
However, let us first visit the national figures.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the economic research and documentation institute of the health sector, the daily compensation in 2008 represented 5% of health expenditure of 11.3 billion euros.
Under this amount, 46% fell in terms of maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% on sick leave, the hey 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% health spending.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 days of their sick than the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that covers up certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, pointed out that 75% of the 40th anniversary. 000 surveyed, French employees, not having taken a single day of sickness.
Another study covered by the health insurance this year makes it clear that 37% of sick notifications in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over them.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers therefore no longer tend to be incapacitated as elsewhere.
A long-term study, conducted by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS), showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (based or otherwise justified) in France oscillated between 10% and 11%, contrary to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick leave is a small percentage of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak excait is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systatic checks on sick leave, exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college for training and further education of technicians and engineers) found out of 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 of the 285,000 of the twenty-fold occurrence, which was hot in 37,050 cases "unjustified or too long".
In the case of the systematically controlled cases of sick notification of more than 45 days duration, among 1.2 million 11% was numbered "inconformed or unjustified" cases, the hey 132,000.
In total, this means that this accounts for 160,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have repeated a sick notification.
A figure that represents only a weak ausmaÃ3 compared to that of undeclared work, for example.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this question, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in tax earnings per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day remuneration, and thus much more than the defraudation in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to capture its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, with Adding, to the fact that those of his government granted by the Union for one hundred days were not enough to do this task.
"To continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the Euro Summit on the 27th end of the meeting on the occasion of the meeting. Decisions made in October is the "main task" of the new government, because the country's involvement within the eurozone would be "at the stake" he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's state deficit to reduce the 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval to the already approved measures on an attempt to escape from the debt crisis on Monday, but had suggested that his party would not earn an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a deputy meeting of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to meet the guidelines for reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as to combat waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner entrusted with economic and currency tasks, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee by all parties to support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would satisfy his word and he would not sign anything under pressure from what to include.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to an expert panel
The Canadians are living in refusal of death, as shown by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving resources, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, who are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in this way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is taking place, namely in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada is on the 10th place. Ranked rank, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture where people are afraid to raise the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to pain-keeping funds, say the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of these ultimately die in hospital.
From the entire country, the rate is highest at 86% of hospital deaths in Quebec.
In the delicate question regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already suckled, do not want to make any changes to the penal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide, are opposed.
However, according to the experts, all those countries whose approach have legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no proof that such decriminalisation would result in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are met, especially in those countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the euthanasia
Let us remember that according to a Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already slandered themselves in favour of euthanasia, since they believe that they allow people to alleviate their sufferings at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the facts of legalizing euthanasia do not lead to conveying the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people were less valuable.
With regard to the people who have already practised an accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents think that they should not be prosecuted.
According to the authors of the report, the authors of the report present itself as less as regards the maintenance or cessation of the funds in patients.
Likewise, these suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the discontinuation of the funds for which a valid refusal had been presented should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the destination of the means at the end of life, and to fear this without being prosecuted.
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain-relieving resources in terms of pain-relieving treatment, and going beyond cancer cases.
Most recently, the body calls for, with regard to the far-reaching means of pain relief or life-restricted measures, already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, to at least consider them, since they did not serve to reduce physical pain and to reduce them to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, as "extreme", since they do not set any limits to euthanasia practice in the sick during the final phase.
"This opens up the doors to a situation in which everyone who is tired of life than 18 years of age to ask another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who yesterday reviewed a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's responsibility for all other values involved in the social garrison of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report she entitled as a "pro-euuthanas manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports regarding the failure to absute in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanyed suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad yesterday demonstrated to the authorities of the Ministry of Foren.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad, which, however, counters itself thanks to Russia's support and rejects a "plot" against the country, was reinforced yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, even though Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favour of President Assad resigning.
King Abdullah II Yesterday, Jordan was the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "lay down his power of office in Syria," in which forty civilians and members of the government's power had already been killed.
"Lahl Baschar's interest in his country at heart, he would cede, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish head of diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year were not successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and who cannot satisfy them must go," he said in allusion to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily rough attitude.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "impination of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"In view of the repression in Syria, Mark Toner, observed, a spokesman for the state division, observed. "In view of Turkey, the international community, the EU, the EU, the Arab League, and countries such as Turkey have hit an ever-increasing tone.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the governmental power in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have been killed, thus announcing the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in "Shot changes and heavy bombings about Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister of AuÃ3entrader, Walid al-Muallim, nevertheless believed that the land "taxes on the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted forcefully to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from his tasks, which in his opinion was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added under the affirmative that "the frame-forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Solag Trade Minister Alain Juppé also spoke out in favour of sending UN observers in order to protect civilians from repression of the regime that after he was encapsulated into his "Paranoia".
An advanced meeting of the league is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to implement the implementation of the 2nd edition of the league. Planes decided to discuss the crisis rise in November, but in particular the controversial, probable withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Minister of the Architects Sergei Lavrov yesterday classified the Arab League's decision as "unrefect" in order to beware of granting possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to patience and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the creditworthiness lost during the recent months of the Berlusconi government.
Yesterday, the former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties before the meeting of trade unions and employers today.
It was his task to convene a cabinet to parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after having met with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had awaited, which Mario Monti is making a vote of confidence to Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be made in the by M. Monti's presentation of a deletion list culminating, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen of ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In"a democracy, there are certain deadlines to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, remarking that it was "sure that the markets will be patient and understanding."
His appointment by the president was welcomed by the markets at the beginning, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should found a staff of predominantly technocrats, even though he had emphasized that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive proof of confidence from the parliament by Friday.
M. Since the assumption of his role, Monti has committed himself to working in all urgency in the interests of the goal of "making Italy the "protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis to the Italian economy does not change even taking account of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its target of budget compensation in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has requested new hardship measures in particular.
Emma Marcegaglia, "Chief of the Chefs" of Italy, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus," a country that has no growth whatsoever that cannot respect deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of epoch" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" and a "different Italy", said the leading article authors.
The large unknown here was the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros in state bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientists help Iran's nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, confirmed an American NGO specialising in nuclear risks on Monday.
The ISIS Institute for Science and International Security is based on the recent report by the International Nuclear Safety AIEA agency and other documents based on this UN agency to investigate this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had communicated its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the in-depth studies of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosions.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to found a company in Kiev that manufactures "Nano Diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company in 1995 led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA "strong evidence mentioned that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only very familiar with this technology, but also, as a state member told the agency, his entire professional career had worked on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin throughout indispensable."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes either decreased slightly or have only slightly increased in the same period, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of crimes of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease against Jewish crimes and a global increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "red-motivated crime" has risen to 6,628 cases in very weak Mae, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% of religious differences of motivated crime, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, these crimes and crimes are worrying to see these crimes and crimes once again increase," stressed the human rights organisation Human Rights First.The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organisation in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violence of the law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a person responsible for the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, assessing that this could be done while improving the police attitude towards "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" presents itself in US federal law as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence directed against race, colour, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter converts the platform and similar more and more Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday, in particular to enable its users to monitor the activities of those who follow their entries, which once again makes the service similar to that of Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and another "name" allow for a better legible live understanding of the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users, whose news ("tweets") you follow and track your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow their messages to be tracked, whether to subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general internet distribution on Monday" in August at a small percentage of users," said Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its less instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat esthermally appearing wording (RT for the referenced repeat of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ai un public plus large avec un maniement comparable a celui des .
Users debated in the network via this innovation using certain "tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and corresponds too much Facebook," writes Ã...jemb123.
"The "Function" Activity" will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," announced 'dannyc current.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the top credit rating (AAA) quality.
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, even though the Austrian public sovereign debt is 74.6%, that is, much above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt levels of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen in a row from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also makes a demand from the Brussels summit of the euro area member states of 26 June. October held: The heads of state and government had demanded the inclusion of reducing public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public account balance into the constitution or by issuing an equivalent law.
The measurement taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to have included such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, from 2017 the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states as well as municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eradicate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement within the scope of 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens to join new currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authority would intervene again on the currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"If we set out excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene as much as we did last," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen again rose up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities reached on 31st. October had been forced to intervene.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of heading a new record against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen regularly above it, doctored by purchases from investors who see the yen as a "to beegate value" in these uncertain times of the world economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped under the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that the last intervention had triggered.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar was recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese motto is damaging the exports of the archipelago, as it makes the cost of "Made in Japan" products more expensive and reduces the income value derived by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan is fighting after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11. March, which the Tohoku region (northeast) devastated, for its reconstruction," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this yen's high rates can already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter, the third economic power has once again gained mercy on -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the sharp increase in exports and consumption of the households "plamted" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the inflation of the Yen does not "reflective the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to seize all possible measures to refute the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has informed the BoJ that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", which yielded to be announced that no additional currency relaxation is to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) by redeeming the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial stocks to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest fees fast, stock exchanges are making pullbacks
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the holding of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are constantly increasing.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting this Tuesday, 15. November even more in negative realms.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions regarding government bond yields in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets are continuing to release part of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which itself is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe, that the debt crisis continued, had closed with a bearing of 0.7%.
""Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates co-insucinated cinema, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the eurozone’s future damages the single currency that continues its moring on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for one and a half months.
Around 10 o'clock the European value was worth 1.3570 Doller, so it fell by 0.4%.
According to the stock market brokers, she went back after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, who gathered in Congress on Monday, had granted a motion that provides in particular for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% mark.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning the return of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% to 10 years, while that of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investors' fears.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed the implementation of the passage on the occasion of the 27th October Eurozone Summit decisions made are "the main task of his government."
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread rates between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% driven by budget consumption in the third quarter, ergoing a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE Federal Statistical Office had revised the bearish in the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economists most.
For its part, Germany had growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts Should Win about Dogmas
If there is a topic that must not be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies in direct nature.
It is sensible to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explodes the entire economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, not an enormous proportion of the world's population should have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to be able to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to live in its decision to refrain from nuclear power in isolation.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to find a source of replacement substitutes, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to integrate another unit to its park by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was closed down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as a model, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increase in energy dependence on Russia, particularly on Russia, an increase in the CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is European championship leader in wind energy, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; due to its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French budgets.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability deposit of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which would become illusions by the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
Polls showed that there was a price that the great majority of the French is just as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build up an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decided to phase out nuclear power, a majority of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would an EPR designed to work on sixty years if the decline of its producer is inevitable?
In order to solve the energetic equation, it must be admitted that there is no miracle cure for the production of electricity as there is just as a devil's work.
The CO2-low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as in the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just to be obsessed with the security presentation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; thus it went without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction and innocent human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident as it did after the two preceding the two.
As a fruit of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to resilience to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electricians to build a nuclear power plant, a halt to construction in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, allowing them to unleash the leading position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would irresponsible be to let emotions, dogmas and party guns dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from many angles - overload of police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had entitled itself.
Recently, the anti-foreign student harassment had marked the official respects of the weekly, the Minister of the Interior had passing (see Libération of the 23rd May) announces that France" does not need talents, masons or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
In fact, there is a far-reaching consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right side, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country," Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not absorb the entire poverty of the world."
The only difference is in the degree of size of size
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from both the right and the left.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the strict amount of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande limits itself in his programme to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "related problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the immigrants' flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would refute growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatened to substitute the local workers, especially the lower qualified ones, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than than domestic wage workers, since they focus on professions in sectors that are unburdened in terms of activity.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that poorly irritate local wage workers, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anaesthetists, this complementarity also means a positive effect of immigrants on wages and the domestic labour market situation between locals and migrants.
In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants caused a considered, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without regard to the fact that the diversity of ideas brought by immigrants beneath and economic growth is conducive (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries, at an average of 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that at the age of 30, a person who immigrated to Germany earns the public budget on average a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections with the teeth to take his mandate.
However, these teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remind itself of who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20. The tragedies of the First World War, Totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece had lost to himself.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way, in order to see democracy prevailing once and for all over their enemies.
Since Napoleon, the little one knows that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become just as well a "suppression instrument" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of the powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a justice system.
The crisis in Europe we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a crisis in the political and democracy.
The change of attitude of the Greek false referendum would have been doubly revealing in this respect: first of all, the necessity of a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized in dependence on the necessities and in a wrong order.
A licence for the European sole ruler or a leap blindfolded into the emptiness of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want a collective task, rightly, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no longer a known where to put an end to the list - since there is only one crisis, and they are in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - and it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to give the leadership of the European project back to the popular sovereignty.
Because it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and tackle a future through investment.
The withdrawal from the crisis is a conditional on European level, which cannot be reached without total democratic legitimacy, without certainly leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has been fought over for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic leadership to do so.
Inherently.
But this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it seems to the citizens - would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We need to take a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it required the fact of "creation" to Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not satisfy here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to be a more integrated Europe at an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty, a more democratic one.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become common property
The world trade fair for smart cards opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday in an optimistic stance.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was actually intended to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most supportive segment is the contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or settle purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold one year before, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after it has long been lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 non-contact visa cards were distributed.
However, the consumer markets are shutting down.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to at a higher rate, it is now necessary for the banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing over debit cards to their customers, which are equipped with a contactless chip in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A small percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They are in default."
"But at least next year they should experience a real upside world."
"We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it had planned to prepare the market launch of an offer that enables its customers to pay contactlessly via mobile phone.
Terrorist Front knows how to do, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long-standing relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian vice-state Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty."
"The way in which both organisations are taking action and the secret services' relations indicate clear cooperation," he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger, which took place last January, had now encouraged interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey, were killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French specialties.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the rubble at the site of operation that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls held leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long spent time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is closely known as the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but one must undoubtedly wait for clearer evidence before one can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It is conceivable, however."
"For years, it has been known that the cult receives financial and intellectual support from AuÃ3en and that it is becoming increasingly active," mitigates the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In these last few months, these "support achievements" have become increasingly obvious in their course, as have the speeches and the modes of operations of Boko Harem, which now indicate the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start at Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since then to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long considered the group to be considered an Illuminati community, to which no special attention needed to be paid.
Fast success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "the Western education is a shame" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is rapidly successful.
It politicises itself and claims strict compliance with Sharia law, while the activists affiliated it are fighting against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in their sights.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed themselves particularly active with their increased attacks against the commissioning port eras.
However, the reaction by Abuja is indifferent as usual.
The army surrounds the city, 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken captive, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, they committed themselves to an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is allocated the guilt of a suicide bombing attack that occurred at the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will become a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been worried since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat at the continent's centre.
Last week, at a talk with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Harem and showed himself ready to say "say all information."
The World in Accompanied by Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and helping Israel.
Can a crisis-weak America have a complex world with simple, not to say: lead simple ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters could almost get this impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have repeatedly made their thunderous statements, as well as their statements regarding the policy of the Au-en, traditional Republican focus.
On China, Iran and Israel aid, often in no way supported, slogans are covered.
The Chinese in front of the WTO were the highest-priced regarding the "Grand Old Party" in the course of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" threatened to quote the Chinese people and accept them of "currency manipulation" - a leading issue in an America that is caused by the brain drain to Asia.
Stupid if this imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auenpolitik, has almost fuelled the air in terms of his flattering behavior of the emotions.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard because he is stagnating in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military blows against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he had tinned.
"If Obama was re-elected, they get the bomb."
He has also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of keeping obligations guilty to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, a second highest-ranking candidate, in turn, displays a shameful knowledge of the file.
He recently called for counter-the-ranking of the Chinese military threat, because Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to leave the fact that China has been owning military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military blows against Iran, is sooty, making it ready to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The recourse to torture measures against mutab terrorists, which Obama prohibited by 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an outward political heavyweight.
The current presidential companies, Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all this.
They remind you that Obama is also an amateur himself and had to give water in his wine, which concerned the issue of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, its indecision in Libya, which also earned it the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite as casual.
The population values the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has switched off.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that are leading to weakening.
And Obama is more surprised by argueing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to bring his leadership position to life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline directly on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday last Tuesday and, at the Foodty Grand P.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the valve's wheel together, which transports the Russian gas into the western European network.
The new gas pipe is to supply 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas to Western Europe per year through the first 1,224 km pipeline that connects the St Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line is already being suspended on the track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous structure seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it will now become more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to enter Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not previously drawn back to comparing the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is hypersensitive, politically specifically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through its support for this Russian project.
However, this at the expense of reducing European energy, as the project has caused a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has managed to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are coming to an end.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed Francois Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the large gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the many Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin with regard to the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater line is made of steel with concrete coating, which it is to protect against ship attachments.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 metres.
During their construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be evaded.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for granted," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long snake made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from seeing the Swedes were little eager to see a Russian state company permanently located at the height of its coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be only slightly likely, since the sweats were estimated to be a durability of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot, which is controlled from a ocean-boat for external observation purposes, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a meter in diameter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal on arrival.
The gas pipe was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the leadership remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is commissioned with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on an extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transport of gas is," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of gas transmission construction was secured to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are certain to bring their expenses back in, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline is exposed to a sandy coastline near Lubmin, wooded with pine trees from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style again.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent by candlelight with writing.
The notebook by Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its elastic band, the eiersal-coloured sides, aged like over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is commissioned with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an alther-fashionable production technique called Mole Skin (mole skin), which is designated a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for covers of upholstered benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has rekindled an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century. The icon of avant-garde artists was considered a icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now a trademark manager at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales will increase by 26% and establish themselves with 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine passes through the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of buyers, since the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded clients.
The small, Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs more than 100 people and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is familiar with the company's identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing need, which exists despite the upswing in the e-mails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exposition called "Detour (detour) ", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard print cover on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood how to diversify its products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer sleeves... The brand has the full range of articles.
A success that brings Neider to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers at such a high level?
About 19% of the disabled persons are looking for a job.
Today the"15 begins. Week of work for the disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average value: 19% against 9% of the unemployment level of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, said Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which hosts the "Week of Work for the Disabled"."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount to be done."
It must be said, however, that for the disabled unemployed, many obstacles continue to exist before they get a job.
The older ones more commonly hit: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher educational degree.
In the end, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work, and which "represent the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes which are certainly but slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendrere association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed said "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which was "overrepresented" by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually reduced".
The result is that, with more than 20 employees, private companies still have a long way to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in a 1987 law.
These latter, figures from 2008, point to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We are now nearing the 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization charged with collecting contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: The number of "fees payable" of "plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid in between 2007 and 2011, has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (from 606 to EUR 480 million).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc explained."
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the plants employ between 20 and 49 employees with disabilities, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employees 82%.
Hazard:"What happiness"
Even before the "Blue Tuesday evenings (8:45) were fore), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide their pleasure, which brought them the friendly match.
It would be too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden happily could have since completed peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had received nothing but praise about his person.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look ahead," assures the native Liller.
When it comes to the contrast between its portrayal in club and national puppy"It's a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille, I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, caused on Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without refraining from the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of 7, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to reinforce the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he presents.
"We have just crossed the way."
"Being allowed to play them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, echoed "pity" with good nature.
"The pride of being a gala match."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbor" - that France has become "a team again at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician can very well see the aircraft sharing with the blue (the French national team) ... towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will notice this at the upcoming games". The game against France involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the return game against Bosnia and Herzegovina (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the first leg, both teams had lacked the objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a lucky team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees itself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La SelecÃoo", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play, and to breach an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Considering the first leg (10-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the thing on the stamp that would have taken the pressure off her.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, since we have not scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be able to hit an audience that should also be at stake, even if the game was of course announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic, yet clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we can gain the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the European Championship 2012," however, put Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can already suffice for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we have not scored an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intended to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning in order to "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
