No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a motion to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced as part of an amendment to the criminal code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-Prime Minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the motion to reduce penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for signing an allegedly harmful deal with Russia to buy natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as the regime&#39;s political revenge, and the trial also raised suspicions in the West that the court was biased.
The motion to remove Section 365 from the penal code, on the basis of which the ex-Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its acceptance.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As is usual in this region, Islamists win the elections. The only question is which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary law of Sharīʿa, of which God now has a certain idea.
Libya would become a crime-free country, because for stealing you cut off your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any apostates will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of mutually feuding tribes will in future be united by the Koran.
In short - an order will prevail in Libya that would be hard to imagine in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively seen probably not the best and would hardly suit the mentioned Libyans a change.
Seen in this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters let the infidel dogs help them at all.
Their only excuse may be the fact that NATO&#39;s airstrikes were not directed by some American general, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of the dictator without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
This relieves the locals of one concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But will the mineral oil companies get the black gold at a ridiculous price even without an occupation?
Hardly, and so the West can finally rightly boast of its unselfishness when it comes to protecting human rights.
Unless the shari&#39;a representatives spoil it for them.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
A statistical storm low roared through Europe on Tuesday.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France are growing.
However, the bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but now also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany&#39;s GDP grew by 0.5% and France&#39;s by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously revised their data for the second quarter, in which Germany posted higher-than-expected growth (0.3% growth vs. 0.1% forecast), while France admitted a slight 0.1% decline (original information spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. The statistical office thus confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally calculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the euro zone and the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts&#39; expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
Yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
Czech government bond yields remain below 4% even as the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and are now celebrating their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a spirited goalkeeper Čech and a wonderful goal from Petr Jiráček, they won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
Thanks to the home team&#39;s weakness in finishing, a brilliant Čech&#39;s and the hero of the day Jiráček, the Czech selection was quite happy to win 1-0 in Montenegro and thus cashed in their ticket to the European Football Championship.
Also because of the Czech team&#39;s precise defensive play, they were only able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The unlucky players of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech team will be involved in the European Championships next year. It is also gratifying that domestic football will receive a bonus of around 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined tediously and so the game was mainly played around the middle line.
The home team didn&#39;t put any pressure on in the second half either and the long shots in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country&#39;s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country&#39;s core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the object on Tuesday at noon and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan University in Iran on Tuesday formed a living shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to show that they are prepared to protect their country&#39;s core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has by no means given up on its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon.
Also in Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at the entrance to the complex at noon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran&#39;s nuclear program as far as possible, the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan would also be the target from the center in Isfahan.
An obese child&#39;s menu: He doesn&#39;t eat breakfast and eats sausage for supper
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have a problem with being overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which a person grows up and the examples that surround him are for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as common as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had fries for supper the day before the awareness campaign under the motto &quot;Obesity is no coincidence&quot;.
In families with fat children, sport is not one of the favorite pastimes either, but this also applies to the majority of today&#39;s schoolchildren - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic were interviewed.
This was the second year of the &quot;Adiposity is no coincidence&quot; campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the Unilever company.
More than 12,000 students from the 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project so far.
Unhealthy food and a lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children who are overweight or even obese.
&quot;Only half of the children surveyed said, for example, that they eat five times a day in the form of breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-lunch-evening-dinner - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet,&quot; reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as the family&#39;s regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of schoolchildren&#39;s families have breakfast.
And - in most families everyone eats breakfast alone.
The worst thing was the finding that every tenth family does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that unhealthy fries are eaten much more often in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed play sports, less than half of their parents do so - namely only 15 percent.
Put together your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own menu based on appetite and opinion from the options offered.
&quot;What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of healthy eating.
Among her favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and of course desserts.
&quot;The great popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming,&quot; the final report of this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta just won ahead of poultry.
The children didn&#39;t like legumes at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes for lunch was also very low.
return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
&#39;In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the educational lecture &#39;Obesity is not an accident&#39;, in many cases there was a clear shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating,&#39; the project&#39;s findings state.
This was evident, for example, with the sweet sodas, where many children began to give preference to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire, the children also ticked poultry or fish as the main dish of the day much more often and were willing to eat fewer dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I bitched that it was a bit too much stuff to start with.
I had no idea what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how things work &quot;on the pitch&quot;.
It&#39;s about to get worse.
As the exam approaches, we have more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man is taking part in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And most of us are, after all.
Some have a neck that is too short, others have a too boyish figure without proper curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - big breasts, wide hips and small waist - in a pretty and form-fitting way without being overly provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really don&#39;t fit, you should have at least one piece made to measure.
You certainly won&#39;t regret it, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
A tailored skirt like this makes you feel a lot better than a ready-made skirt that keeps riding up and down, sticking out at the waist, etc.
Boyish figures, on the other hand, can afford to wear clothing with pleats, puffs, appliqués, embroidery, or ruffles.
With so much information and body types, I&#39;m glad I have a week to think it all through.
And yet I&#39;m afraid that given the homework I&#39;ve been given, it&#39;s almost impossible to do.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity for whom they should think of suitable outfits - daywear and evening wear.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the given star and its body type.
I&#39;m supposed to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria&#39;s Secret campaign.
Inside I&#39;m cheering because for me personally it&#39;s a lot better than wearing, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who seems to have put on a hundred pounds lately (okay, that&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration), or even them young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the items of clothing from magazines or look for them on the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the &quot;moodboard&quot;, as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should then be expressed.
Because it is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only dresses the models physically, but also designs the so-called product pages in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But that&#39;s only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
Filled with information about body types, the Saturday lecture was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skilled stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in many different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over jeans as usual, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he insisted.
But the advice I found most convenient was this: &quot;First, you must know the rules perfectly.&quot;
&quot;Only then can you hurt them,&quot; said Jakub.
I&#39;m finally realizing why we have to learn all these tenets of what goes with what and why, even though fashion journals often show very different things.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more variations of clothing than he actually photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (read ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo sometimes looks completely different in combination with other accessories than in reality.
So you have to take all this into account when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed to us that image and style sometimes account for half of the success.
All you have to do is look at Madonna, a not-so-brilliant singer whose image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
In the Czech Republic, people tend to be more reserved about the services of a stylist.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be a waste of money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look while doing it is secondary).
And if someone does let us style them, then we should reckon with the fact that he or she is very likely to force us into a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then all you have to do is google it to find out with certainty that the tabloids are writing that the celebrity in question has gained or lost weight again, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to think that a stylist only needs to focus on the fashion and then &quot;assemble&quot; the outfit.
Above all, his work requires him to communicate with the people he styles and he needs to be a shrewd psychologist.
Assess people without ingratiating yourself and stand by your opinion.
&quot;If some manager calls us to go through her closet and add nice pieces to it, we can&#39;t just clean out her whole closet and say - my God, that&#39;s horrible.&quot;
&quot;You have to find at least some commendable things to recommend what to wear with,&quot; says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what a so-called &quot;place bag&quot; must contain.
So a bag that you button up at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to such obvious things as scissors, a hair-removing roller or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist when photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips used to gather clothes at the back , if it&#39;s too big (pins or other clips are forbidden, so that the fabric doesn&#39;t get damaged) and of course sewing kit.
So that we don&#39;t just have to listen, but can also try out something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes underneath.
Even when taking photos in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the sole of a shoe, let alone the one outside.
Us o glued and glued we...
You can&#39;t even touch the shoes with the scissors to avoid damaging them.
So you have to be really clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my &quot;creation&quot; without qualification.
That skill isn&#39;t exactly my forte.
All of this was just a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has now become clear to me - dedicating yourself to styling at a professional level is not child&#39;s play.
V Need for Speed: &quot;The Run&quot; - the illegal race across America
review
The originally carefree trip turns into a routine trip for the early shift due to a series of completely avoidable, amateurish mistakes.
It was possible to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what&#39;s the point if obviously nobody wanted to do a bit more.
Even before it hit the counters, the new installment, subtitled &quot;The Run,&quot; raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the long-established &quot;Need for Speed&quot; game series into a new dimension, and in the playable demonstration examples he actually didn&#39;t seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitted passages where the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are already used to with NFS, in the end a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they&#39;re pretty decent arcade races, but overall the game is marred by some unnecessary bugs that have been present in this series for more or less a couple of years.
So these are actually no longer errors, but rather signs of an incomprehensibly incomprehensible laziness on the part of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, i.e. on the west coast, you get behind the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be held on a different route and that individual stages will take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don&#39;t get the impression for a moment that the game offers the same thing over and over again.
Some of the environments are also extremely nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth shattering.
But driving through the desert, through an autumnal landscape or high up through a snow-covered landscape is visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, atypical elements bring a bit of variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be extremely careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, the individual races are built in quite well one after the other.
Only a few, but enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against a stopwatch), then another personal duel with a single opponent awaits you.
And on top of that, the police get involved, who want to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the wagon.
It&#39;s more about certain interactive animations where Jack is running away from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (actually only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the matter, because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - in the context of the above, it is one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means, from today&#39;s point of view, it doesn&#39;t uproot any trees, but on the other hand you couldn&#39;t say it&#39;s bad.
If you&#39;re looking for realistic simulations, you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere.
But for action-packed racing, the driving model here still does it quite well, although you could find better ones among the competition.
Until then everything is fine.
Real problems only appear after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK
It&#39;s hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you don&#39;t have any idea how the car behaves practically before hitting any object, then obviously everything isn&#39;t right.
Typical example: when overtaking or driving past oncoming cars, you only &quot;grab&quot; the other car slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you skid and do wild pirouettes.
Or does the car go straight to the scrap heap.
Thanks to the restart system, that doesn&#39;t matter, but it&#39;s always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have a total loss or land far off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue on the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you&#39;ve exhausted them, everything starts all over again.
So the restarts are more of a tool in case something goes wrong, but it&#39;s better not to rely on them.
But sometimes even a restart doesn&#39;t help, so nothing else helps than learning the critical section from your head.
What is extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to drive through some corners in a very specific way, otherwise you just don&#39;t fit through.
Elsewhere, at the appropriate place, you always come across &quot;civilian&quot; cars in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the opponent in front of you can easily pass two oncoming cars, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to avoid them or brake.
And it doesn&#39;t matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that that situation is always right under your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
There are a few spots throughout the game where you get overtaken by the same opponent in the same place, again regardless of the timing.
The craziest thing is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you cross in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake you come hell or high water here.
And if he&#39;s in front of you, then of course he blocks your view, so that you start by driving your own car into clumps a few times.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the fun of the game.
And that&#39;s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining overall and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don&#39;t know where your head is anymore.
And in principle it doesn&#39;t matter what is &quot;to blame&quot; - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that there is no chance of boredom, or something completely different...
Changing cars during the races is also an unusual idea.
You shouldn&#39;t overlook the petrol stations along the route, because this is where you can change cars, although in most cases the car you have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are well suited for urban areas, powerful American sedans for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example on mountain serpentines.
The task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations that are known from the story - go hand in hand with the game story mode.
Here you can win not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and the story.
In order to advance to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: starting from the car, ending with the backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, this is linked to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares your own achieved results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible blunders is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (I don&#39;t care) where you race along the rails in the dark (I don&#39;t care).
On the speedometer you can see numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (I don&#39;t care), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and uncompromisingly crashes you.
In our editorial office, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout by the game designers or whether the authors think we are that stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that the refresh rate slows down in some exciting moments and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as broad a range of young audiences as possible, a soundtrack a lá &quot;something of everyone&quot; was created - but who buys a game like this just for the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game weren&#39;t belittled by the aforementioned totally unnecessary bugs, we could have said with heartfelt conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in years.
But the game looks kinda unfinished.
It&#39;s a blast in its own right, but be prepared for these bugs to stab you in the eye with the force of airport headlights.
Concert of the &quot;Students of the Velvet Revolution&quot; with singing ensembles from Charles University
For the third time now, the Festa Academica festival has combined World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, complete with a musical experience.
During the festival, around twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The main focus of the festival are the two concerts that will take place on November 17th.
&quot;Charles University has a big part in the festival.&quot;
&quot;Among the participants are also the choirs of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies, and the festival committee includes, among others, Rector Václav Hampl,&quot; said the head of the organizing team, Jakub Čaloun.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of professional school choirs, which will take place on November 17 from 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program includes the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička &quot;Celebration Jazz Mass&quot;.
In the evenings, in the gala halls of the People&#39;s House in Vinohrady, the concert &quot;Students of the Velvet Revolution&quot; (Studenty sametu) will be held, at which university choirs will also perform, including choirs from Charles University.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music of the highest quality to the public and to encourage creative collaboration between young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The entire event was under the patronage of Bohuslav Svoboda, the Mayor of Prague and Václav Hampl, the Rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place in Prague and Pardubice from November 16th to 20th.
In addition to festival concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happenings, matinees and other events.
Those interested can find detailed information on the festival website www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativism and Eurosceptics
&quot;The Lisbon Treaty has noticeably upset the balance between the individual institutions.&quot;
I didn&#39;t expect such a hard war to break out.&quot;
&quot;It will take five or six years for things to settle down and for everyone to get used to their new role,&quot; Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the law faculty quite sharply.
How seriously she takes the motto &quot;Understandable and open about Europe&quot; was shown in the first part of her presentation, in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU bodies and their mutual relationships in such a clear and understandable way that many a lecturer at the Faculty of Law of Charles University could have envied it.
Ms. Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
&quot;There was initial criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a gray civil servant who wasn&#39;t up to the role, but I have to say it took everyone&#39;s breath away how well he handled the matter.
&quot;He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, to have a clear idea of how the EU should proceed.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is that actually - the European Union? Which number should I call?&quot;, ie as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel
Ms. Vicenová also addressed the agenda by which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government during the presidency as a major negative, which badly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador, not only was the presidency quite hectic, but also the ensuing crisis, which has not yet been overcome.
And then the EU&#39;s seven-year budget still has to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and frugal budget, which sectors of the economy will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which less funding - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogan, with which she came to Brussels: &quot;Understandable about Europe&quot;.
&quot;If there&#39;s something I don&#39;t like, it&#39;s grayish abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, how am I supposed to know whether people in Brussels are really thinking up crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone actually wants to ban the Quargel.
She would also have liked to use EU soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who tend to see the negative rather than the positive side of things.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
&quot;Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakian is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says: &quot;Hey, why are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?&quot; and does it a pretty sour expression.
According to Ms. Vicenové, what the EU expects in the future will be tough rules for the budget policy of the member states.
She sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more realistic than a &quot;European federation&quot;.
&quot;We have here the eurozone countries and the non-eurozone countries.
&quot;We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of strengthened cooperation.&quot;
&quot;For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it should work together and those that don&#39;t want it should stand aside.&quot;
&#39;There will be more and more such institutions, ultimately leading to a strong &#39;multi-speed Europe&#39;,&#39; expects Ms Vicenová.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the whole EU must be discussed by all member states and not only by eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM&#39;s strategy, it would be the word &quot;longevity&quot;.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company even though a century has passed since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson senior.
He already had the slogan that countless world problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; thus became the trademark around which the life of the future giant was to revolve (and at the same time the title of the in-house magazine that IBM began publishing as early as 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
&quot;For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a century because it stayed true to its principles and didn&#39;t shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope to do even more in the next hundred years,&quot; said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company&#39;s current director, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
As early as the 1930s, Watson was providing social care for his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people were among the first American employees to have paid vacation, insurance from the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well thought-out reward system for the best innovators and dealers.
IBM&#39;s long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant at promoting talent from the start - IBM was one of the first companies in the world to abolish all forms of discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
Also in line with this anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan to replace Palmisan at the helm of IBM next year with a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, previously holding the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Her unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
&quot;From the start, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,&quot; said The Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company, it&#39;s a company that uses technology to help solve business problems,&quot; added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, there is a difference between just being present in the market and directly shaping it through that presence.
IBM - known in the States as &quot;Big Blue&quot; because of its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes and the floppy disk.
At approximately $220 billion in stock market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second largest technology company this year (right after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today&#39;s customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with the company&#39;s own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
&quot;Business is based on moving forward, so don&#39;t get emotionally attached to the past,&quot; says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That&#39;s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and when they don&#39;t work, leaving them again.
In contrast to the competitor Microsoft, who in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising Technologies
Services contribute the most to IBM&#39;s profits, with software and hardware each accounting for one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still the strongest with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has divested $15 billion of low-yielding assets while investing $58 billion in acquisitions of promising technologies.
IBM continues to make these investments after 2008, when the modern financial crisis first hit the world like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment scope in the middle of the Great Depression.
So far it seems that the IBM company will survive today&#39;s crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM stock has skyrocketed 120 percent since 2008, and the company&#39;s net income continues to grow.
IBM&#39;s corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - except the values.
This is another reason why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flight
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It only took over the IBM name in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later IBM company was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They had technologies such as the famous time card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the board of directors until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired the head of rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help run the company.
This leader even eclipsed the founders of IBM - the company&#39;s invincible culture and identity is still based on Watson&#39;s ideas today.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the manufacture and sale of all kinds of machines for retail - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson ran the company, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to every continent.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in charge for forty years before being succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped NASA guide flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and, in 1969, man&#39;s famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which defined the computer standard of the time, came onto the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thereby fully entered the business of consulting and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the &quot;Smarter Planet&quot; concept.
It embodies the intention of using technology wisely in areas that have not even been planned before, including improving the situation in transport and city management.
In the commerce sector, IBM recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform, designed to help merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932 IBM founded a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - as the very first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR operates, among other things, a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague, and it is also home to a world-class, top-class research team working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don&#39;t want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - it&#39;s over now!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) changed from protector to Iveta Bartošová (45) to her lover, Darina still had hope that Josef would wake up from his rosy dream and come home.
But now her patience is finally over and she has set herself clear rules for the rest of her life.
&quot;Josef can come home, but not more than my partner,&quot; explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered shelter to the singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she probably never would have dreamed how things would turn out with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Josef went with her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved her.
Over time, Darina gave up, it even seemed as if she wanted to be reconciled with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally dumped him.
Rychytář doesn&#39;t care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář should leave Iveta Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not be welcomed with open arms at home.
&quot;He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our home together I will not chase him out.&quot;
&quot;However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties,&quot; reveals Ms. Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already broken up with him emotionally and insists on mutual decency alone.
So far, Josef bears the fact that Darina locked his back door with dignity.
&quot;I respect my wife&#39;s decision.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll stay with Iveta, nothing will change that.&quot;
&quot;My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company keeps going, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping.&quot;
&quot;I talk to Darina quite normally, we just don&#39;t share the bed,&quot; said J. Rychtář (the newspaper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he doesn&#39;t want to stop her.
&quot;We don&#39;t sleep together so I don&#39;t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
Worst Feminine Virtues: How About You?
If you ask the men to name a few typical female vices, they invariably come up with a few straight away.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few bad habits that make men&#39;s blood rush?
shopping addiction
Does your husband accuse you of being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one Hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more with special offers?
Then in your case it really is about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping urge under control.
But honestly, which woman can stand to just stroll through a clothing store looking for well-fitting outerwear and not try them all (in all possible color combinations) in the dressing room?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, it is often pure hell for men.
Think about how many times you&#39;ve said to your husband - you&#39;d better stay outside...
constant dissatisfaction
&quot;Am I not too fat?&quot;
&quot;I should lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?&quot;
&quot;Do you like me at all?&quot;
Does that sound familiar to you?
Yes?
Then you must be one of those women who are downright obsessed with how they look.
That doesn&#39;t mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wives constantly whine about their looks.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are more and more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness come first
It&#39;s a battle against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Scold your partner because he&#39;s trampling on the clean tiles with his dirty shoes, scold the children because the washbasin you just scrubbed is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cupboard has fingerprints again, when polishing it takes so much effort might?
If you suffer from this kind of &quot;deviance&quot;, then you should know that you shouldn&#39;t overdo it and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the top priority.
Ultimately, this excessive obsession with purity can also damage mutual relationships and, above all, the peace and quiet in the family.
tease
&quot;Dirty gym shorts go in the laundry basket.&quot;
&quot;Are you sure you want to put those old socks back on tomorrow?&quot;
&quot;You don&#39;t just throw a wet towel on the floor.&quot;
When your partner is subjected to such a tirade, don&#39;t be surprised that it drives them nuts.
Of course, that&#39;s not meant badly, they just want everything to be in order.
If men knew this, then women might not have to complain so much.
gossip
Some women like to gossip, there is whispering or even slander behind their backs or alliances are forged.
Women are relationship-focused, so they like to pant through topics like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip up our sleeves.
Hand on heart - that is probably all women own.
However, this is not to be confused with gossips of the coarsest caliber, for whom nothing and nobody is sacred, who probably despise everyone around them and who represent a considerable danger, especially for women collectives.
Jágr and Voráček assisted Philadelphia to the win
Ice hockey forward Jaromír Jágr played two assists in Philadelphia&#39;s 5-3 win on the Carolina ice in Monday&#39;s NHL game, making him once again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, the beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Jágr&#39;s team-mate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assists in the same game.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he predicted a big night for Giroux.
&quot;I tell him before the game that he will score a hat-trick today.&quot;
I kind of felt that.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes you get that feeling,&quot; said Jágr, whose action allowed Giroux to score on the Flyers&#39; first shot.
A little later, the second goal also had &quot;a Czech touch&quot;.
Voráček won the puck behind the Hurricanes&#39; goal and put it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the end of the first period, home player Patrick Dwyer hit a short-hander, but the second period then belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
Working with Jágr, he scored his third goal before Wayne Simmonds deflected his shot for the fourth.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I won&#39;t say he&#39;s the best player in the league, but he&#39;s definitely in the top three,&quot; Jágr said of his center.
&quot;It would never have occurred to me in my life that I would play with such a hockey player at the end of my career as he did.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m really happy about that.&quot;
&quot;I tailor my game to me.&quot;
&quot;All my years in the NHL, my teammates adjusted their game to me and now the tables are turning,&quot; said Jágr with a smile.
Carolina added drama to the game - goals from Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who won from a penalty shot, brought the game close to a goal.
However, Matt Read prevented any further complications by winning two against one with a majority.
&quot;Pronger acted excellently in our zone.&quot;
&quot;He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to the far post.&quot;
&quot;I tried to hit him and I&#39;m glad it worked,&quot; Voráček described the last goal of the game from his point of view.
This victory placed Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second period with a torso injury.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in a penalty shoot-out 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec was unable to convert one of the penalty shots.
The coach of the home team was hurt more than the lost points by the high number of defensive absences due to illness - they only played the game with five defenders to the end.
&quot;This is bad.&quot;
&quot;We finished the match with just one experienced player, the rest were young players.&quot;
&quot;But there&#39;s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Every time there was a change, there was a wave of attacks and we couldn&#39;t do anything about it.&quot;
&quot;We should have made the game easier and got the puck out of our third.&quot;
There were reserves here,&quot; said PK Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec saved thirty shots from Tampa Bay to help win the game 5-2 over Winnipeg.
Five different shooters contributed to the Jets&#39; goals, which ended a five-game losing streak.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five licensed state travel agencies in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies mainly only sold trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, only a select few were allowed to go to the West.
And so, Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and to Hungary to Lake Balaton.
A notable exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
If a Czech citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or even the Soviet Union, for example, they needed a so-called letter of invitation, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to put up with huge queues or spend the night in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel agency.
Things hadn&#39;t gone that way for a long time either.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for leaving for the West - was only given to &quot;politically reliable&quot; people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachas - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the obligation to exchange foreign currency in neighboring Western European countries was lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time, the Czechoslovaks simply couldn&#39;t get enough of their trips to the West, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
Czech vacationers, for example, slept in tents in parks when traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money for hotel or boarding house accommodation back then?
A typical feature of Czechs traveling abroad at that time was a trunk packed with canned goods, beer and sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech koruna - after decades, our tourists could finally buy the western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thereby also the average salary increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
After 1997, thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly arrange trips through charter flights, which made air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already had non-currency payments with all highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of &quot;post-velvet&quot; travel came in 2000, when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - Thailand - was operated.
Since then, direct charter planes with Czech passengers have flown to distant, sunny countries every year; this year twelve exotic destinations will be flown to directly from the Czech Republic.
Around 100,000 Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our &quot;post-revolutionary&quot; development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visa requirements for Czech tourists, which definitely put our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, Czechs spent more than half of their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than CZK 15,000 per capita on a single vacation including costs at the vacation destination.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate is imminent.
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and threatens that Ivan Hašek&#39;s successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after Thursday&#39;s extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk.
To this day, there is still no agreement on which electoral regulations should be used.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three prospects want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his post in June, urging his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two association chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was made crystal clear on September 16, when the new chairman was about to be chosen.
The delegates of the general meeting had come to the People&#39;s House in Prague&#39;s Smíchov district for nothing, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law contributed, according to which representation on the basis of a power of attorney was not permissible.
However, disputes over the electoral regulations continue.
The Executive Committee did not bring more clarity to the matter either, at whose meetings - regardless of whether they are ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if opinions regarding the election changed a few times, the critical point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a stalemate?
&quot;The point of contention is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model needs to be found,&quot; said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three FAČR vice-presidents, who represents professional football on the management board.
According to the statutory model, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins the third round.
Moravia is said to be ready to accept a compromise in which the candidate with the highest number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
&quot;Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept,&quot; Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral regulations, but to vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even if it is becoming apparent that the statutory election regulations are most likely to suit Pelta of all the candidates.
&quot;My wish is that elections are largely based on the statutes.&quot;
&quot;So that no nonsensical substitute variants are thought up, as was the case at the last general meeting,&quot; explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements distanced himself from Pelta in particular.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
&quot;The possibility of the national team qualifying for the European Football Championship today would certainly help calm things down.&quot;
&quot;When football first rides the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater,&quot; says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
&quot;I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambiguous.&quot;
&quot;This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to &#39;bend&#39; the regulations for their own purposes.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, another blocking at the general meeting cannot be ruled out.&quot;
&quot;I hope, however, that common sense will prevail in the end,&quot; said Rajchl.
Except that there is not much time left for all sides to agree.
Some negotiations were rumored to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will even be complete by the time of the qualifier.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were supposed to fly to Podgorice, could not take off from Prague in the morning due to a technical problem and so a feverish search was made for a replacement variant, how to get part of the Executive Committee to the Barrage venue - to bring the first leg.
Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is decisive.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Schools, Youth and Physical Education would have liked to move the divided parties within the country&#39;s largest sports federation to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and the forthcoming ČSTV general meeting, which should show Czech sport a new direction after the financial problems in Sazka.
Paclík is going into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen football team, could have identified a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) before the extraordinary general meeting, he would not have bothered to fight for this top position at all admitted.
&quot;If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and not vote.&quot;
&quot;But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept,&quot; Paclík told ČTK.
So the main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of choice, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that if he wins, he intends to serve as chairman for only one year, that is, until 2013, by the time of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
&quot;I have personally spoken to some of the people who might be interested.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s hard to believe that some people told me they didn&#39;t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
&quot;Such views would have liked to change,&quot; he said.
Most of all, Paclík is said to be disturbed by Pelta&#39;s association with Pilsen District Football Association chairman Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is said to be a powerful behind-the-scenes lobbyist with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
&quot;If he were to win it would be like it is today and Czech football would not progress at all.&quot;
&quot;The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football,&quot; stressed Paclík.
He is also alluding to the fact that Pelta&#39;s name was mentioned some time ago in connection with phone tapping to investigate a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged unpunished.
&quot;I don&#39;t know what prestige a Pelta win should bring to (cz.) football.&quot;
&quot;And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said řekl Paclík, who takes a more relaxed view of his earlier statement that &quot;he will sell the Pilsen football club if Pelta becomes chairman&quot;.
However, should Paclík win Thursday&#39;s election, he could definitely imagine working with Pelta in the future.
Another candidate thinks the same way - Rajchl, whom Paclík supported ahead of the October shareholders&#39; meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first I would go to.&quot;
&quot;He has great skills&quot;.
&quot;I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example.&quot;
&quot;But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s capable of running the association as a manager.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t stick my nose into things I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Paclík, who caused a stir in September for being behind the dismissal of the Referees Committee with Luďěk Macela at the helm, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels up to the role of association chairman.
And refers to his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which celebrated its first triumph in the league with his support in May.
&quot;I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of it.&quot;
&quot;To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which degenerates into ugly situations,&quot; said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy towards Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský, for example.
He said one of his priorities would be to strengthen ties between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which he would use to lobby political leaders for more lottery tax money to flow into sport.
&quot;This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should address.&quot;
&quot;If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties are saying, then I understand their reasoning, but then they also need to be very clear about where the money is going,&quot; he said.
Paclík does not see his connection to the Pilsner club as a handicap either, although he himself stresses that the FAČR chairman must be &quot;non-partisan&quot;.
Pelta, in turn, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
&quot;It&#39;s not exactly ideal.&quot;
&quot;In my opinion, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsen club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half,&quot; Paclík clarified.
Pelta promised new FAČR statutes that would rule out a future stalemate.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would campaign for the FAČR to have new statutes that would rule out future disputes about the election rules from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is optimistic ahead of Thursday&#39;s hearings in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly calm down if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the failed election in September that if elected he would concentrate on the national team and raising funds.
He only decided at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break may help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
&quot;People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday.&quot;
&quot;He feels it&#39;s high time the association was led by someone,&quot; says the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who also spent many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
That&#39;s one of the reasons why he thinks he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election are due to the euphoria that prevailed in Ivan Hašek&#39;s time.
&quot;Unfortunately, the June AGM approved articles of incorporation that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn&#39;t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September,&quot; said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens&#39; association as a lure for the delegates.
&quot;Should I become chairman, then I&#39;ll take care of it personally and I&#39;m willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn&#39;t work out.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a principle thing he can&#39;t be without,&quot; claims Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to differentiate himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he respects for his legal education and knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He hasn&#39;t attacked Tomáš Paclík for a long time either, who in turn didn&#39;t leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He&#39;s been in football for over a year and can already point to certain successes.&quot;
&quot;However, his attacks were derogatory and many people were shocked by his campaign.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s also why many are now doubting his real character,&quot; Pelta addressed his opponent, who is likely to remain true to the proclamations he made back in September.
In his opinion, his greatest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest leagues to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
&quot;I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Bohemians cause to the reverberations of last year&#39;s corruption scandal.&quot;
&quot;Right after that I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure sufficient funding for all football,&quot; 46-year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his rise to the top of Czech football would not mean any personnel purges.
&quot;First of all, I would have to familiarize myself with the job content of all employees,&quot; he said in direction to Strahov, where understandably nervousness prevails due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
&quot;If really the only point of contention is how to vote in the third round, then we can get over that.&quot;
&quot;Football needs credibility and it will only regain that when it finally has a new leader,&quot; Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that FAČR will start working hard under him
If former deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at Thursday&#39;s general meeting, it would reportedly upset many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, they will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make Executive Committee members accountable for individual areas of football.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
&quot;As chairman, I want to devote myself to football as a whole.&quot;
Starting with the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to competitive football for young people.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not saying that I want to do everything on my own,&quot; Rajchl told ČTK.
&quot;I&#39;m a team player, so I&#39;d like to spread the responsibilities of the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area.&quot;
And I&#39;m going to hand out tough tasks so that football progresses by mile increments in each segment.&quot;
A lot of people wouldn&#39;t be happy about that because instead of just criticizing the work of others, she would have to start working really hard herself,&quot; he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I considered not running at all.
&quot;I&#39;ve been known to work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who aren&#39;t constantly throwing a spanner in the works and questioning every step I take,&quot; he said, explaining why he hesitated.
&quot;But a lot of people told me that I shouldn&#39;t give up because otherwise others would too.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s trust that you can&#39;t gamble away,&quot; he said.
Supposedly, being able to continue the work he started under Hašek also motivates him.
&quot;We&#39;ve done a lot of work in two years and I don&#39;t want to just throw it away.&quot;
&quot;Processes have been started that will probably not come into effect for a couple of years and I would hate to see anyone stop them,&quot; he said, expressing concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
&quot;I believe in systematic approach and that&#39;s something Mirek Pelta doesn&#39;t bring.&quot;
&quot;Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that it would only be there for a select few.&quot;
You can accuse me of some things, but not that I&#39;m biased.&quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want football for everyone because then everyone is happy and not just the chosen few,&quot; remarked Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a leader of the Czechs.
&quot;Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it&#39;s time to think about dividing the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then move up to the first division.&quot;
&quot;Then it couldn&#39;t happen that there are only three Moravian clubs in the league today, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia,&quot; said Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the fight for the post of chairman, Rajchl doesn&#39;t dare to assess his chances of being elected.
&quot;I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chair and now recognizes that I have clear achievements behind me,&quot; said Rajchl, who also said the agreement would save tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts television contracts and the lottery law negotiations as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull together.
While he says of Pelta &quot;he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football regain confidence&quot;, he believes second rival - Paclík - to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
&quot;No one can question that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year.&quot;
&quot;If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the composition of the commissions either.&quot;
He certainly wouldn&#39;t want to bend things in his favor,&quot; Rajchl said of his rival.
Europe&#39;s most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in the shape of a UFO, ceremonial pools in Budapest: anyone traveling through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and rest their tired legs in whirlpool baths after a city tour or a hike.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, one thing she couldn&#39;t do without was her swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked up at the artistically designed domes, she swam towards marble putti waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bathroom, she immediately jotted it down in her notebook - along with details worth knowing about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and is now presenting them in her recently published book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: public swimming pools in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, &quot;hardcore concrete buildings&quot; in the Taunus.
Her &quot;journey to the most extraordinary pools in Central Europe&quot; took her through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn&#39;t have much to do with sports, says Meder - it&#39;s just different in the water.
It&#39;s just annoying that swimmers have to put up with blue tiles and the stench of chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the happy chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;One day I asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,&quot; says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
&quot;So I started collecting beautiful baths.&quot;
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, says Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, indoor swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor, bathrooms have a water surface.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format photo book &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides 190 pages worth knowing about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oases - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-rich body of water in a quaint karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and housed in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jaszbereny).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can see the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool of a pool in St. Anton - and: there is a window in the steam bath , from which you can watch the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it steams from three bowls that are open at the top, while the mountains of the Ötztal tower into the sky in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Pool collector Meder did not catch the smell of chlorine in every swimming pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, it stinks so strongly of heating oil that you hardly believe you have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline-bicarbonate healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a special kind of wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech spa in Luhatschowitz, she found a closed-off area.
The bath, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has since been closed.
Peering through the weathered windows of the red, white, and yellow Art Nouveau building, Meder saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the deterioration has been counteracted in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This pool has already completed three construction phases; Not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements dating back to when it was built in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Moorish hall, added around 1900.
Since it was carefully modernized in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she originally comes from the Black Forest.
&quot;It&#39;s quite an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit,&quot; says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank has its commodities business screened
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank going out of business with soft commodities?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
The matter is clear for German citizens: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate in agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed are even calling for Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to get out of this business because it aggravates the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and that the banks are therefore partly to blame for the global hunger problem.
The campaign by consumer advocates is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar way.
Commodity bets were originally intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the gamblers have decoupled themselves from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike its US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no deal was &quot;worth jeopardizing Deutsche Bank&#39;s good reputation&quot;.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations made in the Foodwatch report.
The test should be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank&#39;s board of directors - along with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to announce the consequences it is drawing.
In the end there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann is tinkering with his image
Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: &quot;The bets on rising food prices show particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are damaging the common good today.&quot;
As the top bank lobbyist, Ackermann now has a special duty.
&quot;Deutsche Bank must eliminate all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices,&quot; Bode said.
&quot;Regardless of whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or with the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Ackermann&#39;s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not move to the supervisory board, contrary to what had been planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to worry about possible losses - after all, his successor would have to do with that.
One in two would quit commodity investments
Foodwatch tries to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have taken part in the organization&#39;s campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on November 7th and 8th.
Just eleven percent consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments in which food prices are bet on.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: According to the survey, every second customer would terminate all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about closing their account and switching to another institute.
21 house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural story with ups, downs and a happy ending: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and fell into disrepair.
Now it will be reopened as an exhibition hall.
If people rave about modern post-war architecture, about clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwartzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is a fitting and famous example .
Back then, Schwacher&#39;s pavilion received the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture for its light steel and glass construction, which appears to be floating.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria&#39;s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
He finally became internationally famous in 1973 with his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annexe in Munich.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden near Vienna&#39;s southern railway station, remodeled and opened in 1962 as a museum of the 20th century - it was called the &quot;20er Haus&quot;.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art found a new home in Vienna.
The building had been empty since 2001 and was gradually falling into disrepair.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called &quot;21er Haus&quot; and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the building belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, pushed through the new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, who has a doctorate in art history and had a remarkable career, including in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, pushed through the conversion with politicians and monument conservationists, she raised public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the usage.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the implementation.
Not only because he had sensitively remodeled and expanded Joseph Olbrich&#39;s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied under Schwacher at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an &quot;incredibly important place&quot; for him, where he &quot; almost every weekend&quot; had seen the exhibitions.
He knew the original design and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and repurposed.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was &quot;an energy slingshot,&quot; says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced with special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two basement floors provided space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides the light, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light-weight tail-pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain and the house is painted in the old reddish-brown anti-rust colour.
And the cinema hall is even exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
&quot;Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and that the monument protection office also liked,&quot; says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion &quot;that came from Brussels,&quot; Krischanitz said recently, a typical &quot;drop-in-the-city thing.&quot;
Such architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;raise a real awareness&quot;.
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban stroke of luck has occurred: around the Schweizer Garten, the completely newly planned &quot;Hauptbahnhofsquartier&quot; is being built, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may yet happen: The 21er Haus could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as has been heard, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans winter crisis package worth millions
The railway has worked out a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train cancellations and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal group crisis plan, that investments totaling around 300 million euros are planned by 2015.
This is intended to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network even in extreme weather.
Among other things, the plan is to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice before the start of operations and 90 percent of the points required for operations within four to five hours.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn boss Rüdiger Grube warned of train cancellations and delays again this winter.
Last winter, the railways had significant problems in passenger transport, as they lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railway Authority for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been struggling for years because it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked in the workshop much more frequently after an ICE broke an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the USA
After the tumult surrounding boss Josef Ackermann, new adversity comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine of millions there.
As if the problems at home weren&#39;t enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant&#39;s past in the USA is now catching up: The Frankfurt institute is paying $145 million (106 million euros) in a settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It&#39;s about selling mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of having misled the cooperative banks into buying financial products with false promises; they downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down with it.
&quot;We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,&quot; said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the settlement.
So did Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) oversees the US credit unions and steps in when they go bankrupt to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to recover the billions in damage that has been caused.
The settlements that have now been reached are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken on other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it was fatal for a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events happened a few years ago, a sharp wind is currently blowing against the banks in the USA.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits seeking redress or to punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has unleashed the largest wave of lawsuits.
She accuses 18 major international banks of cheating the two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions with a volume of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a lawsuit from the FHFA over multiple deals totaling $14.2 billion from 2005-2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurter be responsible for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, without naming an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to fight back.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IT company IBM.
He has bought more than $10 billion worth of stock since March.
Up until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always stated that he would not invest in IT and computer companies because it was difficult to forecast the long-term development of the company.
However, he has now read IBM&#39;s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered an accolade in the financial world.
As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself &quot;Sir IBM&quot;.
Because Buffett has now revealed on the US business channel CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $ 10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM&#39;s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM was aware of the commitment until now.
He praised the management, which had made decent profits even during the economic crisis.
&quot;They did a great job,&quot; Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as high-performance company computers.
Buffett had previously avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett grabbed something from a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
In addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, his holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a whole range of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with clever investments, turned it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Still, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money has earned him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha&quot;.
After the Buffett investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent premarket.
&quot;Big Blue&quot;, as IBM is also known, is worth a total of more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett said he didn&#39;t want to get involved with Microsoft.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is palpable
After the &quot;Zwickau cell&quot; was uncovered, the Turkish media questioned the rule of law in Germany.
A newspaper even speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small business owners of Turkish origin and one small business owner from Greece between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German-Turks, a specter long thought dead is returning: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has not been comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, there was never any question that there is xenophobia in Germany.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimensions are far from foreseeable.
&quot;Is the bloody ideology reviving?&quot; was the title of the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot;, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been an informant from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing morass.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted calmly: they commemorated the victims of racist violence at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Just two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had held a ceremony to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
The togetherness was staged in cheerful colors - as a story of success.
The reporting by some Turkish media comes across as a slap in the face: &quot;Germany&#39;s fiftieth birthday present&quot; is the headline of an article on the Turkish Internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, which reports on the background to the series of murders.
The German edition of &quot;Hürriyet&quot; also insists on making this mental connection.
&quot;It&#39;s starting to stink,&quot; is the title of Ahmet Külahci&#39;s column.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and who made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work were murdered.
The actions of the police and their subsequent success in the search are discussed extremely critically in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wonder why the German authorities didn&#39;t think of it much earlier to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically willing to take drastic measures: &quot;If the sloppiness continues here, the migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves and take up arms.&quot;
&quot;That will probably be the best self-protection&quot;.
&quot;The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the quality of the investigation and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network,&quot; writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
The attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s made clear what it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger.
The photo of the burnt ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the sense of unity on the Turkish side.
Don&#39;t repeat past mistakes
At the time, the Turkish press mainly criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but had his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel represent him at the funeral service in Cologne. In his speech at the time, Kinkel listed how many taxes the local Turks made.
Just as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting in the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German-Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and reassessment of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank from Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German should fix it.
Axel Weber certainly hadn&#39;t thought of it that way.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity, and dropping friendly remarks about future colleagues.
&quot;UBS has managed the turnaround&quot;.
&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel&quot;.
But as early as September it became clear that everything would turn out very differently.
A UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank&#39;s security systems and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered ailing - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It will be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed an induction period.
In one fell swoop, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title of &quot;biggest scandalous bank in Europe.&quot;
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest wealth manager in the world - and on the other hand it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: She also wanted to be a big hit in investment banking.
In 2007, for example, UBS managed more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world, at $1.6 trillion.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later longtime banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: &quot;Back then, I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;From today&#39;s point of view one asks oneself: How could I be so wrong?&quot;
He was terribly wrong.
In 2007 it became apparent for the first time that something was seriously wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later you could guess why he had left.
The bank&#39;s investment division had gambled away with subprime paper and had to write off billions.
To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital increase of a whopping CHF 13 billion.
She actually found investors for this, albeit ones that some would have turned up their noses at a short time ago: an opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive that you didn&#39;t even find out its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 things got worse.
The bank had to announce new losses in the billions, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who in 2006 was still the second-best paid member of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned.
The catastrophe followed in October 2008: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its bad investments during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because they noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such large banks.
After all, UBS&#39;s balance sheet total in 2007 was more than five times the size of Switzerland&#39;s economic output (see chart).
&quot;We couldn&#39;t save UBS again,&quot; says bank researcher Geiger.
The second catastrophe followed the first.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty surcharge.
UBS thus admitted more or less openly that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her asset in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was never the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the CEO and President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both of its central business areas: in investment banking due to the bad speculations and in asset management due to the help to tax evasion.
And just when things got a little quieter again, just when you thought UBS would get it right again, this unfortunate trader story follows: A single trader gambles away 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it&#39;s becoming obvious that risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
&quot;With the Adoboli case, one had to realize that risk control had changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: &quot;UBS&#39;s problem is that it doesn&#39;t have risk control under control.&quot;
It was precisely the idea of prudence with which the Swiss bankers set out a long time ago to become the guardians of the great fortunes of the world: no great risks, but security for the money - even if the world collapsed beyond the Alpine republic .
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, just like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it&#39;s just a bit bigger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich&#39;s Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main train station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany&#39;s can be found here between traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The UBS reception room is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are clad in marble, thick leather armchairs stand in front of them, and next to the bank logo is a large sign indicating the &quot;safe&quot;.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, eventually suppressed this idea of the Swiss bank - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank thinks, betrayed it.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
He thinks that UBS has become much too big - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss would no longer have a say there.
&quot;And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first bringing it high profits and then the debacle: no other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
&quot;On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;The UBS Crash&quot;.
The politicians approved up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for little Switzerland when it merged - and it continued to grow.
It helped that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of cheap money with which to spin a giant wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,&quot; says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut person, who worked his way up from the bank apprenticeship to the very top.&quot;
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: &quot;He thought his models were reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;This is a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the management meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: push Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the &quot;League Tables&quot;, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That&#39;s where UBS wanted to go, to the top.
She had already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
Management consultants who were commissioned, however, emphasized a weakness: In the international interest business, in banker&#39;s language &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund established before it invested in American subprime investments.
It grew into a mighty machine that packaged and passed securities on American mortgage loans—while also retaining risk itself.
Even when other banks were already looking to exit.
&quot;UBS was still buying there in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames,&quot; says banking expert Geiger.
As great as the euphoria, as deep as the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up proved more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS became an ejection seat and remain shaky to this day.
Anyone who runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to your Swiss roots.
The bank doesn&#39;t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is set to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: he should permanently manage the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to take the investment bank back to where it was in the mid-1990s.
He is cutting 3,500 jobs.
But that won&#39;t be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is certainly already asking himself.
So far he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The looming recession in Europe discouraged US investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Reduced industrial production on the continent nipped hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief about the change of government in Rome and Athens did not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
In the past week, the Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full, not half empty - but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial stocks in particular were on the sales slips.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones index of standard values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&amp;P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down 1 percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and ended trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has reduced its production significantly and is preparing for the end of the upswing.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, according to the statistics office Eurostat.
That made US investors skeptical: &quot;We&#39;re not an island, we&#39;re dependent,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession that quickly, and there are also further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett ditched a decades-old principle and entered the US tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and initially made it almost one percent higher, bucking the trend in trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $ 187.35.
Buffett says he paid an average of $170 a share and now owns 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, significantly more than the market.
The house sold almost all of the rest of its stake in China Construction Bank for $6.6 billion.
Above all, the institute wants to use the net profit from the business to pad its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
Aircraft maker Boeing rallied, limiting losses in the Dow.
The share gained 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and put the value of the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 additional machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
Around 710 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
719 values rose, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, 630 shares closed up, 1913 down and 82 flat on sales of 1.38 billion shares.
Intelligent crows are spreading throughout cities
In many places, rooks are seen as &quot;problem birds&quot;: But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many communities there are increasing numbers of complaints from residents about the animals&#39; dirt and noise.
A remedy for the &quot;problem birds&quot; is not yet in sight.
Experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer that rooks can no longer be gotten out of the cities.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
They are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the specially protected rookers: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing building and the felling of typical nesting trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest in Westphalia, in the north-west in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district made negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and beating them with clubs as particularly brutal.
&quot;The normal expulsion, the scaring away, brings nothing,&quot; said urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Splashing away nests with water or cutting down trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;The animals evade, large colonies split up and spread to other places.&quot;
Deterrence is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
&quot;We have to live with them, we can&#39;t get rid of them.&quot;
The problem in the cities cannot be solved without the surrounding area, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of deterring the animals from sensitive living areas and offering lures to resettle them in other places is conceivable.
&quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws,&quot; the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advocated a completely different approach to animals: &quot;After all, we&#39;re best able to face a pimple on our face with confidence.&quot;
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberg crows educational trail, where signs provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rooks.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: &quot;There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other.&quot;
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: rooks not only use tools to get a treat, they even use tools to make their own tools.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four rooks to see how far the birds&#39; intelligence reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to use stones to break down scaffolding in order to get at a moth larva.
Without much training, they single-mindedly recognized what size and shape a stone needs to be in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a trickier problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire down for them.
All four animals used this to form a hook, which they then used to fish the bucket out of the tube by the handle.
Three of the four rooks even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to Euro 2012
The Bosnians and the Turks had no hopes of a coup.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets for the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the doubly successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and after the 0-0 in the first leg made the fifth European Championship participation perfect.
In the second leg of the play-off, the Czechs drew 1-0 (0-0) against outsiders Montenegro, after the first leg (2-0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also didn&#39;t miss a beat in the 0-0 draw against Turkey, while Ireland won an easy 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24&#39;), Helder Postiga (72&#39;, 82&#39;) and Miguel Veloso (80&#39;) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted hand penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already lost to Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a great start.
Ronaldo fired in a free-kick from around 30 yards out for an early lead.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range shooting qualities and scored from 25 meters to make it 2-0.
Missing for the first half hour, the Bosnians had their first clear chance through goalscorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player from English leaders Manchester City headed the underside of the bar, but the ball did not go over the goal line (33&#39;).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding took center stage.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese a yellow card (36&#39;).
On the other side, Stark gave a controversial hand penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely converted.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice Champion made everything clear with four goals.
Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row that the 1976 European champion is going to the European Championships.
The team coached by Michal Bilek, with Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg), was lucky and had to endure a moment of shock in the early stages.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic was in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic fired just wide of Cech&#39;s goal from a turn from the edge of the penalty area.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, the FC Seoul striker had shot again (50th).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not get more than 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink will almost certainly have to vacate his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup bronze medalist, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship finals.
The Turks almost got off to a dream start in front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium.
Selcuk Inan hit the post with a long-range shot in the seventh minute, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to put the rebound into the goal.
After the moment of shock, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn&#39;t miss a beat.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made room for Ivan Perisic from Dortmund in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward put coach Giovanni Trapattoni&#39;s side, who had already secured a 4-0 win in the first leg, ahead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start but had to wait until 23 minutes before Los Angeles Galaxy&#39;s Robbie Keane had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back line prevent a possible opening goal.
In the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was there and pushed the ball over the line to make it 1-0.

The Labrador probably jumped on the stove to get food, police said on Friday.
He must have moved the switch and turned on a record.
Paper on the stove caught fire.
The apartment on the fourth floor of an apartment building caught fire on Thursday afternoon.
The dog died from smoke inhalation.
The 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the apartment during the fire, is being investigated for negligent arson.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe&#39;s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are to flow by 2015, the Dax group announced on Tuesday.
&quot;We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,&quot; announced co-boss Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from the current 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are based in the booming country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group&#39;s Strategy 2015.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer had earned around 12.5 billion euros.
The software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is currently doing better than ever before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
&quot;Now we want to expand our activities (...) &quot;, explained McDermott.
&quot;Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.&quot;
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and magnanimous, Peter Englund&#39;s new book &quot;Beauty and Horror. A History of the First World War, Told in Nineteen Fates&quot; begins with a long list of main characters that touches one&#39;s heart.
Here&#39;s a tip on how to do it: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund&#39;s novel-like narrative. And these principals will act as your GPS, your beacon in those few moments when you, like Englund&#39;s men and women, are lost in the fog of war and bereft of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he not aptly describes as &quot;a work of anti-history&quot;.
It contains only a few big names, important treaties or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It&#39;s less a book about what happened, he explains, and more &quot;a book about how it was.&quot; It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods&quot;.
&quot;Beauty and Horror&quot; summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go insane, or die.
Each of these lives flares up like votive candles in a church, some coming in while others go out.
Englund&#39;s book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was just the devastating trench warfare on the western front.
&quot;Beauty and Horror&quot; wanders over other theaters of war with an expert&#39;s eye: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insurmountable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the start.
The war swamps the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of cordite.
Imagine you are a woman at home with her children and hear cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you flee?
Who is coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
&quot;Missing facts,&quot; notes Englund, &quot;have been bolstered with hunches, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumours.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Horror&quot; follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German seaman.
Their stories were mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
Their life stories can be terrifying or poignant, but they are intensely vivid in Englund&#39;s lost-detail collection of small moments.
Many of them are about lack and making do.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: &quot;Replacement, replacement everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Substitute coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
He tells more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes &quot;meat made from pressed rice and fried in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes soled with wood.&quot;
There were, he notes, &quot;837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot;
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American, recognizing his own thirst for savagery, says of the war: &quot;One feels that, after all, this is what men were meant for rather than sitting in an armchair with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, and to pretend that such a facade signifies civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one&#39;s starched and studded shirt-front.&quot;
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and that no one will notice or care.
&quot;When you step away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think it&#39;s happening in front of an audience,&quot; he writes.
Instead, it&#39;s as horrific as &quot;a condemned man hanged in secret.&quot;
Other observations are about the old Europe falling apart and about new forms of terror.
&quot;The conflict increasingly became an economic contest,&quot; writes Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot;
He captures the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the early century&#39;s bestiary&quot;: &quot;the eloquent and ideologically staunch mass murderer in a tailored suit who butchers while seated behind a desk.&quot;
People behave in unforeseen ways, and there is frivolous behavior as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to contract an STD from a prostitute to escape front-line service.
&quot;The grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, for soldiers bought and smeared it on their genitals in hopes of getting into the hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;Those who were truly distressed would rub it in their eyes, resulting in them being blind for the rest of their lives.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund&#39;s poetry becomes supple yet unassuming, adapting perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures how the war &quot;uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot;
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books on WWI tended to be more biased, like Paul Fussell&#39;s Great War and Modern Memory, or novels like Erich Maria Remarque&#39;s Nothing New in the West, than lengthy history books.
Englund&#39;s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I&#39;ve ever read about in non-fiction.
I don&#39;t give it away anymore.
But it&#39;s as if he had snatched that page with the main characters from under our noses in his book and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The decision was made for the night from Monday to Tuesday because there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park at this time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially thought they were taking part in an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials ramped up so-called chaos training -- counterterrorism measures that include rapidly moving large numbers of police officers -- to focus on lower Manhattan.
The final training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said someone familiar with the orders, which made it an &quot;exercise&quot; declaration.
&quot;The few police officers who were involved, as far as I know, didn&#39;t know it was about Zuccotti Park,&quot; said someone who asked to remain anonymous.
&quot;The only ones who knew that Zuccotti Park was at stake were the senior officials at the department.&quot;
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
Officials tried to clear the park on October 14, but backed down when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday&#39;s operation, including task forces from across the city -- hundreds of mobile officers typically deployed in high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said there are many people in and out of the park throughout the day, almost like commuters, so 1am at night is a good time to go in.
&quot;It was appropriate to do this when there were the fewest number of people in the park,&quot; he said.
Ambulances with jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were waiting in front of the exit at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages blaring from the speakers seemed to intimidate many of the protesters.
When public officials in their light blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply gathered up their belongings and left.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Commissioner of Police, said it was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim they were prevented from observing police action in the park. And they said the officers were very rough.
Mr Browne said television vans could have taken pictures on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As police made their way west through the mess of protesters&#39; personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, they were followed by city sanitation workers who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this soon appeared on the Internet.
A main core of protesters took up positions near the camp&#39;s kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp tied their arms together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.
Civil Protection officers were called to cut them loose.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 am.
According to the police, the evacuation was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested at the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were based on &quot;improper conduct and resisting arrest.&quot;
The most prominent officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the department chief, the highest uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, detective&#39;s division chief, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly &quot;did not direct the operation&quot;, as Mr Browne said.
A second group of officers waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they did.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From these locations, police could be seen expanding their perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
At one location, several officers, many with riot shields, were seen herding people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the night&#39;s most violent action took place in the south of the park.
At around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters deflated the tire of a police bus.
At one point, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester were taken to the hospital.
Caregivers&#39; union to file lawsuit against city over layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory because of their undue influence on the schools that educate poor students.
The lawsuit is likely the last resort open to the union, District 37, in its efforts to reverse the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other workers who were among the city&#39;s lowest-paid employees lost their jobs on Oct. 7 in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for the city&#39;s banning of access to the past year a health fund maintained by the working groups to fill the budget gap.
These allegations were categorically denied by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, school director Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council fired back, explaining that nothing in the budget specified school aid workers would be fired.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Department of Education against a lawsuit. There will be a press conference on Wednesday formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city&#39;s Department of Education as defendants and list eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are Black or Hispanic women, like most of the workers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city&#39;s Justice Department, said the city does not have the lawsuit and cannot comment on its individual allegations.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city&#39;s slums to support an unequal treatment lawsuit. She claims that poor schools have lost more volunteers because they are chronically underfunded.
She states that while there have been no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants have lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants in Districts 8 and 9 in of the South Bronx were released.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of well-heeled parents who can organize donations to help accommodate budget cuts.&quot;
PS District 36&#39;s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complained that high school principals were misled by the language in a memo authorizing the firing of care coordinators.
The memo used the word &quot;excess&quot; to describe the plot, although in the US &quot;excess&quot; commonly describes a teacher&#39;s transfer from a school&#39;s payroll to a pool of available workers managed by the central office get paid.
&quot;Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred,&quot; the draft lawsuit says.
Mission complete, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It finally looks like Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington agreeing on the Libyan uprising.
All it took was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and an end to American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee will pass a resolution co-chaired by Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), crediting Libya for the successful rebellion and US American troops for their &quot;courage&quot;.
&quot;This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have started to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said.
&quot;It is a confirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic efforts.&quot;
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House squabbled over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving of the US military&#39;s role in NATO&#39;s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this bill fell through in the Senate. The chamber also overruled a decision to cut funding for US operations in Libya.
This left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory, with a Congress angry enough to criticize Obama&#39;s handling of the mission but not angry enough to finally pull the rug out from under him.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The International Relations Committee&#39;s resolution &quot;congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who are conducting military operations to protect the people of Libya support, for their exceptional courage and professionalism.&quot;
The resolution also reaffirms &quot;the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible Libyan transition to democracy.&quot;
Will the new measures get the full backing of the Foreign Relations Panel, or will they divide lawmakers like the June law did?
The final version met with opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee&#39;s top Republican.
Lugar&#39;s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it&#39;s up to the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every Republican and some Democratic congressional term.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area currently coming to a Senate or Congress vote.
Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to get their amendments put to the vote, though they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte&#39;s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same law was presented to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would &quot;control federal spending.&quot;
Some of the statutes are identical, too, but they give their employers -- particularly novice Republicans looking to brush up on their resumes -- the opportunity to brag that they &quot;wrote&quot; such a policy.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of regulations members of Congress can introduce, while Republican Jose E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the two-term presidential limit.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a recurring template, as is an amendment banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
As eager as the members are to propose changes, they are moving much faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, when members routinely proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren&#39;t much more successful than today&#39;s either.
The last amendment to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
&quot;Hit, but not defeated,&quot; said Giffords in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point blank range during a campaign rally in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone on the Broadway play The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow and said the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC News&#39; 20/20 with Diane Sawyer, she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and traversed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after January&#39;s assassination, which killed six and wounded 13, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as &quot;difficult&quot;.
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gifford (41) replied, &quot;Pretty good.&quot;
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long &quot;20/20&quot; special taped shortly before the release of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.&quot;
The special follows Gifford&#39;s recovery since the Jan. 8 assassination.
In videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she can be seen in the hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift a finger or two when encouraged by her husband.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lips.
And then, her first words: &quot;What.&quot;
After a few days, Giffords whispered another word: &quot;Toast.&quot; She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos playing on the ABC show show that music played an important part in Giffords&#39; recovery: the congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to Cyndi Lauper&#39;s &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; and Tom Petty&#39;s &quot;Free Fallin&#39;&quot; sings.
Interviewed by Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day in therapy, said she doesn&#39;t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he was reading a newspaper article about the assassination to Giffords on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed in the assassination.
Shooter suspect Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri jail on compulsory medical treatment while awaiting trial.
&quot;A lot of people died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
During his wife&#39;s recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, &quot;I got hit.&quot;
&quot;So I would say, &#39;Gabby, you weren&#39;t defeated&#39;?&quot; Kelly said.
You just got hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines rallied around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood and applauded.
&quot;The soldiers were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, watched by Chief of Staff and then-Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the troops&#39; role differently.
&quot;They were introduced like orphans,&quot; the officer wrote in an email.
I&#39;m sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn&#39;t respect, really. It was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if it feels sorry for the people in uniform.
&quot;We weren&#39;t victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
&quot;But apparently the only way to get support is to frame us as unfortunate souls.&quot;
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger meted out to returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks of pity take place quietly and privately between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside of the military world could view their service from two different perspectives.
Some would regard them with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and traveled to exotic locations.
Others would wonder if an &quot;angry, violent veteran lurks beneath the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior state post in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewers were subtly asking if he would be able to withstand the pressures of a demanding post in Washington soon after returning from combat.
&quot;When you talk about your ministry, you have to counter the negative impressions,&quot; Cancian told his sons.
The military&#39;s lack of ease stems in part from Americans&#39; lack of interest in the war.
Battlefield performance is rarely singled out for praise by a country with little military experience and little benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;We as a nation no longer value military heroism in the way that we absolutely did in World War II,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, much of the praise from politicians and the public focuses on the suffering of a member of staff.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will face charges of failure to intervene in a court-martial rape.
If that doesn&#39;t happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008 and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beers.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
&quot;My alarm bells went off,&quot; Lyman said.
But the Texan brushed her concerns aside.
I thought, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s 19.
He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; she said.
&quot;I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.&quot;
Minutes after they walked into Lyman&#39;s room, the man came up behind her, held her down and, she alleges, raped her.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees anxiously await a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they are bringing against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread rape within the military and in violation of soldiers&#39; constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, DC attorney, the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 over the following months: 25 women and three men, all alleging that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers , and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide adequate jurisdiction following the alleged attacks.
Burke says she&#39;s tracking top military leadership because that&#39;s where the problem starts.
&quot;The military is hierarchical,&quot; she says.
&quot;Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership.&quot;
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will file many more lawsuits if necessary to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by US Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
Court filings obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy, first and foremost that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries sustained by active-duty soldiers.
&quot;The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs&#39; military service,&quot; says the document.
The Department of Defense has declined to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not authorized to serve in combat, the only distinction is in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, particularly in connecting with local women in war zones.
The result: 150 female soldiers died between these two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It&#39;s time the military modernized, says Burke.
And she&#39;s not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans&#39; Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynist atmosphere.
Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the &quot;personality disorder&quot; diagnosis given to rape victims in order to remove them from the service -- a common practice, according to activists like the service&#39;s Anu Bhagwati Women&#39;s Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, alleging discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for people who say they have been sexually abused on the job.
Nine bills were independently introduced to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives from both parties, offering a number of leads.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuse reports were reported by the Defense Department&#39;s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses go unreported, and by the Pentagon&#39;s own estimate, that number accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military went to court, half the rate in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke&#39;s case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman&#39;s case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a slew of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and her attacker&#39;s blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During that hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend prior to the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
&quot;I still remember the day the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I thought I was going to go into labor. I ran out of the courtroom screaming.&quot;
&quot;They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out I said to my commander: That wasn&#39;t his procedure. That was my procedure.&quot;
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed her with a personality disorder and declared her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged without receiving any support.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed will go ahead is pure speculation, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, &quot;I think they should move forward.&quot;
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is a decade behind because they don&#39;t have the same incentive and deterrent that liability brings.
He adds: &quot;The odds are against them... but it&#39;s important for them to try.&quot;
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn&#39;t follow her path, Burke, the plaintiffs&#39; attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
&quot;We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made,&quot; she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers observe you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of far-right extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to being involved in a shooting spree in Norway in July that killed 77 people, had his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much of the time leading up to his attack in front of his computer chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer&#39;s tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It&#39;s easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
&quot;We found that it wasn&#39;t difficult to get to them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook&#39;s stash of personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply have to use the site&#39;s advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographics with scientific rigor -- just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but rather than linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to take a poll asking about their educational level, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave their office.
&quot;It&#39;s a fairly new research method,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resentful of immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, &quot;those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sane, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.&quot;
DEMO&#39;s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends, as seen in &quot;likes,&quot; text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook&#39;s &quot;data supernova&quot; is generating a research boom that has seen the number of scientific papers with this site&#39;s name in the title increase by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that through this site you can study people you wouldn&#39;t normally reach with your clipboard on the street.
&quot;In the past, if you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;They had to inform the party first and they would never have let them in,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook doesn&#39;t do all that - you go straight to them.&quot;
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge drinking on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problem drinking than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student when it posts too many status updates.
&quot;You can&#39;t solve a problem if you don&#39;t recognize it,&quot; Dimitri Christakis, Moreno&#39;s co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children&#39;s Research Institute in Seattle, told The Washington Post.
&quot;We found a way to identify vulnerable children that would not have been found otherwise.&quot;
Facebook is also constantly tapping into data from its own population.
The site&#39;s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine&#39;s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data only Facebook has access to - digital freedom champions have long known that the site gives its should make a large data repository accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know the page is watching them whether they want it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to reveal your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don&#39;t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, anything goes online.
&quot;I don&#39;t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of Studied students on Facebook.
&quot;As for her, it was all about her and her friends.&quot;
Then there is the issue of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it&#39;s impossible to know how much of the information in a user&#39;s profile and post is true.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
&quot;There&#39;s no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research needs to look at the social - and a lot of social life still happens offline.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two rampages that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway,&quot; he told a courtroom of more than 500 people.
&quot;I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I accept the laws, but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue as he &quot;did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused permission for Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to address his victims&#39; families at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks with four weeks off media access. He said authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to catch a glimpse of Breivik, others wanted reassurance that he remains under lock and key.
Everyone participated with the aim that everything boils down to a lock away.
&quot;I thought he seemed cold and inhuman,&quot; a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
&quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a little further after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot;
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing. He locked eyes with journalists and survivors as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik&#39;s bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge concluded he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence he had any accomplices.
It may please some that the July 22 attacks appeared to be the work of a single extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the heartache and confusion an entire nation still feels?
&quot;I wish he looked like a monster but he doesn&#39;t,&quot; said a relative of one victim.
&quot;It would be so much easier if he did.&quot;
7 lessons from the late Steve Jobs interview shown at a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, citing the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But perhaps what Apple fans will find most telling in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted this week ahead of special screenings in major markets, is how well this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who avidly tinkered with diagrams - a man who believed many business leaders suffered from &quot;a disease of thinking, &#39;that a really great one Idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there&#39;s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.&quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely created the TV series &quot;Triumph of the Geeks&quot; about the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour during which they had one of those rare in-depth conversations.
At this point, more than 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already hard at work on his new computer company, NeXT, looking forward to widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley&#39;s interview was used in Fachidiot, he says the interview master copies were missing when it was delivered.
It wasn&#39;t until after Job&#39;s death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director&#39;s garage.
This slightly remastered footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film &quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview,&quot; which hits Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who has a reputation for abhorring lengthy interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the course of the interview, there are four lengthy pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of contemplation, during which Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts and striving for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs&#39;s perfectionism comes to the fore, when he seems to react impatiently to Cringely&#39;s questions and nudges him to move more quickly on issues or subplots of greater importance.
Recorded before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, the Lost Interview seems somehow eerily prescient as Jobs assesses what he thinks other companies are doing right and wrong and sets out his own vision of the future of computing.
It&#39;s one thing to read posthumous tributes to Jobs&#39; career. But seeing Jobs here as the aspiring dreamer on the verge of greatness is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he did all this, he went out and did it.
A quick look at seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
&quot;Throughout my years in business, I always ask, &#39;Why do you do things?&#39; And the answer you always get is, &#39;Oh, that&#39;s just the way it&#39;s done.&#39;
Nobody knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks deeply about things.
I have found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed at how costs were recorded - most often starting with &quot;standard costs&quot; which were calculated on mere guesswork and then adjusted with &quot;variance&quot; - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the cost of doing business could be pinpointed down to the last detail .
How the Pope was teased:
Jobs tells of the &quot;blue box&quot; he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed you to sneak into the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs&#39; enthusiasm as he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&amp;T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We sent stuff around the world half a dozen times and if you yelled into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,&quot; Jobs says with a chuckle.
&quot;We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.&quot;
Both of us, we didn&#39;t know much, but being able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don&#39;t think Apple would exist without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank he and Wozniak almost pulled when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to speak to the Pope while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
With several members of the Catholic hierarchy summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst out laughing before the Pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with tech (and, unprepared, called Bill Hewlett):
At age 12, while looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs landed a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
&quot;It had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views of what a company was and how well it treated its employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company&#39;s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made&quot;.
It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with a Braun tube, and I fell in love with it.
I would climb up HP as a teenager and be attached to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Jobs talks several times in the interview about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble the whole computer.
Working with a payment deadline of just 30 days, he had to think through both assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had developing a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember making powerful arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.&quot;
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly believable.
About Big Companies Slacking:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their vision and lost control of their stocks.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?&quot;
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it&#39;s people like that] who ultimately run the company and the product that push people out of the decision-making process.
The product genius that led to this monopoly is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if that could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They caught defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
&quot;There&#39;s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... as you develop that great idea, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to do attunements, certain things you can&#39;t do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and put them all together...
Ultimately it comes down to taste, it comes down to trying to engage with the best stuff that humans have made and then trying to bring those things together into what you&#39;re making.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn&#39;t for computers, they would be doing amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws as court takes case
On the day that the Supreme Court is meeting behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama&#39;s health care laws, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to consider the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the sweeping health care reforms passed by Congress last year, legislation that has become a buzzword among conservative activists across the US.
The judges approved the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour groundbreaking debate is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is announced.
The attorney who will stand in court and claim that the law should be overturned will likely be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement&#39;s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade bodies, the National Federation of Independent Business, challenging the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court considered the case.
Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Senate Republican faction and a declared opponent of health care reform, was on duty, among others
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federal Society events for years.
And that doesn&#39;t violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges break free from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower-level federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: &quot;A judge may attend fundraisers organized by law enforcement and other organizations, provided that the judge is not a speaker, guest of honor, or a guest according to the program at such events.&quot;
Nonetheless, Scalia and Thomas&#39; extreme closeness to two of the law firms involved in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alarm morale and government activists.
&quot;This startling breach of morality and dissent from the code belies claims by some judges that the court is following the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a US civil rights movement.
&quot;The judges won and dined during a fundraiser with attorneys with pending cases in court.&quot;
Your appearance and support for a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they too easily confuse court affairs with agenda-led groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas&#39; wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first instance of legal challenges went to court.
Her detractors urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case on bias, saying she was too engaged in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan makes no move to do so.
Boeing lands record $18 trillion order
Emirates airline has ordered 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal valued at more than $1 trillion.
It&#39;s really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products.
But it&#39;s big business when the company is airplane maker Boeing Co. and the combined list price for those 50 planes is a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing&#39;s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle East airlines will need 2,520 planes, worth $450 trillion, over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest-ever commercial aircraft order by order value over the weekend: 50 Boeing 777 double-aisle jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show, taking the total list price to $26 trillion.
According to Boeing, Oman Air then ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort enormously on Monday.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
&quot;This is absolutely positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, Morningstar&#39;s stock market specialist.
&quot;The quality of these special customers is very high.&quot;
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which typically hurts airlines because it&#39;s one of their biggest expense items, isn&#39;t as damaging since the country benefits from higher oil prices.
That&#39;s important because they&#39;re less likely than other airlines to cancel or postpone plane orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
&quot;They have a natural hedge,&quot; he said.
The Emirates order reaffirms Boeing&#39;s leadership in the widebody market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking supremacy with the A350.
Boeing&#39;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would delay launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
Delayed launch to gain more confidence after customers demanded higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President&#39;s Sister Seems to Lose Michoacan Election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims drug dealers supported opponents of the PRI&#39;s Fausto Vallejo in the gubernatorial race.
President Felipe Calderon&#39;s sister has apparently lost her bid for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state election. She claimed Monday drug dealers tipped the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, has won the governorship race in the western state.
&quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacan but for the whole country,&quot; Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday&#39;s election.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... They manned polling booths, set up roadblocks... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI].&quot;
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But they are looking to return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had been leading in the pre-election polls.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother&#39;s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), who is currently incumbent governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the Morelia capital, has denied links to drug dealers and is urging the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been ruled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed during a campaign rally for Luisa Maria Calderon a week before the election and scores of candidates have pulled out of local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the Michoacan elections seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: &quot;I think this win makes us look boldly into next year.&quot;
ADB urges Asia for help in Eurozone rescue
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to help bail out the eurozone from its deep debt crisis to prevent a long-term downturn that will slow Asia&#39;s economy growth.
Rajat Nag, executive director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world&#39;s two fastest growing economies must do &quot;everything in their power&quot; to accelerate the bloc&#39;s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) countries &quot;dispassionate&quot; about the troubles in Europe, saying that Asia&#39;s financial backing of European leaders and resources could mean a long-term collapse of the global economy helps to prevent.
&quot;We&#39;re all in the same boat.&quot;
&quot;So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
&quot;Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, then by all means.&quot;
In the past few months, Europe&#39;s currency union has fallen into a severe debt crisis.
In the past few days, Italy&#39;s interest costs have risen dangerously and both Italy&#39;s and Greece&#39;s prime ministers have resigned.
The looming deep debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could slide into recession and prompting calls for leading emerging economies to band together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted any support to Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said reciprocal deals - such as buying EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer European partners in Asia greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, India&#39;s trade minister, said that &quot;India will do everything in its power&quot; to help the euro zone as its economy is now suffering from falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital flows.
&quot;No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We face great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not an option, it&#39;s a mission, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?&quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at US-based Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell Aid to Europe to India&#39;s 1.2 trillion people, of whom more than 800 million are on $2 or less a day life.
&quot;At some point they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go to the beach for vacations. Then you have a problem,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why India&#39;s reserves should be used to keep Greece&#39;s numerous and well-paid civil servants, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railways.
Mr Nag said the crises in the euro zone will have &quot;significant knock-on effects&quot; across Asia.
The ADB&#39;s forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/is now threatened with &quot;the risk of downgrading&quot; due to the looming threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to have &quot;contingency plans&quot; in place to protect themselves in the event of a downturn and significant capital exodus from their communities.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed weaken national security. In doing so, he set off a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the Afghan theaters of war and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears another cut of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to get a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
&quot;Such a large cut, done in such a thoughtless manner, would render most of our ship and building projects unfeasible - you can&#39;t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote to senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to involuntarily part ways with much of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to reach the target.&quot;
&quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness.&quot;
The cuts would ultimately hit combat troops,&quot; Panetta said.
&quot;While wartime anti-terrorist contingents will not be directly affected by the confiscation, the severe intrusion into the base budget would adversely affect the war effort,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;Staff hiring was being cut, causing delays in hiring and hiring oversight in support of the war.&quot;
&quot;Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and disrupting legal as well as political support.&quot;
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequences of a Department of Defense seizure would usher in a rapid decline for the United States as the world&#39;s leading military power.&quot;
&quot;We strongly oppose this draconian act,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta&#39;s letter.
&quot;This is a result we cannot live with and certainly not one to be forced upon us.&quot;
&quot;The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to occur.&quot;
Whether Panetta&#39;s letter and the senators&#39; new warnings will increase pressure for a budget compromise or fuel calls for the Pentagon to be exempted from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he has many years of budgetary experience in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with shell but no core.
&quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a brigade with no ammunition.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to contend with potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;She actually makes you angry.&quot;
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details of how reductions &quot;create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, seriously curtailing our global responsiveness, leading to unacceptable risk in future wartime operations .&quot;
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to cancellation, including those that have already been tested and are in the early planning stages.
Also included in that list are the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a proposed new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it&#39;s an important next step in upgrading, avoiding potential threats from China and other adversaries can be banned.
How to spot a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with allegations of sexual harassment from several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State officials have been charged with perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, over an open microphone, French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself circulating denials that were quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations linked to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who lived to see it forgets the media frenzy unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories of cheating at school and on college exams are common.
There have been instances where teachers have provided their students with exam answers so that they can do well on their own assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies are considered white lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Detecting lies, or &quot;detecting lies,&quot; is a skill that is important for everyone to learn, for both personal and professional reasons.
A far cry from a parlor game such as charades, in which the goal is &quot;Have you!&quot; to shout, deception detection is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities conducting wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don&#39;t always stutter, stammer, blush, or fidget.
However, one should not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and unmask.
A skilled lie-detector can break through to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the subtle facial expressions, questioning, and timing.
I have spent several years researching the scientific evidence in the vast and ever-expanding field of exposure. And it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us navigate our complex world, especially when one&#39;s job responsibilities involve hiring or interviewing people or negotiating or managing .
Good liars are very good at gauging other people, getting their interest, and controlling their own emotions. And they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell &quot;self-oriented&quot; lies more often than women, whose lies are more &quot;other-oriented&quot;—usually to protect other people&#39;s feelings—that married People lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly &quot;fat lies&quot;).
We also know that when a person is exposed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing that person&#39;s normal behavior.
This is called &quot;baselining&quot;, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the quality of the voice of your subject.
They&#39;d better know when someone usually taps their feet all the time so they don&#39;t unfairly blame them for tapping their feet during a meeting.
Then look out for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Think of these clusters as alarm bells ringing, not evidence of exposure.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet are pointing toward the door or they&#39;re leaning toward the exit, changing their position in a significant way, or exhibiting a &quot;post-interview relaxation,&quot; that deep, relaxing exhale and shift in posture when all the tough questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that post-interview relaxation.
Also pay attention to the language of your test subject.
Scott Peterson&#39;s slip is famous when he used the past tense when claiming his slain wife was still alive, sparking a national search for her.
Deceptive people may also use distancing language: &quot;I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman...Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeating a tricky question in its entirety.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use &quot;qualifying language&quot; when answering a tricky question: &quot;Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge.&quot;
This makes the response perceptual rather than factual, which often sets off alarm bells.
There is no magic cure for detecting lies, but you can learn skills that will allow detection.
With these skills, everyone can be less likely to fall victim to scammers, both in their personal and professional lives.
Controversial oil pipeline plan is revised after being jeopardized by delayed US approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering unions while reassuring environmentalists, the company building the pipeline is scrambling to reschedule the project, so that we can get back to normal.
TransCanada said Monday night it will divert the proposed pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska State House.
TransCanada&#39;s Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different trajectory.
This comes after an announcement by the State Department last week that it would defer a decision on federal approval for the project pending the review of the new potential path, which includes the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, avoid.
&quot;This is a real step forward,&quot; Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may delay a decision until 2013, after next year&#39;s election, though officials deny politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department responsibility and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline would connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, estimating the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing the legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department&#39;s recent environmental impact study found that the project would have little environmental impact, but the energy industry source says the department&#39;s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues .
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton&#39;s advisor in 2008, has a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company hired to conduct the original study was an improper choice given its affiliation with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged for allegedly forcing toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle threw a tantrum in the lobby of their Manhattan building, leaving their young daughter so frightened that she threw up.
The &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer&#39;s tirade so scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk that she suffered from &quot;personality changes, trouble sleeping&quot; and &quot;increased fear of strangers,&quot; her family said in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were about to leave for a family day out.
While Kevin Monk got the car, Roseanna Monk walked into the lobby of her building on Riverside Boulevard with the luggage and Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said, &#39;Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?&#39; I said, &#39;Yes,&#39; and went to pick her up again,&quot; she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
&quot;She said in an aggressive tone, &#39;You shouldn&#39;t drop your daughter near the door,&#39;&quot; Roseanna Monk said.
&quot;I told her, &#39;I don&#39;t care what you say or think&#39;.&quot;
She got angry and started ranting - using the F-word and the A-word and getting very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started pouring water from the bottle at me.
She said Genevieve went hysterical.
&quot;I said to this woman, &#39;Look what you did to my daughter,&#39;&quot; the child&#39;s mother said.
LaBelle lunged at the mother, still carrying Genevieve, and had to be restrained by her escort and dragged to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby cried so hard he vomited, she said.
The LaBelle family later wrote to ask for an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle&#39;s attorney and representative did not return calls seeking comment.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but family attorney Sam Davis said he is not charging a fee and the family plans to donate any money they receive to Children&#39;s Cancer Aid.
&quot;We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is shown to a kindergarten teacher who is carrying an 18-month-old baby.&quot;
Climatic adversities slowed the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez has been in power, Sinaloa experienced unemployment and undeclared work while foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa&#39;s economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised high hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of the climatic adversities, there can be no talk of growth, on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of dollars in agricultural losses, but also severely limited the growth of the state economy and caused an overall decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report released by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural lands were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely damaged and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially damaged were destroyed. Vegetable, maize and chickpea cultivation were particularly affected.
The decline in economic activity through November has seen unemployment rise steadily in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the labor force. The unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent in the second quarter and 6.19 percent from July to September, leaving 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. That is 18,969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa for the year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain rising unemployment.
&quot;What we are seeing right now is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among them, liquidity losses in the market as a result of the funding cuts by the anti-money laundering legislation passed in Congress, for those who are illegally When you accumulate dollars, it&#39;s not easy to make them work for you, invest them or use them for anything else,&quot; he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor inherent in the growing unemployment.
&quot;The number of people leaving the country to look for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is partly due to the problems with entry and partly because it is difficult to find work there too. These people are staying here looking for work, which increases unemployment,&quot; he says.
undeclared work
Analyzing the labor market in Sinaloa is even more weighty when considering the high percentage of undeclared work. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of those employed in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared work are compounded by low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Agency) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexico&#39;s Government Agency for Labor and Social Welfare).
The average monthly wage for Sinaloa workers through September was 5,352 pesos; that&#39;s a lot less than the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
decline in FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, 2011 saw the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Agency), FDI from January to June was $630,597, down 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
For its part, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) reports a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debts
Faced with the economic crisis, in July the state government applied to the National Congress for a loan of 3,000,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The national congress approved an amount of 200,600,000 pesos, but as of November, no positive impact of the debt on any of the country&#39;s economic sectors could be identified.
reactions
For the representatives of the business community, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé&#39;s inability to govern obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexico&#39;s State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry), argued that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
&quot;Economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year. Hard work is needed to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we need to redouble our efforts. The efforts of everyone, and particularly the progress of the already well-aligned government team, are not sufficiently coordinated,&quot; he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year have complicated and slowed down the country&#39;s economic development.
&quot;The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the freeze. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not moving enough to generate economic momentum that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services end the year well below our expectations,&quot; he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico&#39;s Confederation of Entrepreneurs) in Sinaloa, said the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
&quot;In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that there is a need to develop a long-term program for redefining the country&#39;s economic vocation and lineage because it is important to activate all of Sinaloa&#39;s material and human resources,&quot; he said.
There is much to do
The Coparmex chairman stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will direct the government&#39;s efforts in a better direction.
&quot;In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program,&quot; he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made strides in government.
&quot;There are areas where it can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and the government is aware that there is still a lot of work to be done,&quot; he said.
Arrested for 8kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
Republic prosecutors said the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a public health offense - here, possession of marijuana for trafficking.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, on June 7, 2010, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military officers while patrolling Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite guard post number 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the van and a small backpack on the passenger seat, in which the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the offender is still in the prison.
construction debt
The social housing projects for migrants envisaged in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs are at risk of not being completed due to a lack of funds or only with a long delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the city&#39;s Department of Social Development explained that although the construction programs are well advanced, they are now in jeopardy as the state government has failed to pay its due funds, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs is nearly 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which goes to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of construction is to be expected.
&quot;They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven&#39;t given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part in July,&quot; he said. &quot;In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work and it is already well advanced, but we need the money.&quot;
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his reign. That would correspond to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
&quot;We were like that in the last legislature because the state didn&#39;t have enough economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to find the funds that the state hadn&#39;t raised to participate in these programs.&quot; , he explained.
Although the state authorities are obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that a request has been made to the Minister of Administration and Finance, , to speed up the administrative work and disburse the outstanding portion as soon as possible.
&quot;They have to contribute almost 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, they haven&#39;t given us a penny.&quot;
Court approves transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The conversion from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional complaints brought by the Senate and House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, by virtue of which the switch from analog to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law are, back.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when issuing the decree-law detailing the switchover to digital terrestrial television.
With this resolution, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not receive the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. So the law remains in force.
The draft lawsuit, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree-law unconstitutional, since the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunications Commission) is responsible for regulating radio and television in Mexico) is competent, therefore the decree-law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the provisos of the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted in favor of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the legislative decree. After accepting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree-law and suspended all activities to set up digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister expressed his disagreement with the project&#39;s arguments, namely that the state government should not use general regulations to regulate the measures that the public administration should take.
&quot;I also don&#39;t think that if you did that, the independence of the regulator would be compromised.&quot; She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, strategic policy planning, such as the telecommunications sector, is the responsibility of the central government, which directs state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the switch, she said, is a delay in reaping the benefits of digitization, which is a public interest decision that doesn&#39;t just have technical aspects, &quot;because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects.&quot;
These matters, she stressed, &quot;required the action of the whole system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they contained a set of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central state government.&quot;
She recalled that many countries around the world had already made the digital transition, through government, despite having highly specialized institutions.
&quot;One cannot conclude that the government is interfering with the powers of Congress by issuing the contested legislative decree because the laws passed by the legislature are being upheld,&quot; she asserted.
The possibility of individually counting ballots in Michoacán is under consideration
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor&#39;s election is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 still to be counted.
The ability to count ballots one by one is a reality in this year&#39;s Michoacán elections, as according to data released by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th the electoral body passed a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states had passed in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted its political constitution, electoral law or electoral justice law to the reforms passed by Congress, so these did not come into force at this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the state gazette within the time limit set for it, arguing that he still had objections to it.
On November 9, Mexico&#39;s Supreme Court (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature, ruling the state commissioner&#39;s vote on constitutional reforms &quot;invalid and unlawful&quot; because he did not have the right to &quot;decide or veto.&quot; to object&quot;.
María de los Ángeles Llanderal, when interviewed about the possibility of counting the votes individually, explained that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility for the local electoral authority to count the ballot papers partially or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages can be partially counted The results in the minutes do not match; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not available on file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee, or there are obvious errors or changes in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the completed ballot papers may be made if there is a difference of equal to or less than one percent between the putative winner and the person placed second, provided that there is an express request from the President at the beginning of the session party or coalition leader, who is the second of the named candidates.
The count of votes may also be taken in its entirety if, after the completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate for second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided there is an express request from a representative of the party whose candidate came second. In this case, the electoral packages that were subjected to a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening. On Monday the inquest and a funeral mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel&#39;s last wish was that his ashes be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, Bacio Cortés&#39; family returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane, along with the others who died in the accident. The people closest to the Colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel&#39;s ashes landed on the mourning hall located on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family members and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Technological Institute. This inquest was prompted by his former technical high school classmates and his American football team, which Felipe Bacio was on while he was preparing for high school.
&quot;He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains. He always said that to his family and friends,&quot; revealed Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot&#39;s sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he has lived the fullness of his life. &quot;He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family.&quot;
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to join the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn&#39;t believe it, saying he got dizzy even on a truck. Despite this, he always aspired to achieve his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. &quot;He had hardly arrived in Saltillo and the whole family wanted to greet him, like on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo.&quot;
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán for his family member&#39;s graduation. That&#39;s how he knows his uncle died doing what he loved best: flying an airplane.
One last goodbye
The lieutenant colonel of the Mexican air force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was given a farewell with honors under the direction of the governor Jorge Torres López. He was honored by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, principals and students at the Saltillo Technological School, where he graduated in 1985 and distinguished himself with excellence in both academics and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he was flying, which was also carrying State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same agency, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be delivered in the barracks forecourt by the undertaker to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major Jaime Martinez. His family members were already waiting for him there, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced the media to 11 people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of their body and a coup de grâce in an abandoned finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The incident took place at kilometer 1.5 of the Cadereyta-Santiago road, near the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house, which was surrounded by a beige-brown wall, was wide open.
When they looked inside the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately reported to the relevant authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, no shoes; next to him lay another dressed in a white top.
About a meter away lay the body of another person in a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three lay on their stomachs.
According to information obtained on the spot, the three people must have been murdered elsewhere as no shell casings were found.
Inscriptions written by one organized criminal gang to another can be read on the wall of the country house, and several bullet holes were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat of State for National Defense) presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang operating mainly in the town of Cadereyta and who were involved in kidnapping, murder, halconeo (manhunting) and clandestine burials in to be connected.
According to the information made public, eight people were initially arrested and one prisoner released on November 11 in the Los Alveros settlement.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized. Those arrested confirmed that they were members of the criminal group Los Zetas.
At 6:00 a.m. on November 12, military personnel patrolling the Cadereyta township of Rancho Viejo found an unlicensed vehicle with two occupants.
Upon inspecting the car, the military found a long gun, charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2:00 p.m., one of their accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to flee at the sight of the military.
They are accused of clandestine burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti is meeting the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government set up to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti is meeting the President of Italy tomorrow to present the new government set up to deal with the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
He is expected to unveil a majority technocrat cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present the results of talks with political parties to form a government to the President.
&quot;I would like to reiterate my absolute confidence in our country&#39;s ability to deal with these difficult times,&quot; the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not specifically confirm the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
&quot;The framework is now well defined,&quot; he added.
Monti managed to form a government in less than three days, much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of the debt to unbearable levels.
The new government, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package demanded by Euro-politicians in order to regain shattered confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti was compounded by volatile market conditions, which resulted in Italy&#39;s 10-year government bonds being charged at 7 percent. This corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland felt compelled to apply for the European bailout fund.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after meeting Monti: &quot;We said we would support this government as much as we could.&quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti&#39;s chances of success were significantly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi&#39;s PDL party, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
&quot;We believe that Professor Monti&#39;s efforts are destined to produce good results,&quot; said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
Support for the PDL, Italy&#39;s largest party, is essential because so far many of its members have opposed a technocrat-majority government that Monti is forming.
support from Parliament
Monti&#39;s new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting its efforts or delaying reforms could trigger another devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure, saying that a failure by Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women&#39;s organizations on Monday.
The session is scheduled to conclude Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief sigh of relief towards the end of last week when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits due to uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms rather than bringing the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by financial market pressures.
Political sources indicate that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of political figures.
Spaniards have more playing opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have more than 50 international games under their belts.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 call-ups has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when comparing the 22 players lined up for today&#39;s friendly at San Jose National Stadium at 15.05 CET.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA&#39;s monthly rankings, can look back on an impressive number of A-class appearances, the tricolor team only has defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández.
Playing in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs in the Premier League of England, Spanish players have the opportunity to take part in numerous home games (league and cup championships) as well as high-level European cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We shall see how the Spanish team draws its last stop: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (lost 0-1 in London) with 126 matches played abroad equaled with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the tricolor team today and Spain set a new record of 127 games abroad.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona football club player, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian side who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta at 126 and Schalke centre-forward Raúl González at 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number one hundred with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso at 91, Fernando Torres at 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both at 81, Andrés Iniesta at 62, Cesc Fábregas at 61 and David Silva at 53.
On the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are left flank Júnior Díaz with 48 games and forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five played over 30 games: Keilor Navas at 31, Randall Azofeifa at 32, Michael Barrantes at 31, Carlos Hernández at 36 and José Luis López at 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
For the national team, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23 have fewer than 30 games.
The rest don&#39;t even approach the 20 mark.
While Nacho Moreal has just four games and Jordi Alba has two, Costa Rica&#39;s Víctor Bolívar has one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are yet to make their debuts.
Spain&#39;s storied goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in their 20th anniversary tour
&quot;Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
Speaking exclusively to Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is geared up to play one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They have been awaited for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the group&#39;s bassist and co-founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is on the South American leg of their 20th anniversary tour and on Sunday 20th they will be making their only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30pm along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an excerpt of the conversation, a full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
A dream comes true for your Costa Rican fans when Pearl Jam plays Costa Rica: do you realize what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also coming true for us.
This is just the second time we&#39;ve played in South and Central America and so far it&#39;s been great.
I&#39;ve only been to Costa Rica once for vacation. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It&#39;s exciting for us to take our music there.
I&#39;m asking you this because the fans are totally devoted to the band. They experience the days before the concert very intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry it took so long to get here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn&#39;t that put a bit of pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we&#39;ve put on in the last 21 years have happened in the last two weeks.
We played some big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that got us ready for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world for this.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are just amazing.
My friends used to go to Costa Rica and Nicaragua to surf. Along with Mexico, these are great areas for surfing. That&#39;s how, through people who love surfing, we found out about it.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the Costa Rica event?
Since we&#39;ve never played there before, we don&#39;t set ourselves any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with a lot of different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that&#39;s partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so deciding which one to play isn&#39;t easy.
Adding two or three songs to our repertoire that we haven&#39;t played in a while helps us keep our focus and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked those songs. Otherwise they might be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you are celebrating your twenty year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes totally.
First of all, I don&#39;t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years. That looks like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and think it&#39;s great that we can still make music together.
We like each other and are passionate about making music.
We&#39;re lucky to be able to go to places in the world we&#39;ve always wanted to visit.
Things couldn&#39;t be better.
What did it mean to you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It&#39;s always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We&#39;re good friends with the folks at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and rather unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Once in a while a band will come out of a town, but it&#39;s unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same town at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We&#39;re happy to still be friends with all of them and honored to be a part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It&#39;s also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think we all consider ourselves lucky to be alive and besides, we care for each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical avenues have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and their music. We couldn&#39;t be better off.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we&#39;ve grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to tour too often because it&#39;s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds loving your music.
As long as you remember that people came for the music, it reminds you that you need to respect the music and what brought it to life without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We were never interested in that anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed that it took so long. We&#39;re still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who helped us build the band. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
Local band Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that&#39;s why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band the best. That&#39;s why we&#39;re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will definitely be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who were your influences as a bass player?
From so many+
First ones that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could spend the afternoon talking about the bass players I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge alive when it&#39;s no longer a fad?
I think we all don&#39;t feel very connected to the word grunge.
Thinking about it, I can think of the bands I mentioned earlier like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they&#39;re still relevant today, I think that&#39;s great because this music is worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
Initially their music was darker, now it&#39;s more positive.
Why?
That&#39;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem a bit flippant. But there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Both brought tears to my eyes when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - like losing a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs definitely embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori went to the hospital again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was rushed to a public hospital on Tuesday to assess muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor said.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights abuses during his reign (1990-2000), has multiple ailments, including tongue cancer, which has undergone four surgeries and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days at Peru&#39;s Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas hospital to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he thought Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he considered him innocent.
He has had four operations for tongue cancer and has lost 40 pounds. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Since September 2007, Fujimori has been held in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention center.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by the Peruvian army&#39;s death squad, which operated clandestinely during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, started its visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region
Mujica is meeting with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. That will be the culmination of his packed schedule of politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the Uruguayan president.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara &quot;is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries,&quot; announced the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón&#39;s support over the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still present themselves as tax havens. This statement was rejected by Uruguay, prompting an inquiry to its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group consisting of the world&#39;s most powerful emerging and industrialized countries. An agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation has been in place with the South American country since January of this year.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the specification of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the &quot;grey list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Countries that have not introduced all international standards on tax cooperation stand on it.
On a business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustachioed plumber enters the third dimension with &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser&#39;s clutches, but until now never in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he fights for the girl&#39;s love in stereo technology.
The game, which hits stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the start for the properties of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which allows three-dimensional gaming without the need for special glasses.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses,&quot; assured Omar Álvarez, the person in charge of Nintendo&#39;s specialized press in Spain, at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;Nintendo&#39;s first video game that was developed from the ground up for this console&quot; , because hitherto hit articles like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; have been Adjustments to existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman underlined that although it is three-dimensional, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;affordable&quot; video game that allows fast, smooth gameplay.
Álvarez confirmed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; would contain two games in one: the first part is &quot;easy&quot; to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can &quot;do a second round&quot; over the different game levels, which become more and more difficult.
Also, users can choose in real-time between an &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, in order to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the &quot;optical effects&quot;, the game always has to be played in three dimensions.
This foray into the 3D world by Super Mario also marks the character&#39;s return to a portable console, which hasn&#39;t been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the winning formula of the last editions: the mustachioed plumber must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters new moves, environments, disguises and enemies - and a &quot;playable&quot; Luigi.
Colom vouches for Portillo&#39;s extradition to the United States
Guatemalan President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he would authorize the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to stand trial in the United States for a $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus ends the trial of the United States&#39; request for Portillo&#39;s extradition to stand trial there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and government, given that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his administration he did not interfere in court decisions and granted all extradition requests of which he was made aware.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and aggravated assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom&#39;s action is a government act that comes after all judicial and constitutional processes to convict the former President (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal position in Guatemala is settled and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million quetzales from the Defense Department during his reign. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without professional training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
Added to this are the more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
To mark the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former Fabra i Coats factory, attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was created in 1986 in the district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with little education, without work, with drug problems and at risk of marginality.
Yesterday&#39;s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many leaders of establishments and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different tendencies at the time of the election campaign proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations were attended by former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green councilor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister for Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Works of the Savings Bank of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also visited the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today&#39;s times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far &quot;is a good basis&quot;.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
&quot;The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it is doing,&quot; he explained.
Squat, where huge parties were held, was evacuated
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without putting up any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house number 51 on Calle Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied and where they had organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to desperation at noon yesterday. The eviction was carried out by order of a judge without any police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was changed to avoid a similar situation.
&quot;From now on, access will be controlled,&quot; confirmed the property manager.
The squatters, who occupied 11 of the building&#39;s 13 apartments - the remainder were occupied - took away the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of rubbish, mostly cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were celebrated on the three lower floors, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business has dropped by 80% since the squat began.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the squatters were unfairly competing with her by selling the drinks for 3 euros, while in the discotheque they cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure center had been reported by the neighbors for disturbing the peace, while according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors to the disco, but from the squatters and, in particular, from the guests of the parties that were organized there and who, according to the disgruntled neighbors have become more and longer in recent weeks.
The manager of the nightclub explained that the nuisance was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular - People&#39;s Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week called for the building to be vacated immediately and for the problems of civic coexistence and the dilapidation of the neighborhood to be tackled.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but that in recent months squatters have penetrated all floors of the building and almost all apartments. Some had even been stolen.
In this sense, he added that &quot;there is a need to end impunity and crack down on anti-social acts in the building.&quot;
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris neighborhood was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who saw four people trying to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
park or mountain?
Apart from the arguments about the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The municipal tender for the 16 Gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), that administration published its diatribe on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to New York&#39;s Central Park.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, in the eyes of many, the park once again became the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but rather upwards (mountains) and downwards ( Sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
Central Park was no longer used as a model, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogi bear.
That&#39;s how far things were when the city issued a huge tender consisting of 16 competitions for further access gates to Collserola in September.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that is so, or someone is planning to put gates on the land.
The question arises: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for proposals is the talking point on the lips of all architects from Barcelona, not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of reflecting on the city.
It&#39;s almost a recurrent subject for two members of this long-established caste who meet in the elevator to draw on.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, &quot;it is necessary&quot; after the attack on the coast to speak about the &quot;mountain front&quot;, as long as Ildefons Cerda&#39;s discourse on the green apples has not been carried out.
&quot;One should start from the principle that Barcelona&#39;s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex,&quot; judges the architect, for whom the title &quot;Gates of Collserola&quot; harbors a &quot;lexical trap&quot;: They should not be &quot;imagined as entrances to a park, but as the delimitation of areas where trade takes place must.&quot;
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; that harbors &quot;some dangers&quot;.
Dangers as a result of the &quot;uncertainty that the design of a public space entails nowadays&quot; after the experiences from the 1980s, which had their &quot;swan song&quot; in the area of the forum.
The first fear is one&#39;s own limitation of what may be built on.
&quot;To limit something always means to determine the next step&quot;, ie to go beyond it.
&quot;You have to think about new urban planning tools because the current ones [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real catastrophe.&quot;
Modol, who follows the question more closely, believes, simply, that the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana &quot;can be understood as a park, that towards Barcelona cannot&quot;, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;should not fall on deaf ears&quot;, although he is grateful to the municipality for having given his board the opportunity to work on this project &quot;from the very beginning&quot;. to contribute
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the safe haven that allows the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his &quot;doubts&quot; as to whether this technical profile warrants the multidisciplinary teams that have been set up (&quot;exactly that right,&quot; he says) &quot;We architects should only be a tool.&quot;
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, given the lack of a global view of Collserola in the tender conditions: &quot;16 cross-sectional competitions were tendered,&quot; he says, &quot;on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety.&quot;
At least in his case, this has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should definitely guarantee that the strip just above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length in such a way that there is a smooth transition between the city and green areas.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who is released
After 72 days of silence, the Commissioner of Casino Red cleared the Monterrey mayor&#39;s brother of the trial against him on alleged racketeering charges.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Commissioner of Casino Red pardoned him in the district&#39;s Second Criminal Court, which is conducting the trial of the Monterrey mayor&#39;s brother on racketeering charges.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money to allow the city council to stop the betting house from operating secretly approved.
Following the criminal complaint, prosecutors opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panic-stricken mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the officer of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the capital&#39;s Barrio Antiguo.
This is where he remained for 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the Ministerio Público official dismissed the offenses of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Center for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with a million pesos. On the other hand, he only stayed in the medium security wing for a few hours because of death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to attend the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza Municipal Jail.
On October 25, he was served with a detention order by the secretary of the district&#39;s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez. He found that after nearly two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonás of paying 1.5 million pesos to the betting house officials in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, Casino Red Commissioner Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to waive the mayor&#39;s brother, who will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público attached to the court, asked García Gómez if he had repaired the damage and which of the betting house&#39;s owners offered his forgiveness. However, the attorney withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. Also in the following no objections can be lodged against the process, moreover no compensation is demanded.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released following the hearing of the betting house&#39;s commissioner at around 3.50pm.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, drove to the San Nicolás de los Garza municipal jail to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case was being closed.
He also informed him of the judge&#39;s order for his immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome provides details of the plane crash that killed Government Secretary Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which the Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died, indicate that the helicopter with its entire crashed directly into the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
&quot;The fact that the propeller blades made contact with trees at an altitude of 25 meters, causing the helicopter to lose its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had made multiple ground contacts.&quot;
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for transporting personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during investigations in the area where the plane went down.
&quot;The search did not find any aircraft parts elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a dip of 7 to 30 degrees.
The priority at this time is to get the test results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, possibly even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the Estado Mayor Presidencial helicopter was flying at cruising speed on impact and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
&quot;This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact.&quot;
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to consider in the investigation:
visual flight:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight under the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew should have had adequate visibility during flight and on the ground.
weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at take-off. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some low clouds appeared.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew chose a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
impact point:
The coordinates of the impact and the helicopter&#39;s latest radar recording match. It is possible that there was neither a loss of control of the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight path before the impact.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had impacted from a straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft debris suggests that the helicopter struck the ground with its structure intact.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of the accident do not indicate any fire or explosion.
The latest assay results indicate multiple ground contacts.
During on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke down.
Some information indicates that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a meticulous search of an area beyond the cordoned-off area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, bolstering the belief that the intact aircraft structure had impacted the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find gene for obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Agency of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents entitled &quot;Genetics of childhood and adolescent obesity&quot; to which the genetic markers will be linked to be found with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, specializing in biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI clinic, explained that an interdisciplinary team was set up, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers became.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the IMSS sports fields in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation started at the Cuauhtémoc sports field (western México state) and has continued since October 8 at the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (eastern México state).
When the target of 500 to 600 study subjects is reached, the study will continue at the Independencia sports field (in the south of the Capital District) and will be completed in that of Morelos (in the North of the Capital District).
He explained that the aim of the study is to understand the factors and the role of genetics linked to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of World Diabetes Day, he said the goal is for 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 to complete nutritional questionnaires with parental consent and supervision.
You will also be asked questions about your level of physical activity and family history of the disease to control for risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further explained that on the said Saturdays, subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), checked their blood pressure and blood parameters such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes linked to childhood obesity ) would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that the research was being carried out in response to health workers&#39; concerns about the alarming weight gain in young people.
&quot;The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years the proportion of obese boys had increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Overweight had also increased dramatically,&quot; emphasized the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the people of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that the average Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes linked to diabetes and obesity .
More generally, he explained that the genetics of obesity is an inability to burn the excess energy (calories) we eat, so that it is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive screening of the children to determine whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even look for the presence of dark skin folds on the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-diabetes.
All information would be kept confidential and given to the parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors explain all measurement results to parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the television and using transport instead of short distances to walk.
The high calorie intake, that is, increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with high fat and protein intake, and the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at Mexico&#39;s UNAM University, is developing polymer-modified asphalts to make the mix more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Paying attention to the signs emanating from the pavement would not require repairing nearly 200,000 potholes when the rainy season hits the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (municipality of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and affirming that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt pavement is done properly, the number of potholes will be significantly reduced or even avoided altogether.
In his presentation &quot;Potholes from a Technical Perspective&quot; given at the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with an extremely hot climate, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the pavement and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - called asphaltenes - and the other part has a low molecular weight - called malthenes. Together they give the road surface its characteristic tough-elastic behavior.
Viscous behavior of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle.
&quot;This means that the durability of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes over the course of a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations,&quot; explained the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the majority of Mexico City&#39;s streets have flexible pavement made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include asphalt.
Between the top layers is a wearing course of asphalt, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then consolidated.
Every single stone of this wearing course has been bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the pavement.
&quot;If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be distributed even better,&quot; said the chemical engineer.
&quot;On top of the wearing course,&quot; he explained, &quot;a final layer is laid, called the base course, which is made up of tiny stones, ie sand that has also been bathed in asphalt.
Because this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require greater mechanical force than the wear layer and must create friction.
In addition, since this pavement receives and distributes most of the forces, the base course needs to be of adequate thickness and the material from which it is made needs to be maintained.
Weather conditions, particularly humidity and temperature variations, are other important factors to consider, above all water,&quot; he said, &quot;because it significantly affects the behavior of the wearing course.
When the terrain becomes wet, water seeps into the layer and has difficulty exiting. This causes softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is created,&quot; he said, &quot;the top layer is worn away first, and the wearing course is only degraded afterwards. But the damage is not instantaneous, it is a process that would need to be addressed through proper maintenance programs at the first sign.&quot;
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico&#39;s National Research System) explained that vehicle load is another important cause of pothole occurrence. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of road surface must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is followed in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and with which potholes can be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not receiving the Miss Colombia crown.
El Valle gets his 14th miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went away empty-handed when it came to awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winners&#39; podium, sporting a silver crown and the ribbon identifying her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained tonight in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already has 14 miss titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who almost held the crown in their hands had. Misses proclaimed include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque ( 1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a big favorite who had shown at every screening that she had what it took to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been voted Queen of the Police and Vogue&#39;s Mejor Rostro Jolie, titles shared by beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the Miss Colombia crown.
The first factor considered decisive in the jury&#39;s decision to nominate her First Miss is that she answered the question &quot;Which book influenced you the most and why?&quot; asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos had been asked, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
&quot;I read a lot, I&#39;m quite a believer in literature, I think it&#39;s a way of civilizing, ultimately I think the book that shaped my childhood the most was The Little Prince, a pretty deep one A book.
I am currently reading Crime and Punishment. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I&#39;m reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called &#39;Passions&#39;.
An answer that met with little approval, firstly because of the term `to civilize&#39; and secondly because she did not specifically explain how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after completing the ceremony, Melina explained feeling calm and happy with the outcome: &quot;The universe is wise, what must happen happens.
And for all people: Please read `The Little Prince&#39; a bit. It&#39;s a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite, the one who got all the plaudits and who had won all the prizes beforehand (Easter Gastronomy Contest, Audience Vote for Best Hand Tailored Costume and Reina Madre), &quot;the other contestants made jealous, which stressed out the queen, who couldn&#39;t shine on stage because of it.&quot;
And you could tell from her first performance in a bathing suit on the beach at the Hilton Hotel and from her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
While she performed confidently in both, she lacked the vigor and drive displayed by the Magdalena and Atlántico representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program &quot;Como en casa&quot; at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss &quot;shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not end up becoming the queen after all&quot;.
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Pageant.
There&#39;s a reason why, two days before the international jury was assembled, Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be involved in her country&#39;s social affairs.
&quot;Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that she had worked on projects before entering the competition,&quot; she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned with her derriere defects and the fibrosis noted in her stomach area. But this is contradictory because the jury selected her as a &#39;natural beauty&#39; candidate with a fit body, good dietary habits and responsible physical work.
The queens coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn&#39;t have the best physique, that there were better ones, &quot;but her abdominal fibrosis problem, which to be honest was barely noticeable for me, depressed her score at the last Day.&quot;
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine believes that the Valle del Cauca woman&#39;s fault was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
&quot;The surgeries are ok but Valle didn&#39;t know how to get them done properly.
Her body has never been her strong point, and this is where she had to pay.&quot;
Because of this award, which is being presented for the first time by the National Beauty Pageant, a cruel prediction was made after the performance in the swimsuit, which was to come true on the night. It was rumored that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize to keep her from enjoying the crown.
Whether that&#39;s true or not, the fact is that from today Melina begins her year of reign, not as queen but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions if nominated by the National Beauty Pageant .
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who escaped the crown despite her stunning performance for Cartagena.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a lophoscopist from the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor&#39;s Office (CTI) from Cali came in as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot; by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in CTI&#39;s department, on call this week was Eliazar González, a Puerto Tejada man who has worked in criminal investigations for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked in Chocó communities, where he often had to venture into the jungle for five days to reach the location of the bodies he was tasked with identifying.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, ie the palms and soles.
During the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
He flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca on Friday night.
He knew he was to identify two bodies, and there was a suspicion that one might be that of the man who had led the world&#39;s oldest guerrilla. Therefore, he should take Guillermo León Sáenz&#39;s tenfingerprint sheet (his real name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the corpse was with the medical examination, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, which did not at all resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don&#39;t lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a trowel, and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the corpse&#39;s fingerprints to those on the print sheet.
He had seen correctly: It was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of telling the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was in fact the head of the FARC.
In search of clues
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín in Cali, the tribute President Juan Manuel Santos gave Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against &quot;Cano&quot; was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with zero margin of error that can be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also assist in murder and robbery investigations and confirm the identities of those arrested.
When arrested, many criminals present false identification papers or do not have them.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that when he stole a piece of wall from a house, he had to rip it out because the thief had put his hand on that spot when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
&quot;Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting. But in this case, we were able to take the whole handprint and identify the criminal who participated in several thefts,&quot; he recalled.
Fingerprints can also be used to exonerate or incriminate murder suspects.
A body was recently found surrounded by liquor bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be a suspect, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
While this does not guarantee the killer is identified, it does link him to the location where the crime was committed.
A dactyloscopist at the CTI explained that &quot;fingerprints are taken from the object using chemical or physical reagents.&quot;
When they appear, a planting trowel or ribbon is used to take them away.
The fingerprints are then sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers,&quot; explained the CTI expert.
He said that not everything is as it is portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as all that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you carry out a corresponding comparison.
The &quot;outraged&quot; challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters huddled in tents in Zuccotti Square.
A majority complied with the eviction order and relocated to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement this Tuesday challenged New York authorities when, with a court order, they attempted to enter Manhattan Square again after being evicted at dawn and trying to find another seat on Manhattan Occupy the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain entry with a court order allowing the &quot;outraged&quot; to camp again in that spot. Meanwhile, another part of the movement complied with the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, making nine arrests.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court doesn&#39;t allow us to camp in the square, we&#39;ll gather somewhere else and continue the battle for the return to Zuccotti by legal means, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said the &quot;outraged&#39; response to the eviction of their camp, which was ordered directly by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, made it all the way to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order ordering the forcible eviction of the square and allowed the demonstrators to camp.
In addition, the &quot;outraged&quot; occupied a new park, located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, and property of Trinity Church is.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can&#39;t give exact numbers. He assured Efe news agency that he saw several handcuffed journalists among them.
The organization says hundreds of people gathered at the spot, along with a delegation of religious leaders to show their support for members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Square Zuccotti (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a judge&#39;s hearing, scheduled for this Tuesday, to analyze the legality of the dawn eviction.
Some of the protesters who were driven from the square carried and distributed photocopies of this judge&#39;s order. They even gave them to some police officers guarding the square, which prompted &quot;some small clashes,&quot; according to Bray, who reported that some police officers beat protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street and using &quot;laws passed after the occupation prohibiting protesters from using their tents and other items they had previously used return to the park.&quot;
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that the reopening of the square to the public and the demonstrators has been canceled as a result of this court order. He pointed out to the demonstrators that the city laws did not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags at this location.
The mayor personally defended the dawn eviction of Zuccotti Square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators &quot;broke the law.&quot;
Bloomberg said he ordered the site to be cleared because it &quot;had turned into a place where people came not to demonstrate, but to break the law and, in some cases, harm others.&quot; &quot;Some shops had received threats&quot; and the residents feared &quot;for their quality of life&quot;.
&quot;The dawn eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is fundamentally interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers,&quot; added the movement&#39;s spokesman, who accused the mayor of &quot;disrespecting freedom of the press.&quot;
Officials at Occupy Wall Street said they were considering organizing &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to mark the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17. to commemorate.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the Christmas TV show
She will appear on the TV program It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas on December 1 along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen&#39;s assistant on &#39;Home Improvement&#39;, lifeguard on &#39;Baywatch&#39;, rabbit on &#39;Playboy&#39;, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model on Canadian TV&#39;s Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
Private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson will join crooner (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1 on the TV program It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas, bringing a very special Virgin Mary to life becomes.
CTV today released images from the television program starring Anderson - who is also responsible for online distribution of a porn she made in which she appears with her ex-husband, &#39;Motley Crüe&#39; drummer Tommy Lee - as the Virgin Mary a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American descent who recently served as the host of Charlie Sheen&#39;s show &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth,&quot; appears as Baby Jesus.
CTV&#39;s Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentinian model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not immune to the controversy.
Bublé recently called North American Kim Kardashian a &quot;whore&quot; at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending the free fall spiral from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that culminated in a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan had experienced since World War II.
The Tokyo government&#39;s initial estimates put property damage at $300,000, a blow that appears to be slowing despite the troubled global economy.
After three quarters of falling, the July-September gross domestic product figures finally served to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at the annualized rate.
The figure for the second quarter - Japan&#39;s fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The rebound can be partially explained by the sale of machinery for rebuilding areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% drop for equity investments recorded from January to March, the first drop after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual turnaround in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or build new infrastructure.
Japan woke up thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, buoyed by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has turned to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the &quot;haven currencies&quot; for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and bleak US outlook, a privilege that has become a tombstone in accounts the export company burdens.
With a harder currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy relies on the health of the big tech producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak July-September results to the yen&#39;s appreciation.
As markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
&quot;One has to be alert to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very cheering.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that the brakes would be pulled at the largest economic powers.
Because it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which stands at 100, after falling eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be passed but Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With peripheral countries&#39; risk premiums soaring and uncertainty spreading, Greece is also getting further lost in the labyrinth leading out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek caretaker government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being supported by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed may be too short for them to be implemented, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democracia party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and would not, under any circumstances, withdraw his call for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19th.
&quot;The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit,&quot; assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programs to promote employment, reform disciplinary legislation for civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara&#39;s statement does not dispel doubts about his stance: &quot;We have made a commitment to support the interim government, but nothing else.&quot;
The Conservative leader went a step too far in his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs. He clarified that he would not endorse any commitment to comply with the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the implications of the papandreu referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that it would stand by its claim: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of Greece&#39;s main political parties &quot;a would not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible.
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors would return to Athens &quot;very soon&quot; to discuss with the new government &quot;what is needed for the payment of the sixth phase&quot; of 8000 million euros. , although there is no definitive date yet.
The Greek knot will have threads for a while yet.
Queen Sofía: &quot;These are instruments for progress and hope&quot;
The Queen stressed Spain&#39;s &quot;dominant&quot; position in relation to this type of funding
Spain &quot;has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance&quot;.
Queen Sofia of Spain recalled yesterday that in the last two decades Spain has become the second donor in the world to this means of international cooperation. Its &quot;essence&quot; is based on the fact that it is an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all of humanity based on trust in people&quot;.
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that this type of business would be &quot;absolutely essential&quot; in order to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and &quot;in particular the goal of increasing the number of people with an income have to live on less than a dollar a day, i.e. below the &quot;poverty line&quot;.
Spain &quot;continues to work&quot; on extending the network of beneficiaries &quot;to the furthest corners of the world and is carrying out this task responsibly&quot;, remarked Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which will be completed by Thursday lasts, &quot;the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women&quot; as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
&quot;We have had many successes&quot; and &quot;face many challenges.&quot;
The Microcredit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to kick off &quot;two fundamental goals&quot;.
The Queen said the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 10 million of these households to break the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus &quot;years ago&quot;, which Queen Sofia judges to be an &quot;act of justice and recognition&quot;.
She described the father of this financing vehicle as an &quot;admirable idealist dedicated to fighting poverty&quot; and whose work she had known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to see the lending strategy on the ground.
That experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington, and further meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. &quot;We have seen continuous development in all of them,&quot; explained the Queen, whose commitment to the project she told her yesterday earned the rating of &quot;Head of the Family&quot; in Valladolid and &quot;Advocate for the Poor&quot;.
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical Imperative&quot;
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is &quot;an ethical imperative&quot; for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie aid to periods of economic boom because it was a &quot;permanent commitment&quot;.
Jiménez believed that microcredit is a &quot;serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty&quot; and that the governments of the industrialized countries must now &quot;more than ever&quot; work according to criteria of solidarity and not allow the crisis to endanger solidarity victim falls.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the &quot;most important forms of development aid&quot;.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; of giving &quot;hope&quot; to &quot;marginalized&quot; people &quot;who always face closed doors&quot; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in welcome to a city that &quot;opens its gates infected by the spirit of solidarity&quot;.
The CDU proposes electing the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig passed without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally included in the programme, but came out on top in the autumn, particularly to please those activists who see government policy on Greece today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The proposal for the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes and was initially directed at Angela Merkel and a few hours later at Wolfgang Schäuble, left no doubts on the part of the three pro-European finance ministers.
The Chancellor&#39;s main idea - like the motion - carries the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is &quot;not less, but more Europe&quot;.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro&quot;.
For the chancellor, &quot;the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.&quot;
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the budget policy of the countries in the euro zone that would strengthen the control of the European Union; However, this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote &quot;to give Europe a face&quot;.
In any case, this is one of the proposed motions passed by the congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
To be sure, the 47 are unlikely to agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter and CDU leaders think they know that Nicolas Sarkozy agrees.
However, the milestone has been set.
Likewise, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB Executive Board according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen Germany&#39;s position.
The chancellor, who is intent on calming the atmosphere within her party, has therefore strengthened her links to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the Europe motion dedicates a paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel does not call France into the arena.
At least not directly.
Because this is a reminder that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sick leave fraud represent?
After family allowances, the UMP and the government are now tackling sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15th November to visit a family allowance fund and to make a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of combating social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
To accompany this attack, which emanates from a desire to put the economy to the test but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers&#39; sick leave.
Firstly, with budgetary goals: the government is targeting the introduction of a fourth day of sick leave before workers in the private sector are taken into account.
In plain English, this means that without the approval of the specific company, a sick employee would lose four days&#39; wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily Les Echos, threatens to provoke anger but would help raise 280 million euros.
And which would go hand in hand with another measure of a more symbolic nature: giving civil servants an unpaid day off in the event of illness (until now, unlike the three days off in the private sector, they have had no grace period).
While these issues are being debated, the majority are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absenteeism.
&quot;Controls will be much more important and, moreover, they will have to be reimbursed if they are requested,&quot; Xavier Betrand warned in front of the RTL microphone on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the ramifications of this report seem a little disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent activity in the field of sick leave.
In fact, since 2002 this has been the subject of constant observation and political offensives, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
For now, though, let&#39;s dwell on the nationwide digits.
According to the state health insurance company CNAM, more than 237 million euros in daily allowances were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, daily allowances represented 5% of health care expenditures in 2008, at 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% related to sick leave, ie 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were allowed an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that hides certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of sick leave calls in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% over.
Compared to their European neighbors, French workers are no more likely to be disabled than anywhere else.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Center for Research into Science (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenteeism rate (due to illness or other reasons) oscillated, ranging from 10% to 11% in France against 20 % and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave accounts for a negligibly small proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak level is reached here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sick leave that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (University of Education and Training for Technicians and Engineers) found, among 1.5 million checks, that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sick leave calls made, that is 37,050 cases, were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;. were.
Among the 1.2 million cases of sick leave lasting more than 45 days that were systematically controlled, 11% were &quot;inappropriate or unjustified&quot; cases, that is 132,000.
Altogether, that makes 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases out of several million workers who have claimed sick leave.
A figure that represents only a weak extent compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a July fact sheet on the issue, this represents between €9 billion and €15 billion in lost tax profits per year, ie more than the total cost of per diems, and thus far more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to cushion its economy.
This was announced on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of Parliament, adding that the 100 days granted by the Union to his government were not enough to complete this task.
&quot;In order to be able to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,&quot; said the Prime Minister in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament&#39;s vote of confidence on Wednesday.
Implementing the decisions taken at the October 27 Euro Summit is the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, since the country&#39;s participation in the eurozone is &quot;at stake&quot;, he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country&#39;s public deficit &quot;by 9%&quot; of today&#39;s gross domestic product by the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday approved measures already approved in an attempt to exit the debt crisis, but said his party would not agree to additional austerity measures.
&quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures,&quot; he said at a parliamentary meeting for his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to the targets of reducing the budget deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but was hostile to any policies that would stifle economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties of their support for the planned measures, replied Antonio Samaras that his word sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
According to a panel of experts, euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and physicians are working together on pain relief treatments to provide the best pain relief resources, even beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked to different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This panel recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where the choice is available, in patients considered capable of making such a choice.
As a start, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that &quot;medical end-of-life care in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to bring up the subject of death.&quot;
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Across the country, Quebec has the highest rate of in-hospital deaths, at 86%.
On the thorny issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report&#39;s authors come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it will not make any changes to the penal code related to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have similarly inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization eliminates abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide by incompetent or would entail non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are far more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized, as confirmed by Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference yesterday.
&quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Assisted suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it&#39;s clearly illegal here,&quot; explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Let&#39;s recall that according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, 85% of Canadians were already in favor of euthanasia, believing it allows those at the end of their life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia would not result in the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
With regard to people who have already practiced an assisted suicide, 41% of those questioned are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear when it comes to maintaining or withdrawing funds from patients, the report&#39;s authors said.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the penal code should state that the disposal of funds for which there has been a valid refusal should not be considered criminal.
The expert panel also urges that healthcare professionals should be trained to respect end-of-life weaning without fear of criminal prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and physicians are working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving tools, even beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the pain relief or end-of-life remedies already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the panel urges that they at least be considered, since they are not intended to reduce physical pain any more than euthanasia and relate to the same procedures .
reservations of other experts
Some experts in the healthcare legal field have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada&#39;s expert report.
Lawyer Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the attitude of the experts who signed the report as &quot;extreme&quot;, since it did not set any limits to the practice of euthanizing patients in the final phase.
&quot;This opens the door to a situation where anyone over the age of 18 who is suicidal can ask someone else to assist them with their suicide,&quot; said RA Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday .
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to prioritize individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are &quot;guidelines and obligations in a society&quot;.
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the report&#39;s conclusions, which she dubbed a &quot;pro-euthanasia manifesto&quot;.
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically challenges reports of the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down from power
Damascus denounces a &quot;plot&quot;.
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad&#39;s partisans demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry authorities.
The diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad&#39;s Syria, which, however, thanks to the support of Russia and rejects a &quot;conspiracy&quot; directed against the country, increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League expelled Syria, the European Union tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighbors, taking positions in favor of President Assad&#39;s resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the incumbent Arab prime minister who urged President Bashar al-Assad to &quot;resign from power&quot; in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of government power have already been killed.
&quot;If Bashar had his country&#39;s interests at heart, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era in Syrian political life,&quot; said the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC .
For his part, Turkey&#39;s chief diplomat, Ahmet Davutoglu, had complained that Turkey&#39;s attempts to mediate with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
&quot;Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot please their people must go,&quot; he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country on which Turkey has taken an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, the United States has welcomed the &quot;intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime&quot; as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
&quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly harsh stance on the repression in Syria,&quot; said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Department of State.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the Dar&#39;a region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH said.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed in &quot;exchanges of gunfire and heavy bombings around Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs.
Speaking at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim said the country was &quot;steering towards the end of the crisis&quot;.
Incidentally, he reacted emphatically to the Arab League&#39;s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considered to be a &quot;dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not back down,&quot; he added, assuring &quot;the plots hatched against Syria would fail.&quot;
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a &quot;protection mechanism for civilians&quot; and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to be sent to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favor of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he says is encapsulated in its &quot;paranoia&quot;.
An unscheduled new meeting of the league is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday branded the Arab League&#39;s decision as &quot;incorrect&quot; in a bid to avoid backing possible sanctions on Damascus, despite China&#39;s already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, Italy&#39;s future leader, has asked for a little more time for the markets to form his staff and implement a program that will require &quot;sacrifices&quot; to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday ahead of today&#39;s meeting between trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in parliament made up relatively strictly of outside technocrats.
&quot;Monti spoke of an important program with a number of victims,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, an MP from one of the many smaller parliamentary groups taking part in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
For his part, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, said he would wait until Friday for Mario Monti to submit a vote of confidence to Parliament to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The collusion will culminate in M. Monti&#39;s presentation of a list of items to be crossed out, which will no doubt range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday&#39;s nervousness on the stock and bond markets was taking its time.
In &quot;a democracy there are certain deadlines&quot; to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, noting that it is &quot;certain that the markets will be patient and understanding&quot;.
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by markets, but jitters had since returned, particularly after an unexpected fall in euro-zone industrial production in September.
The incumbent Prime Minister should set up a staff of mostly technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like &quot;politicians&quot; to be involved.
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive parliament&#39;s vote of confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his post, M. Monti has committed himself to working as a matter of urgency towards the goal of making Italy &quot;again a protagonist&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that &quot;even taking into account the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change&quot;.
In particular, the EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans launched in recent months, has requested new hardship measures.
Italy&#39;s boss Emma Marcegaglia, who is due to meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus &quot;because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit indicators&quot;.
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an &quot;epochal change&quot; in Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconism&quot;; the &quot;professor&quot; symbolizes the &quot;challenge of trustworthiness&quot; as well as a &quot;different Italy&quot;, according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has to pay 200 billion euros in government bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran&#39;s nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator capable of being used with a nuclear weapon, a US NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) based the finding on the recent report by the International Agency for Nuclear Safety (AIEA) and other documents originating from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA announced its &quot;serious concern&quot; about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; to Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to ISIS&#39;s close study of AIEA documents, Danilenko, who was born in 1934, had apparently worked at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals) for over three decades from the early 1960s and was involved in the explosive production of synthetic diamonds.
He is said to have left the center in 1989 or 1991 to set up a company in Kiev that produces &quot;nano-diamonds&quot;.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he worked on an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned &quot;strong evidence that Iran&#39;s development&quot; of &quot;a nuclear explosives system&quot; had been aided by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly skilled in the technique but beyond, a state official told the agency , have spent his entire professional career working on this technology directly in the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin.&quot;
Anti-Islamic crimes and offenses have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses directed against Muslims rose 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes either declined slightly or increased only slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase, while a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews, and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of &quot;hate-motivated crimes&quot; rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% racially motivated crimes and 20% religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
&quot;After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes on the rise again,&quot; the human rights organization Human Rights First said. &quot;The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant,&quot; the organization added in a statement.
&quot;Human Rights First has long maintained that violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crime, should be considered a gross violation of human rights law,&quot; added Paul Legendre, an organization officer.
&quot;The American government can and should do more to combat these abuses,&quot; he added, adding that this could be done by improving police stance on &quot;hate crimes.&quot;
&quot;Hate crime&quot; is presented in American federal law as a legacy of the era of civil rights struggles.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence based on race, colour, religion or descent and now also includes crimes related to sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is becoming more like Facebook
Microblogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in its platform&#39;s presentation, notably to allow its users to monitor the activities of those who follow their posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new &quot;Activity&quot; tab and a different &quot;Name&quot; enable more legible live tracking of the activities of other &quot;Twitterers&quot;, the Internet users whose messages (&quot;Tweets&quot;) you follow and who follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether they allow their messages to be tracked, whether they subscribe to new posts, favorite certain messages, etc.
Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP that this new Twitter menu offer was tested &quot;with a small percentage of users&quot; before its general Internet distribution on Monday &quot;in August&quot;.
Twitter was known for its non-instinctive functioning, tipped with somewhat esoteric wording (RT to reference another person&#39;s post). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s&#39;ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain &quot;tweets&quot; over the Internet.
&quot;It&#39;s useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @jemb123.
&quot;The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter,&quot; said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a &quot;Golden Budget Rule&quot; into the constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a &quot;golden budget rule&quot; in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also a possible demotion by rating agencies in the top Austria&#39;s credit rating (AAA) to avoid.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced the outcome of the Council of Ministers, even though the Austrian public debt is at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below the level of debt in countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If Austria&#39;s solvency hadn&#39;t suddenly dropped from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year,&quot; argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also agrees to a demand made by the Brussels summit of the member states of the euro zone on October 26: At that time, the heads of state and government would have to include the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance in the constitution or through the enactment of an equivalent one required by law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the &quot;German model&quot; since Germany was the first European country to introduce such a &quot;rule&quot; into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) every year, from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, while the regional states as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate household debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
strong yen
Noda threatens to intervene again in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in currency markets if the yen continues to appreciate.
&quot;Should we detect excessive volatility&quot; in the exchange rate of the yen, &quot;we will intervene as we did last time,&quot; M. Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen had recovered close to historic levels that forced Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
On the day, Tokyo had sold the yen against the dollar massively in a bid to lower the Japanese currency value, which is about to hit a new high since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has regularly risen above it, bolstered by buying from investors who view the yen as a &quot;safe haven&quot; during these uncertain times of global economic downturn and European debt crisis.
The dollar slipped below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen bar, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flash in the pan of Japanese currency is hurting the archipelago&#39;s exports by increasing the cost of &quot;Made in Japan&quot; products and reducing the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad as they convert them into local currency.
&quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast),&quot; stresses M. Noda, who fears that the yen&#39;s appreciation could kill the weak recovery in the bud.
The world&#39;s third economic powerhouse has regained traction for the first time this year, with growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, thanks to the surge in exports and the consumption of households &quot;sealed&quot; by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the appreciation of the yen does not reflect &quot;Japan&#39;s economic fundamentals&quot;.
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has indicated that the BoJ has already taken &quot;appropriate measures&quot;, saying that no further currency easing is expected on Wednesday.
At its most recent meeting in late October, the central bank increased its government bond purchases by 5 trillion yen ($48 billion) to repay the 55 trillion yen (519 billion Euro) of collateral it had spent on various financial asset purchases to boost the liquidity market flood.
Euro zone:
Interest rates are skyrocketing, stock markets are retreating
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
Stock markets, still worried about the stability of the Eurozone, drift a little more into negative territory this Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris at 10 a.m., the CAC lost 1.4% and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
&quot;Global equity markets continue to shed some of their recent gains on renewed tensions over government bond yields in the troubled euro zone.
&quot;Investors are nervous and all too aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, as quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is suffering from renewed fears among European capacity market participants that the debt crisis will persist, closed down 0.7%.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and trading will remain within a limited range of variation until investors have evidence that the situation has stabilised,&quot; estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management .
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro zone is hurting the single currency, which continued its bearish run into Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
As of 10 am, the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to stockbrokers, it fell after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s party, which met in Congress on Monday, approved a motion that specifically provides for the possibility for troubled countries to leave the eurozone without simultaneously to leave the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% mark.
Lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while that on Spanish bonds matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investors&#39; fears.
Future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time for the markets to restore Italy&#39;s situation, which was threatened by paralysis from the debt burden.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the October 27 euro zone summit was &quot;the main task&quot; of his government.
Spain is in the markets&#39; sights as the country&#39;s general elections take place on Sunday.
The interest rate gap (&quot;spread&quot;) between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of Eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France posted household consumption-led economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the bearish figures for the second quarter, namely with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it&#39;s the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection for the entire euro zone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
energy policy:
Facts should triumph over dogma
If there is one topic that should not be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or because of emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to use an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the full economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinions on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving the demand for electricity to double by 2050, lest an enormous proportion of the world&#39;s population be without a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to be able to continue producing electricity steadily, without forgetting the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
As a result, Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to the need to find a substitute source that can be substituted, nor in Switzerland, which intends to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
For its part, after Fukushima, the United States decided to add another unit to its park by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which had been shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a role model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased dependency on Russia for energy due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives food for thought.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the largest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill that is 40% higher than our French households.
Since the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness in the globalized economy and a guarantee of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore entail a sharp increase in the price of energy, making the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
Polls have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as they are to the principle of this source of energy.
Let&#39;s remember that our country&#39;s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink further and further.
What electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years when its manufacturer&#39;s demise is inevitable?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is no such thing as a miracle cure for generating electricity, just as there is no devil&#39;s work.
The low-CO2 solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security agency that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the Flamanville building.
Their work teams, renowned for their professionalism, are obsessed with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; it took place without any consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor design and inexcusable human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented natural disasters that claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident just as it did after the previous two.
The fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that allows it to withstand such phenomena.
Since building a nuclear power plant is considered desirable among electrical engineers, halting construction in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, giving them free rein to usurp the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is imperative and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overburdening of police, judiciary and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a &quot;country of human rights&quot;, as France had dubbed itself.
Recently, official harassment of foreign students had dominated newsreels, with the interior minister casually announcing (see Libération May 23) that France &quot;does not need talent, masons or waiters from abroad&quot;.
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million migrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country&quot;, on the left by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990, France &quot;could not absorb all the poverty in the world&quot;.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
Fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 by both right and left.
Both camps saw the immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the level of generosity one is willing to show towards immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities that point out that development based on partnership makes it possible to solve our &quot;migration problems&quot;.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have electoral implications; however, it is economically expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent work summarizing the latest evidence on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) , there is a broad consensus among specialists regarding the positive influence of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would sap growth and damage the labor market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the local workforce, especially the lower-skilled ones, by putting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than native wage workers, as they tend to work in sectors that are underutilized.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that are unattractive to local wage workers, while the more skilled immigrants work in dynamic sectors where education is not matched with the labor supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between natives and migrants also creates a positive effect of immigrant influx on wages and domestic labor markets.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigrant tide would produce an implied long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without considering the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants is conducive to idea generation and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to the social systems, averaging around 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labor Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 will on average make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over their lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing points of intersection &quot;with the teeth&quot; when he took up his mandate.
However, these said teeth, designed to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, wrote throughout the 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece had endured.
Some might have believed that exercising the right to vote, and doing so in the most direct way possible, was enough to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon &quot;the little one&quot; that it was a question of a mental attitude.
Universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an &quot;instrument of oppression&quot;, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a judiciary.
The crisis in Europe that we are going through is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a political and democratic crisis.
The change of heart of the Greek true-false referendum would have been doubly revealing in this regard: that of the need for a vigorous return of politics, but also that of the disturbing sense of its impossibility, of its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the frontlines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by urging the success of the national referendum, which was organized according to necessity and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European autocrat or a blindfolded leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want a cleaver, but a collective task, with every right, calm and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we don&#39;t know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis and it is in Europe.
It is all of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, suffering from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated on an international level.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - when it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each and every one of the nations that are part of it.
The urgency is to restore leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is up to the whole, whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, break free from the markets and build a future through investment.
Getting out of the crisis is conditional on decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without certainty leading us to our doom.
Long opposed to this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now pushing European economic leaders to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as citizens envision - would be yet another folly and dead end.
We must undertake a new stage in European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;create&quot; republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
&quot;Contactless&quot; chip cards are becoming common property
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris with an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (debit cards, SIM card telephones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which makes it possible to pay for public transport or purchases simply by holding the card up to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment after long lagging behind Asia Pacific.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been distributed.
However, hypermarkets are making steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speeds, it is now necessary for banks to provide their customers with these cards.
&quot;Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically issuing their customers with bank cards equipped with a contactless chip,&quot; announced Gérard Nebouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
However, this is only the first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A tiny percentage of devices are currently equipped with the necessary NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to carry out these transactions.
&quot;You are in default&quot;.
&quot;But they should at least see some real improvement next year.&quot;
&quot;We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE runs a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments by cell phone.
Terrorist front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relationship between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now &quot;obtained certainty&quot; about this.
&quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the relationship between the intelligence agencies indicate a clear cooperation,&quot; he said without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January brought interfaces to light.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped by Aqmi supporters in a restaurant in Niamey, are said to have been killed the following day, at the same time as several of their kidnappers, during an operation carried out by French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene.
terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls made leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that was the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man believed to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
&quot;This is progress, but one must undoubtedly await clearer evidence before one can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s conceivable, though.&quot;
&quot;It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outside and that it is becoming increasingly active,&quot; Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo mitigates.
In recent months, these &quot;support services&quot; have become more and more obvious in their course, as well as the speeches and the modes of operation of Boko Harem, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that bear the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since then pressured Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be an Illuminati community that deserves no special attention.
Fast success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means &quot;Western education is a disgrace&quot; in Haoussa - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and claims strict observance of Sharia law, while its affiliated activists fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in intensifying their attacks on the commissariats.
However, the reaction on the part of Abuja is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, 800 dead are counted.
The captured Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the cult becomes increasingly radical and abandons its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an assassination attempt in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing at Abuja&#39;s secure police headquarters - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes the number one international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is said to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria and Somalia, has worried all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi have occupied Mali and Niger, al-Shabaab&#39;s Somalis are operating in Kenya, the Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned about the Boko Harem and said he was ready &quot;to share all leads&quot;.
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in oversimplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say silly, ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential nominees, voters might almost get that impression.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their cronies have repeated their thunderous declarations and statements on foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Slogans - often unsupported in any way - are being thrown about China, Iran and aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the top contender for nominating the &quot;Grand Old Party,&quot; threatened to summon the Chinese to the WTO and &quot;currency manipulation&quot; - a leading issue in an America fretted by the exodus of entire industries to Asia - to accuse.
Stupid if this is to imply starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who appears to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost choked on his emotionally insinuating demeanor.
He had called for a solid but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama&#39;s current position).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan&#39;s likeness
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions to halt the nuclear program failed.
&quot;If I&#39;m elected, I&#39;ll stop Iran,&quot; he said.
&quot;If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb&quot;.
He has also promised increased military aid to Israel and accused Obama of failing to meet obligations to that partner.
For his part, entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, displays a shameful ignorance of the files.
He recently called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing is &quot;trying to develop a nuclear power&quot; - seemingly ignoring the fact that China has possessed military nuclear weapons since 1964!
For his part, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to use the US army in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
You are a long way from John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current opponents for the presidency counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and despite everything won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself is an amateur and had to put water in his wine when it came to anti-terror issues.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him a reputation for weakness.
However, this hostility is not quite so casual.
The population appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to slackening.
And Obama more appropriately surprises by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and directly connects Western Europe with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is designed to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and splendor.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline on the Baltic Sea coast, to the sound of an orchestra and at a gourmet buffet, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte symbolically turned the control of the valve that feeds Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through an initial 1,224 km pipeline connecting the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-West Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of all France&#39;s consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line on the same route is already being hinted at.
For Gazprom, the timely and on-time completion of this enormous structure looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
In fact, the Nord Stream pipeline will enable gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any routing through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
Because of this, these two countries are losing a little of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, had not shied away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline to a &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot; linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the approval of this Russian project.
However, this is at the cost of weakening European energy, since the project has created a breach between western and eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to impose its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, gas-consuming and dwindling Western countries.
&quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way&quot;, confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are also political and economic aspects are important.
All this explains the broad smiles of the many Gazprom managers in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this long-distance gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with a concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed at a depth of about 200 m.
During its construction, minefields dating back to the Second World War had to be avoided.
&quot;Around hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,&quot; said Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is uninterrupted along its entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was envisaged off the coast of Sweden, but those responsible for the project refrained from doing so because the Swedes were not very keen on seeing a Russian state company settling off their shores on a permanent basis.
&quot;In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute,&quot; specified Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the long-distance gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, since the welds were estimated to resist a leak of one per 100,000 years.
State surveillance of the gas pipeline is provided both by an underwater robot controlled from a seagoing vessel for external observation purposes and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
Shaped like a cigar, one meter in diameter, it is inserted inside the pipe and propelled by the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the pipeline at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device, upon arrival, provides the most accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without requiring even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point and 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E.ON and BASF are also affiliated here (each with 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (each with 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased the company&#39;s entire gas transmission capacity under a 20-year renewable contract.
&quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,&quot; specified Jens Muller.
The financing of the long-distance gas pipeline construction was secured 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are confident that they will recover their expenses since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The long-distance gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-forested stretch of coast near Lubmin.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet port.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German long-distance gas pipelines.
As of last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas every passing hour.
At full capacity this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to bring a new style to writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black square cover, elastic strap, off-white pages, as if aged with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to bring a distinguished design notebook onto the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company&#39;s consultant, is in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton varnish used, for example, for upholstered benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine has revived an ancient and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create an identikit of buyers because the notebook appeals to business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which started out with 12 employees, now has over 100 employees and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on websites like Fnac, in small boutiques in city centers and knows how to assert its identity.
&quot;We have followed the zeitgeist and its new need for writing, despite the rise of email,&quot; explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: recently the brand launched an exposition called &quot;Detour (detour) &quot; in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard print cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and knew how to diversify its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer sleeves... The brand has the full range of items.
A success that brings envious people to the scene: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today&#39;s Syntegra Capital, thus opening a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why does unemployment among disabled workers remain so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The &quot;15th week of work for the disabled&quot; begins today.
Despite a purposeful public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% unemployment for the entire population.
Daunting?
&quot;No,&quot; says Éric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt association, which organizes the &quot;Week of work for the disabled&quot;.
&quot;The progress made in fifteen years is significant.&quot;
&quot;Back then, the unemployment rate wasn&#39;t twice, it was three times as high.&quot;
&quot;Nevertheless, there is still a lot to do.&quot;
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they can get a job.
It affects the elderly more often: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have low levels of qualifications: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled versus 38% overall.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter the workforce and that &quot;is at the heart of the problem,&quot; according to Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
What remains is the unspoken, the attitudes that are certainly, but slowly, evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for La Cité magazine said the managers surveyed had &quot;a low level of knowledge about the disabled&quot; that was &quot;overrepresented by people in wheelchairs, the mentally or intellectually disabled&quot;.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to meet the employment target of 6% disabled workforce set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which are from 2008, refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
&quot;We&#39;re now at around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the organization charged with collecting contributions from companies that don&#39;t comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of &quot;fee-paying&quot; establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid in, between 2007 and 2011, numerically from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The law of 2005, which provides for increases in contributions, put a lot of pressure on companies, explained Pierre Blanc.&quot;
&quot;But this improvement also expresses a real realization, particularly in the large corporate groups.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: &quot;What luck&quot;
Even before they faced the &quot;blue Tuesday evenings&quot; (8:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden the pleasure that the friendly brought them.
It would be going too far to say that there was a collusion between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium at the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well have made peace.
Five months after his forward&#39;s spirited gesture against Turkey, the Belgium coach had received nothing but personal praise.
&quot;I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian&quot;.
&quot;I want to look ahead,&quot; assures the native of Liller.
As for the contrast between his portrayal at club and national level: &quot;It&#39;s a unit, that justifies everything.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m in Lille all year round, which isn&#39;t the case in Belgium&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s time for me to start&quot;.
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought on Friday night against Romania for the match against France, to finally &quot;shine&quot;.
But without omitting the note of &quot;enjoyment&quot;.
He has been cheering on the French national team since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always had support,&quot; he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to reinforce the &quot;unique&quot; character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there,&quot; he recalls.
&quot;We just crossed paths&quot;.
&quot;To play against them is very lucky!&quot;
For his part, Leekens tossed &quot;pride&quot; with good nature.
&quot;The Pride of Hosting a Gala Match&quot;.
&quot;Proud&quot; also to confirm - in his capacity as &quot;neighbours&quot; - that France &quot;have again become a team at a very high level&quot;, a little more than a year after the Knysna trauma.
&quot;Laurent Blanc did a damn good job,&quot; he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be absent from the next European Championship, the technician sees himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team)... bound for Brazil in 2014.
&quot;We little Belgians make it big,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are planning something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;ll notice that in the upcoming games.&quot; The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento&#39;s Portuguese team is looking forward to the second leg against Bosnia (10:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the first leg, both teams lacked objectivity.
&quot;At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country.&quot;
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has not the slightest doubt that &quot;La Selecçao&quot;, his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
Indeed, for Portugal, that means just 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play and an opponent to sack, and that is Bosnia.
Considering Friday&#39;s first leg (0-0) in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the die is not yet cast.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but the side were unable to put the all-important stamp on the game to take the pressure off.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but it comes with a certain risk as we didn&#39;t score an away goal.&quot;
At home, however, in their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident they can pull through in front of a crowd that is bound to be just as keen to see the game, even though the game was of course announced as &#39;very close&#39;, he said the optimistic but clear-eyed Bento.
&quot;We&#39;re expecting a very close match but we&#39;re fully confident that we can prevail,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance of being part of the 2012 European Championships,&quot; said Carlos Queiroz&#39;s successor.
Friday&#39;s draw in Bosnia will force the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but it comes with some risk as we didn&#39;t score an away goal,&quot; Bento said.
&quot;We will play against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians right from the start &quot;to give them no time to think&quot;.
A good idea, provided that this time it is implemented.
