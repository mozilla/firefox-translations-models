This is James Risen.
You may know him because he was a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly published that the NSA had illegally tapped American phones.
But it&#39;s another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally gave Iran designs for a nuclear bomb.
If this sounds crazy, read it.
It&#39;s an incredible story.
But you know who didn&#39;t like the chapter at all?
The US Government.
For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating Risen and asking him to identify his alleged sources.
Along the way, he became a symbol of the government&#39;s pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
According to the First Amendment, the media has the right to publish classified information.
But it is impossible to exercise this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identities of the brave who disclose it.
So when the government came to Risen&#39;s door, he did what many brave reporters have done before him: he refused, saying he&#39;d rather go to jail.
So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, despite years of stating it was essential to their case, the government&#39;s demands on Risen were dropped.
The reason: In the age of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and getting Risen to testify, his digital footprints might as well do it for him.
And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly obtained his phone records,
as well as his email details, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even travel records listing his flights.
Amidst this information, they found evidence they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen&#39;s alleged source.
Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.
President Obama pledged to protect whistleblowers when he took office. But instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him combined.
Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially since the government keeps too much of their work classified.
Since 9/11, almost every national security article has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
So we&#39;re jeopardizing the public relations work that the First Amendment is designed to protect, because the government has more and more power to spy on everyone.
But just as technology allows the government to circumvent reporters&#39; rights, the press can also use technology to better protect its sources.
And they can do it from the moment they make contact, rather than afterwards, on the witness stand.
Today there is communication software that didn&#39;t exist when Risen wrote his book, and it&#39;s far more secure than regular email or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower submission system originally developed by internet celebrity, the departed Aaron Swartz, and today advanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, like this one at the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.
So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and much of the information it would request would not be available in the first place.
However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new spy technologies that endanger us all.
It&#39;s up to us to ensure that it&#39;s not just techies like Edward Snowden who have an opportunity to expose wrongdoing. It&#39;s just as important that we protect the next whistleblower
who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental worker who sounds the alarm about Flint&#39;s contaminated water. Or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were made not just for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights.
Thanks.
[On April 3, 2016, the biggest leak in history was released.] [The Panama Papers reveal that the rich and powerful] [have stashed vast amounts of money in tax havens.] [What does that mean?] [We asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we broke news of a leak of 11 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca
The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.
We get a glimpse of how clients, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, &quot;Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?&quot;
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.
This has already led to the first very direct consequences.
Iceland&#39;s prime minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has shell companies in tax havens.
A $2 billion trail is said to lead to Russia&#39;s President Vladimir Putin via a close childhood friend, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of rich people and others out there nervously awaiting the next release and the next revealed documents.
Now that sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems weep far from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should that concern us?
But the truth is, when the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, that means less money for essential public services like healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects us all.
For my organization, Global Witness, these disclosures are phenomenal.
Around the world, media and political leaders are debating how secret tax havens are being used by the few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we&#39;ve been debating and exposing for a decade.
I think a lot of people find this whole world very confusing and it&#39;s hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine it like a matryoshka doll.
So you have a company within another company, within another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these entities.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement, tax authorities, journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on.
I also find it interesting that there is less coverage of this matter in the US.
Presumably because there have been no prominent Americans involved in these revelations, this scandal.
Now it&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens.
But because of the way these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would see many more cases and examples that have US connections.
In fact, in some US states, it takes less information, giving less information, to form a business than it does to get a library card.
This type of opacity in the US has allowed school district officials to rip off school children.
It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.
It&#39;s this type of behavior that affects us all.
Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out what all of this looks like in practice.
How does it actually work?
So we sent an undercover officer into the offices of 13 Manhattan law firms.
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
We were really shocked that all but one attorney made suggestions to our investigator on how to move his money.
These were all preliminary talks. None of these lawyers took us on as clients, and of course no money was handed over to anyone in the process. Yet it shows the problem with this system.
It&#39;s also important not to think of these as isolated cases.
This isn&#39;t about a single attorney who made suggestions to our undercover cop.
It&#39;s not about a single leader caught up in a scandal.
It&#39;s how the system works that perpetuates corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.
And to do that, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.
This may all sound very gloomy, as if there is nothing we can do about it; as if nothing had ever changed; like there will always be the rich and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I can definitely see that things have started to change.
In the past few years, we&#39;ve seen pushes toward more transparency about company owners.
The issue received political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron at the 2013 G8 summit in Northern Ireland.
Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.
One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.
Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both chambers of Parliament, but it is not making the progress we would like to see.
We&#39;d really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge glimpse into the world of tax havens, being used as a tool to create more transparency in the US and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their real identities behind shell companies.
We need business leaders to stand up and say, &quot;A lack of transparency is not good for business.&quot;
We need political leaders who recognize the problem and work to legislate to end this type of lack of transparency.
Together we can finally end the lack of transparency that still allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.
This is the story of how I once almost got kidnapped and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
The day after I graduated from design school, I did a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was on a road trip across the country. After that he would join the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.
It was getting late. I got tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him, &quot;Where are you sleeping tonight?&quot;
He made the whole thing worse: &quot;I don&#39;t know yet.&quot;
And I was like, &quot;Oh man!
What do I do now?&quot;
Who does not know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I just met him! He says he&#39;s going to join the Peace Corps, but I don&#39;t know if he actually plans to. I don&#39;t want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
That&#39;s a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say, &quot;I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room.&quot;
A voice in my head said, &quot;Er, what?&quot;
Then at night I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling and thinking, &quot;Oh man! What did I get myself into?
A total stranger sleeps in my living room.
What if he&#39;s crazy?&quot;
I got so scared that I got out of bed, tiptoed to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn&#39;t crazy at all.
We are still in touch.
The artwork he bought from me hangs in his classroom today. He&#39;s a teacher now.
That was my first experience as a host. It completely changed my perspective.
Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Looting people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.
Fast forward two years later...
I&#39;m unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is moving out and the rent is going up.
I found out that there was a design conference in town at the time. All hotels were fully booked.
I believe creativity can turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate, Brian Chesky: &quot;Brian, I&#39;ve been thinking about how we could make some extra money. Our apartment is becoming a designer bed and breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, WiFi and a desk included , plus a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!&quot;
We created a website and founded &quot;Airbed and Breakfast&quot; [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on a wooden floor for 20 dollars.
They loved it and so did we.
I&#39;m sure our ham and cheese omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured the whole city with them. As we said goodbye to our last guest and the door slammed shut, Brian and I stared at each other.
Did we just discover that we could make new friends and pay our rent at the same time?
Things got rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if it could be turned into a business concept.
Here&#39;s how we presented ourselves to investors: &quot;We want to create a website where people will publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms you close the doors to when you have visitors.
They can then use the Internet to invite complete strangers to stay with them.
This is going to be the next big thing!&quot;
We waited for the rocket to ignite.
But she didn&#39;t.
No one in their right mind would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people&#39;s homes.
Why?
Because we all learned as kids that strangers are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you reflect on the things you are good at. We could design.
At art school we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it&#39;s the total experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design achieve something like that?
Is it possible to create trust with design?
I want to give you a taste of the level of trust we were aiming for.
It&#39;s a 30 second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up if you&#39;re ready.
Pick up your cell phone.
Now I would like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to the person seated on your left.
That slight pang of panic you&#39;re feeling now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.
Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.
Not only can visitors read your SMS, they can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to hold a stranger&#39;s unlocked phone in your hands?
Most feel responsible.
That&#39;s how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.
This is the only reason our company can exist.
Just so, who actually has Al Gore&#39;s cell phone?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for President?
You can now return the cell phones.
You have now experienced the kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we changed a small detail in this experiment?
What if your neighbor first introduced himself by his name; if he had told where he came from, the names of his dog or his children?
Imagine having 150 reviews all saying, &quot;He&#39;s really, really good at holding unlocked phones!&quot;
How would you feel if you had to give up your cell phone?
Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust significantly.
At the beginning we did a few things wrong.
It was difficult for people to leave negative reviews.
Ultimately, we decided to wait for both host and guest to submit their reviews before posting them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We did a study with Stanford. We examined how likely people are to trust each other based on how similar they are in terms of age and location.
Unsurprisingly, we trust the people most who are most like us.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It gets interesting when you add a person&#39;s reputation -- in our case, through reviews.
If you have fewer than three reviews, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation outweighs similarities.
So, the right design can help us overcome some of our ingrained preferences.
We also learned that trust depends on how much you reveal about yourself.
Here you can see the reactions to a guest&#39;s first message.
If you don&#39;t say enough, such as &quot;Hi!&quot;, you&#39;re more likely to get no response.
If you say too much, such as: &quot;I have problems with my mother&quot; -- -- the request is also more likely not to be accepted.
So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. B. &quot;Great artwork in your apartment! I&#39;m vacationing with my family.&quot;
How can design create this degree of openness?
We use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text. We also give tips on which topics you should write something about.
Our whole company is built on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudice against strangers.
What we didn&#39;t expect was the large number of people who were more than willing to shed these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.
You can see three things.
First: incredibly lucky.
Second: the tireless work of our team.
Third, a need that had not previously been met.
Business is going very well for us right now.
Of course, there are times when things don&#39;t go smoothly.
There were guests who celebrated parties without permission or ransacked apartments.
Hosts left guests out in the rain.
At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. All calls came straight to my cell phone.
I was on the front line when trust was broken.
There&#39;s nothing worse than those calls. It hurts just thinking about it.
The disappointment you hear in the voices of the callers was and will always be our biggest motivation to keep improving.
Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays arranged, only a fraction ever had a problem.
Because people rightly trusted each other.
When trust works, wonderful things can happen.
One of our guests was vacationing in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the needed surgery!
Here is his assessment:
&quot;Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary work.
The area is beautiful and has enough hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save your life even though they don&#39;t really know you.
They drive you to the hospital in their own car when you die and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don&#39;t want you to feel lonely, they drop off books.
They even let you stay longer without charging the extra nights.
I highly recommend it!&quot;
Of course, not every stay is like this.
But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the sharing economy.
When I first stumbled across this term, I asked myself:
How does the idea of sharing fit with money transactions?
This is an economic trade.
But just calling it the &quot;rental industry&quot; doesn&#39;t do it justice.
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People reveal a part of themselves and that changes everything.
Traveling these days is like fast food. It&#39;s efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
But what if travel was a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if every place you visited had a group of locals waiting to fill you up and take you on a pub crawl to neighborhoods you&#39;ve never heard of;
or if you could learn to cook from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we designed homes from the ground up to be shared?
How would that look?
What if cities embraced the idea of sharing?
I envision cities that give us society and connections instead of loneliness and isolation.
This project has already started in South Korea&#39;s capital Seoul. Lots of parking lots owned by the government
were offered to local residents. students looking for a place to stay
were given to people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs have been started
to be able to finance new start-ups in the sharing economy. Tonight, through our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will host or host a stranger.
So the idea doesn&#39;t seem as crazy as we&#39;ve been taught it to be.
We didn&#39;t reinvent the wheel.
Hospitality was there before.
There were similar websites before us.
So why did ours work?
Luck and timing aside, we realized that with the ingredients of trust, you can find the right design.
Design can help us to overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I find that amazing
downright overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use design for next.
Thanks.
What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? An expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay in airport security.
That is indeed true.
I don&#39;t blame you for your negative impressions.
This is how the media portrays people who look like me.
A study found that 80% of media coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show: Americans think that most of them don&#39;t know any Muslims.
Presumably people don&#39;t talk to their Uber drivers.
For all those who have never met a Muslim: It&#39;s great to meet you.
I tell you who I am.
I&#39;m a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with extra cream.
I&#39;m an introvert
a wannabe fitness fanatic,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga sings because, baby, I wasn&#39;t born that way.
I have decided to do this.
When I was 17, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose to wear the hijab, my head covering.
My feminist friends were horrified: &quot;Why are you suppressing yourself?&quot;
The funny thing was, back then it was a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to conform to a perfect and unattainable ideal of beauty.
I didn&#39;t just passively embrace my parents&#39; faith.
I wrestled with the Koran.
I read it, pondered, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur&#39;an.
The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.
I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever had the feeling that someone sees you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves you?
That&#39;s how it feels.
I later married and, like all good Egyptians, began my career as an engineer.
I later had a child after my marriage and was basically living the &quot;Egyptian-American Dream&quot;.
Then came that awful morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where you were.
I was sitting in my kitchen, having finished my breakfast, looking at the screen and saw the word &quot;Breaking News&quot;.
There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned to outrage.
Why should one do such a thing?
I changed the TV channel and heard: &quot;...Muslim terrorists...,&quot; &quot;...in the name of Islam...,&quot; &quot;...of Middle Eastern descent...,&quot; &quot;...jihad... ,&quot; &quot; ... bombs Mecca!&quot;
Oh my God.
Not only has my country been attacked, but in an instant the actions of others turned me from a citizen to a suspect.
On the same day we had to drive across the Midwest to move to a new city and start graduate school.
I remember how -- as we drove in silence -- I crouched as low as I could in my seat, and for the first time I feared being recognized as a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night, in a new city that felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, saw and read the warnings from the national Islamic organizations saying: &quot;Be vigilant&quot;, &quot;Be careful&quot;, &quot;Stay in well-lit areas&quot;, &quot;Do not gather&quot;.
I stayed inside all week.
Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.
And again the warnings were: &quot;Don&#39;t go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target.&quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage.
The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were thought to be Muslim being dragged outside and punched.
There really were arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: We should stay at home.
But something didn&#39;t feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
I caught people&#39;s anger at the terrorists.
Imagine! I was angry too.
It&#39;s not easy having to explain yourself all the time.
I don&#39;t mind questions, I love questions.
It&#39;s the allegations that are tough.
In fact, today we can hear people saying, &quot;There&#39;s a problem in this country -- it&#39;s called Muslims.
When are we going to get rid of them?&quot;
Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.
They speak of my church as if it were a tumor in America&#39;s body.
The only question is: are we malignant or benign?
You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.
The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrongly posed.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ.
Thanks!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will closing mosques make America safer?
It might free up a few parking spots, but it won&#39;t stop the terror.
Regular attendance at a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and greater civic participation.
And as a police chief in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don&#39;t actually get radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
The radicalization process has been found to start online. First, the person is cut off from their community, even their family, so the extremist group can brainwash them into believing the terrorists are the true Muslims and anyone who detests their behavior and ideology is a traitor or apostate.
If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to encourage people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
After all, a group like IS justifies its brutality with the Koran.
As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything we can to stop a group like IS.
But we would conform to their ideas if they were accepted as representing 1.6 billion believers.
Thanks!
IS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has with Christianity.
Both groups claim their ideology is based on their &quot;Holy Book&quot;.
But if you take a look at them, they are not driven by what they read in their &quot;Scriptures&quot;.
It is their brutality that allows them to read these things into Scripture.
An eminent imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she was planning to join IS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was just the opposite. Every minister she spoke to silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of her anger, she was a prime target for instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.
This Imam reconnected with God and their community.
Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways to make real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque saved her from joining IS.
This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day, every day, affect our democracy, our freedom of thought?
One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that when we&#39;re afraid, at least three things happen.
We tend to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.
A study shows that when test subjects are presented with news reports that are negative about Muslims, they are more likely to approve of military attacks on Muslim countries and the curtailment of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.
It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.
So Islamophobia is not just the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected.
Indeed, it can be a tool for manipulating the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society with sane and well-informed citizens.
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
Assigning collective guilt is not just about having to explain yourself.
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was in dental school, talented, promising...
His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his CV. She was amazed and said:
&quot;When did my little brother become such an accomplished young man?&quot;
Just a few weeks after Suzanne visited her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, as did Yusor&#39;s sister, Razan, who was visiting that afternoon. He did it in her apartment, like an execution, after posting statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Not only can fanaticism be immoral, it can also be deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay home safely?
We discussed it and it wasn&#39;t an easy decision for us, because it was a question of what America we want to give our children: one where fear would control us, or one where we would be free to practice our religion.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the child seat, we drove to the mosque in silence, at full speed.
I took it out, took off my shoes, went into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked us and welcomed our guests, because half of those gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us but to help us.
At that moment I broke down.
These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who think: We are better than them.
Thanks very much.
Thank you very much!
Helen Walters: Well, Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.
But I&#39;m wondering, what do you say to those who might claim that you&#39;re a TEDTalk, you&#39;re a deep thinker, you work in a fancy think tank, so you&#39;re the exception rather than the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say make no mistake. I&#39;m perfectly normal.
I&#39;m no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as is allowed.
If you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest ever study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.
So I&#39;m not an exception in any way.
When people seem like an exception to the rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you. Dalia Mogahid.

Before air parcel delivery entered our societal consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-metre high tower of 1,500 bricks live in front of an audience at the FRAC Center in France. A few years ago they started flying with ropes.
By tying them together, aircraft can achieve high speed and acceleration in a confined space.
You can also independently build tensile structures.
They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to the laws of nature.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous flight.
For a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in space.
In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. This then allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today&#39;s demos we&#39;re using a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Every flying machine has internal sensors to determine its position in space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.
External commands are at the highest level. e.g. B. “take off” and “land”.
This is a so-called rear starter,
an aircraft trying to kill two birds with one stone.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters of all varieties.
Unlike most fixed-wing aircraft, it can hover, giving it great advantages in takeoff and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
A limitation of stern launchers is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as gusts of wind.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea is that no matter what the attitude, the aircraft can regain the optimal position and performance can be improved with practice.
OK.
During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that get to the heart of the matter.
An example of such a question would be: what is the minimum number of moving parts for controlled flight?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters are known, for example, as machines with a thousand moving parts that combine to hurt you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder.
We recently discovered that flying works with just one.
This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. It was recently invented.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges and ailerons, no other actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.
Though mechanically simple, a lot happens internally to allow it to fly stably and move anywhere in space.
Still, it doesn&#39;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear launcher. In order to make it fly, I have to throw it just right.
The odds of throwing it just right with everyone watching me are slim, so I&#39;ll show you a video that was filmed last night.
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine, the eight-propeller omnicopter, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this excess?
You see that it is extremely symmetrical.
Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.
This gives him the extraordinary ability
to move in space in all directions, no matter which way it is turned or even how it rotates.
Of course it&#39;s complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight propellers.
Some can be represented in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.
Let&#39;s see.
If flying machines are to be part of our everyday lives, they have to be extremely safe and reliable.
This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller flying machines.
This rotates clockwise
and the other counterclockwise.
When you put them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.
However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit with limitations.
We will now demonstrate this by making one half flightless.
The final demonstration examines synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.
We took off-the-shelf micro-quadcopters -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and loaded them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-directed. Therefore there is no upper limit.
Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
That extra safe machine over there wants to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.
For guys like us, the reward is in the development and the act of creation.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thanks very much.
1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes orbited each other faster and faster, converting the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For that brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars combined in all the galaxies in the entire known universe.
It was a very big bang.
However, they did not release their energy in the form of light --
after all, we are talking about black holes.
All of the energy was dumped into the fabric of space-time itself, and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first place the events in chronological order.
1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just emerged on Earth.
Since then, the earth has produced a lot: coral, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God help us -- even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave people -- MIT&#39;s Rai Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Caltech&#39;s Ronald Drever -- decided to build a giant laser detector to look for gravitational waves, such as those produced by colliding black holes.
Most thought she was crazy.
But enough people recognized them as mad geniuses that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, engineering, design, and extremely hard work, they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory.
In the period that followed, the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance enormously.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s now called Advanced LIGO.
At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a final test run to clear up some minor, stubborn problems.
On September 14, 2015, just days after the detector went live, gravitational waves from the two colliding black holes ripped through Earth.
They went through you and me
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:
the birth of my daughter
and saying goodbye to my terminally ill father.
Basically, these were the fruits of my life&#39;s work.
Everything I worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: This is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. He has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their signals, which can be measured by observatories such as LIGO, for 23 years. But what are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.
As the wave passes, space and all of its contents are stretched in one direction and compressed in the other.
To illustrate, teachers in relativity courses often do a really silly dance.
&quot;Stretch and compress, stretch and compress.&quot;
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
For example, on September 14th, each of us was stretched and constricted as the waves hit. The stretch of an average human was 10 to the -21 power.
That means 20 zeros after the decimal point, followed by a 1. That&#39;s why the LIGO employees were declared crazy.
With a laser detector five kilometers long, and that&#39;s absurd, this length would have to be measured to within a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. That&#39;s grotesque.
At the end of his classic text on gravitation
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the hunt for the waves as follows: &quot;The technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will surely be overcome.&quot;
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before its success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to say LIGO is more of an ear than an eye.
I want to explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.
That&#39;s pretty handy. Because this is how you can make a picture or map of things by noticing the light coming from multiple points around you.
It&#39;s different with sounds.
Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That&#39;s why it&#39;s very difficult, if not impossible, to create a picture of things that mean a lot to you:
like your child&#39;s face.
Instead, we listen for certain characteristics, such as pitch and pitch, rhythm, and volume, to infer the story behind it.
&quot;Now Alice is speaking.&quot;
&quot;And Bob interrupts her.&quot;
&quot;Silly Bob.&quot;
The same applies to gravitational waves.
We cannot use them to make simple images of objects in space.
But by listening for changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can hear their stories.
At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear space speak.
Listening to gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, for example, which my colleague Scott has been studying for a long time.
SH: Two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: whoop!
If the two bodies spin very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. It sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!
It&#39;s a kind of movement vocabulary imprinted on the waveform.
AA: On September 14, 2015 -- a date I at least will never forget -- LIGO heard the following: [Whirring noise] Someone who knows what to listen for will recognize this as the noise of -- SH: ... two black holes, each 30 times the mass of our Sun, spinning about as fast as the bars of your blender.
AA: Let&#39;s think about what that means for a moment.
Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each other a hundred times per second before colliding.
Imagine those powers.
Fantastic.
And we know about it because we&#39;ve heard it.
This is the enduring importance of LIGO.
LIGO paves a whole new way to explore space like never before.
In this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.
There is much that we cannot see -- practically or fundamentally -- in space.
A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massive stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. We learned a lot about space from them.
But the exciting physical processes take place in the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.
We will never see through as these are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. The Big Bang: I&#39;d love to explore the first few minutes of space, but we&#39;ll never see them because the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.
Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to see back to the beginning.
And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things in space that we have never seen before, that we will probably never see and of which we have no idea. Things we only discover by listening.
In fact, LIGO found things we didn&#39;t expect right on the first try.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, a key member of the LIGO project, has this to say on the subject: ME: The kind of black hole-forming stars observed by LIGO are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO gives us a completely different perspective on what is happening in space, on the formation of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as brave as possible.
Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirp of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.
After all, what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time to dream big.
Dream with us.
Thanks.
A while back I tried an experiment.
For a year, I would say &quot;Yes!&quot; to everything I feared.
Whether it made me nervous, put me in awkward situations, I forced myself to say &quot;yes.&quot;
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be on live TV?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And a crazy thing happened: doing exactly what I was afraid of removed my fear.
My fear of speaking, my social anxiety -- poof, gone.
The power of a word is impressive.
&quot;Yes&quot; changed my life.
&quot;Yes&quot; changed me.
But there was a certain yes that profoundly changed my life, in an unexpected way. It started with a question from my youngest.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. And Emerson, the smallest, inexplicably calls everyone &quot;sweetheart&quot;
like she was a southern waitress.
&quot;Honey, I need milk for my sippy cup.&quot;
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was about to go. And I said, &quot;Yes&quot;.
That yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family. From then on, I vowed to play with them whenever you asked me to. No matter what I&#39;m doing or where I&#39;m going, I always say yes -- every single time.
Nearly. I&#39;m not perfect, but I try very hard.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has an amazing side effect: Only recently did I actually fully understand that saying &quot;yes&quot; to playing with my kids saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I am an author. I make things up, bring them to life.
dream job.
No.
i am a titan
dream job.
I create television. I produce television.
I do television, big time.
This TV season, I&#39;m responsible for bringing 70 hours of programming out into the world.
Four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. Three to four shows are in production at the same time.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that didn&#39;t exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television network can range from three to six million dollars.
Let&#39;s say five.
One new episode every nine days times four shows, so every nine days $20 million TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at the same time times four, 16 episodes at a time: 24 episodes: Grey&#39;s, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 Episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 Episodes: The Catch, 70 Hours of TV,
$350 million for one season.
In America, my TV series run back-to-back on Thursday nights.
All over the world, my series are shown in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 hours of TV are shows that I&#39;ve created myself, not just produced, that&#39;s good. I need to find time, really quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four TV series, 70 hours of TV, three, sometimes four, shows in production at the same time, $350 million, campfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else does this?
Nobody, that&#39;s why I&#39;m a titan.
dream job.
I don&#39;t want to impress you with this.
I say it because I know what you think when you hear the word &quot;author&quot;.
I&#39;m telling you this so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country, a classroom, a business, or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so you&#39;ll understand that I I don&#39;t just type and fantasize on the computer, and it&#39;s true when I say: I understand that a dream job isn&#39;t about dreaming.
It&#39;s all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard and I love it.
When I&#39;m engrossed in the work, there&#39;s no other feeling.
My work always creates a land out of nothing.
It&#39;s like raising troops, like painting on a canvas.
Like hitting a high note, running a marathon.
You feel like Beyoncé.
And all this at the same time.
i love to work
She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and exhilarating, funny and disturbing, clinical and motherly, cruel and sane. And the best part is the buzz.
There&#39;s such a change in me when work is going well.
A buzz starts in my head and it grows and grows and the buzz sounds like a busy street I could ride forever.
A lot of people, when I explain the hum to them that I&#39;m talking about writing, assume that I enjoy writing.
Don&#39;t get me wrong, she does.
But the buzz -- when I started producing television, when I started working and working and making, building, creating and collaborating, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. The buzz!
The hum is more than the writing.
The hum is action and activity. The buzz is a drug.
The hum is music. The hum is light and air.
The buzzing is God&#39;s voice in my ear.
And if you have such a buzz, then you can&#39;t help but strive for greatness.
Feeling like you can&#39;t help but strive for greatness, no matter the cost.
That&#39;s called the buzz.
Or maybe it means being a workaholic.
Maybe it&#39;s called genius.
Maybe it&#39;s called ego.
Maybe it&#39;s the fear of failure.
I don&#39;t know it.
All I know is that I&#39;m not made to fail, and all I know is that I love the buzz.
I just want to tell you I&#39;m a titan and I know I don&#39;t want to question it.
To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more programs, the more episodes, the more boundaries overcome, the more work there is, the more things are happening at the same time, the more people are watching me, the more I make history, the more expectations there are it.
The harder I work to be successful, the harder I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work don&#39;t I?
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum.
I like that buzz. I love the hum.
I need the buzz I am the buzz
Am I just this buzz?
And then the hum stopped.
Overworked, overused, overdone, burnt out.
The hum stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a total working titan.
Harper tells people, &quot;My mom won&#39;t be there, but you can text my nanny.&quot;
And Emerson says, &quot;Honey, I want to go to Shonda country.&quot;
They are the children of a titan.
They are baby titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The hum of the engine stopped.
I didn&#39;t love my job anymore. The engine was off.
The buzz didn&#39;t come back.
My hum was broken.
I was doing the same things I always do: same titan work, 15 hour days, work through weekends, no regrets, don&#39;t delegate anything, a titan doesn&#39;t sleep, doesn&#39;t give up, wholehearted, clear-eyed, whatever.
But there was no buzz.
There was silence inside me.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titan.
I was a model titan
Everything was grey, I just wasn&#39;t having fun anymore.
And that was my life.
everything i did
I was the buzz and the buzz was me.
So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades away?
I know some might be thinking, &quot;Cry yourself, stupid author titan.&quot;
But you know you do, you do, you work, you love what you do, to be a teacher, to be a banker, to be a mother, to be a painter, to be Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you get the hum when you know the hum and know what the hum feels like when you&#39;ve known the hum before, when the hum stops, who are you?
What are you?
What am I?
Am I still a titan?
When my heart&#39;s song stops, can I survive in silence?
And then my &quot;Southern waitress&quot; asks me a question.
I&#39;m on my way out late and she says, &quot;Mom, do you like to play?&quot;
And I&#39;m about to say no when I realize two things:
Firstly, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn&#39;t call me &quot;sweetie&quot;.
She doesn&#39;t call anyone &quot;sweetie&quot; anymore.
When did that happen?
I miss it when I&#39;m Titan mourning my buzz, and this is where it all changes before my very eyes.
And so she says, &quot;Mom, do you like to play?&quot;
And I say, &quot;Yes&quot;.
There&#39;s nothing special about that.
We play and her sisters join in, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book Everybody Poops.
Nothing special.
But it&#39;s outstanding because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and lack of buzz, there&#39;s nothing I can do but pay attention.
i am focused
I am quiet.
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high note - they no longer exist.
All that exists is sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, crayons and that song about letting go, or whatever the girl in Frozen lets go.
Everywhere is peace and simplicity.
The air in this place is so scarce I can hardly breathe.
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m breathing.
Play is the opposite of work.
And I am happy.
Something in me dissolves.
A mental door opens and a burst of energy comes in.
And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The hum is slowly coming back.
Not full volume, barely there, it&#39;s quiet, barely audible, but it&#39;s there.
Not the buzz, but a buzz.
And now I feel like I know a magical secret.
But let&#39;s stick to the point.
It is love. That&#39;s all.
no magic No secret. only love
It&#39;s something we forgot.
The hum, the working hum, the titan hum, that&#39;s just the substitute.
When I ask who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself through shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is, I&#39;ve forgotten what the real buzz is.
The buzz is not a power and it is not work specific.
It depends on joy.
The real buzz depends on love.
The hum is the flow that comes from the lust for life.
The real buzz is confidence and peace.
The real buzz ignores the pressure of the story, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.
The real buzz is simple and original.
The real hum is God&#39;s voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words to me, because what god told me I was a titan?
It&#39;s just love
We all need a little more love, a lot more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I make this a firm rule so that, as a workaholic, I can rid myself of any guilt.
It&#39;s the law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the hum again.
I wish it was so simple. I&#39;m not good at gaming, I don&#39;t like it.
I don&#39;t like playing as much as working.
The truth hurts,
but i don&#39;t like to play.
I always work because I love it.
I&#39;d rather be at work than at home.
This admission is painful, because what kind of person would rather be at work than at home?
Well, me.
Honestly, I call myself &quot;Titan&quot; --
I must have problems
Being too relaxed is not one of them.
We race around the garden, back and forth, back and forth.
We do little dance parties
we sing and play ball.
We burst soap bubbles.
Most of the time I feel stiff, absent and confused.
I always reach for my cell phone.
But it&#39;s okay
My children teach me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I ask myself why did we ever stop playing?
You can too! Always say yes when your child wants to play with you.
Maybe you think I&#39;m naive, a daydreamer.
You&#39;re probably right about that, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You&#39;re not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It&#39;s only 15 minutes.
My little ones don&#39;t want to play with me for more than 15 minutes before they realize they want to do something else.
It&#39;s a wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for a full 15 minutes, I&#39;m mom of the year.
It&#39;s only 15 minutes, that&#39;s all it takes.
Anyone can muster 15 minutes at a time, even on a bad mood day!
15 minutes straight!
No cell phone, no laundry, no distractions.
The day is short: dinners that get kids ready for bed.
But 15 minutes are in it!
My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. It doesn&#39;t have to be the kids. It&#39;s about feeling the buzz, having a place for your peace of mind.
It&#39;s not about playing with your own children. it&#39;s about joy
about &quot;gaming&quot; in general.
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what is good for you.
Find out and keep it.
I&#39;m not perfect at it. I fail and I win. Meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --
&quot;Do you want to play?&quot; is shorthand for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a titan in training, when I wanted more and more to surpass myself.
15 minutes straight, why not treat yourself to a full 15 minutes?
What can be wrong with that? Nothing!
The buzz came back in my spare time. The buzz then seems to return when I&#39;m not working.
Working doesn&#39;t work without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in, and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. She inspires me to new ideas. The hum has made its way again. I use it to the fullest and love my work again.
I like the buzz but I don&#39;t love it.
I do not need it.
I&#39;m not the buzz, the buzz isn&#39;t me... not anymore.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
This is my hum now.
The buzz of life.
The hum of love.
The hum of work is part of me, but just a part. And I&#39;m so thankful for that.
I don&#39;t give a damn that I&#39;m a titan. I&#39;ve never seen a Titan play Journey to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more play.
And yet I have everything under control. My brain is still functional. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my kids are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my head is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the hum. The country I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the screens, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other, the right hum: the hum of life.
The more I feel this buzzing, the more this unusual, trembling, naked and new attitude to life spreads in me. Less titanium -- more me!
The more I feel that exact buzz, the more I know who I am.
I am an author. I make things up, I bring them to life.
It&#39;s part of the job, it means living your dream.
This is the dream of this job
because a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more play.
Titans don&#39;t stand a chance here.
&quot;Wanna play?&quot;
Thank you very much.
I&#39;m a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedy every day.
I know how your life can change in a second, after a massive stroke or after a car accident.
It is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.
After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.
That&#39;s probably why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor trying to improve nerve function through various surgical procedures.
Surely you&#39;ve heard of one of the most well-known, &quot;deep brain stimulation&quot;. It involves implanting an electrode deep in the brain to affect the circuitry of the neurons in a way that improves neurological function.
It really is amazing technology. She has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson&#39;s who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.
However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.
In my opinion, we are getting closer to that dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With a little help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At the time, I was the senior attending and worked day and night in the emergency room.
I often cared for patients with craniocerebral trauma.
You have to imagine that with craniocerebral trauma the brain swells and the intracranial pressure increases.
In order to save life, one must reduce the intracranial pressure.
This sometimes requires removing part of the swollen brain matter.
Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with one of my colleagues, Jean-François Brunet, who is a biologist.
What do I mean?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is like having very young children taken out of their families.
You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity, and the environments to keep them thriving.
That&#39;s what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.
He saw that under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. With large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.
You may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any type of cell in the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep little niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain matter in the operating room.
We made another fascinating observation: Normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They slowly divided and even died after a few weeks.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin positive cells.
We all have them in our brain.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
In the fetal stage, they take care of the folding of the brain.
But why do they stay with us?
We do not know that.
We believe they are involved in brain healing as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.
However, that is not so certain.
One thing is clear though -- from these cells we got our stem cells.
We are faced with a potential source of cells that enable brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to design an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of non-linguistic brain matter and then culture the cells exactly as Jean-François did
and then color-code them to track them in the brain.
In the final step, we reimplanted them at the donor site of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen if we reimplant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we re-implanted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared, as if they had been removed, they go back home. The room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they leave.
In the second scenario, we inflicted an injury and reimplanted the exact same cells, and now the cells stayed -- they grew into mature neurons.
Here you can see what we observed under the microscope.
These are the cells that have been reimplanted.
The proof they show is these little dots. These are the cells that we stained in vitro, in culture.
Of course we couldn&#39;t stop there.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.
They had to take feed pellets from a tray.
They did very well.
When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the hand motor area in the motor cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed and could no longer move their hands.
Just as would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke.
The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to some degree, just like the monkey.
Once we were certain that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left you can see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.
He can perform about 40% to 50% of his original performance before the injury.
It&#39;s not as precise and not as fast.
Now look when we reimplanted the cells: The same monkey, two months after the reimplantation.
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too.
Since that time we have found out a great deal more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson&#39;s.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I really hope that soon I can show you how the human brain gives us the tools to heal itself.
Thanks very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that&#39;s wonderful, I&#39;m sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, are thinking: &quot;I know someone who could use that.&quot;
I definitely do.
Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start human clinical trials.
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Based on these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.
BG: That&#39;s understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.
BG: Looking ahead -- you&#39;ve completed the research and are trying to get permission to start clinical trials. If you look further into the future, how many years will it be before someone can get into the hospital and this therapy will be available.
JB: That&#39;s hard to say.
First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the authorities allow us to launch it soon?
Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to select the patients to do the treatments and to evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment.
Then you have to apply that to a multicenter study.
You really have to show that it&#39;s useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.
BG: And that it&#39;s safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and for telling us about it.
BG: Thank you.
Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake in taking them for granted.
We see democracy not as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society.
We tend to think of them as an unchanging fact.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That&#39;s not true.
Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proven beyond a doubt that it is entirely possible to have thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain utterly undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is dwindling here, in Europe.
Earlier this year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- as finance minister in the Eurogroup, it was made very clear to me that our country&#39;s democratic process -- our elections -- must not affect the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece .
At that moment, I thought that there couldn&#39;t be a better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that if democracy changed anything, it would be abolished.
At this point I would like to present you with an economic model for a real democracy.
I ask you to join me in believing again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and even the Eurogroup are mistaken in believing that we can save on democracy and that we need a real and resilient democracy.
Because without democracy, our societies will be meaner, our futures bleak, and our great new technologies wasted.
On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies.
I call it the &quot;twin peaks paradox&quot;.
You know one peak. They know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt
but few recognize his twin.
A mountain of idle cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations who are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and generate income that would pay off the debt and also produce all the things that the Mankind urgently needs, for example, &quot;green&quot; energy.
I&#39;ll give you two numbers.
In the past 3 months in the US, UK and the Eurozone a total of $3.4 trillion has been invested in all the wealth producing commodities such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railroad tracks, equipment and so on and so on.
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion that was lying around in those same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, doing absolutely nothing but inflating stock markets and house prices to blow up
In this way, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that cannot be balanced out by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequent low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending loop is fueling pessimism among investors who, fearing low demand, promote them themselves by not investing in them. Just like Oedipus&#39; father who, afraid the oracle&#39;s prophecy might come true, that his son would kill him when he grew up,
unintentionally creating the circumstances that lead to Oedipus killing him.
This is my struggle with capitalism --
its exceedingly wasteful ways. All that unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to fund all the technologies, &quot;green&quot; technologies, that are crucial to saving the earth.
So is democracy the solution?
I think so. But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.
Athenian democracy, of course, excluded too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to downplay Athenian democracy because of these exclusions.
The essence of Athenian democracy was and is that it included the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and crucially, it gave them the right to political participation with equal voting weight in matters of state affairs .
Athenian democracy didn&#39;t last long --
like a candle that shines very brightly, it also burns out quickly.
However, our contemporary liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,
but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and empowered the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a charter for rulers.
Liberal democracy only emerged when politics and business could be completely separated and the democratic process was limited to politics, while business -- that is, the corporate world -- became a democracy-free zone.
In today&#39;s democracies, from the moment this separation of politics and business began, there has been an unrelenting struggle between the two, with business gradually subverting and disempowering politics.
Do you wonder why politicians aren&#39;t the way they used to be?
It&#39;s not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
It&#39;s because nowadays you can be in government and still not in power because power has migrated from politics to economics and the spheres are separate.
I mentioned my struggles with capitalism.
If you think about it, it&#39;s a bit like a herd of predators that have decimated the animals they feed on so badly that they end up starving to death because of it.
It is similar with the economy, which has cannibalized politics to the point that it is harming itself through the self-inflicted economic crisis. Corporate power is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling, and corporate executives are too scared to invest their company&#39;s cash.
The more successfully capitalism expels the &quot;demos&quot; [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks become, and the greater the waste of human labor and of mankind&#39;s wealth.
If that&#39;s true, it&#39;s obvious that we need to bring politics and economics back together, and it would be better if the &quot;demos&quot; remained in control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women, and the Foreigner.
By the way, this is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn&#39;t end well.
The lesson of the Soviet Union debacle was to be that, without creating new forms of brutality and waste, the working poor would miraculously regain a position like that of ancient Athens.
But there is a solution: Abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem with this is that as long as economics and politics are separate domains, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste loftier, and the social conflicts deeper, just like -- very soon, I think -- in countries like China will come.
So we need to reshape the economy and reunite the realms of economics and politics, while being careful to democratize the reunited realm, or else we&#39;ll end up in a morbid surveillance hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix feel like a documentary.
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological advances it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be replaced by a dystopia akin to that of The Matrix, or something akin to the society of Star Trek, where machines serve humans and humans invest their energies in the exploration of the universe, or indulge in lengthy conversations about the meaning of life in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian &quot;Agora&quot;.
I think we can be optimistic.
So what would it take, what might it look like to have this &quot;Star Trek&quot;-like utopia instead of the &quot;Matrix&quot;-like dystopia?
In terms of practical implementation, I would like to briefly give you a few examples.
In the corporate realm, please imagine a capital market where you make money while you work and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- whichever one you are in currently working -- owned by those currently working at the company.
Then all income comes from capital and from proceeds, and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete.
No more differentiation between those who own the companies but don&#39;t work in them and employees who work there but don&#39;t own the company. No more tug-of-war between capital and labor, no more large gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no soaring twin peaks.
In the realm of global political economy: Please briefly imagine that our national currencies had a floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency managed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], is issued in the interest of all mankind.
Imagine further that all world trade is traded in this currency -- let&#39;s call it &#39;the cosmos&#39;, in units of &#39;cosmos&#39; -- and each government pays the sum equal to that country&#39;s trade deficit or trade surplus corresponds to a common fund.
Also, imagine this fund investing in &quot;green&quot; technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
The problem was that you didn&#39;t have the technical means to implement it at the time.
Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy.
The world I am describing to you is at once libertarian, in which it favors privileged individuals, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.
But above all else, it&#39;s a world in which we can imagine real democracy.
Will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot;Matrix&quot;-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we decide together politically.
It&#39;s in our hands, and we better do it democratically.
Thanks.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis...
In your biography you describe yourself as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx&#39;s analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunion of politics and economics is... If we don&#39;t do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand that Larry Summers calls &quot;long-term stagnation&quot;.
By spreading this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are now experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also those countries that have little interest in liberal democracy.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,
like Hayek, that&#39;s why I&#39;m a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m completely insane.
BG: Indeed, and now we probably are too.
YV: If you&#39;re not confused, you&#39;re not thinking enough.
BG: That&#39;s a very Greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers&#39; dinner you were very clear about what you think of the Western view of China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: There is a great deal of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.
As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it happens -- the economic area -- is a completely non-democratic zone.
In a way, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles 19th-century England.
Because -- remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that&#39;s a mistake, historically speaking.
Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skeptical about democratic development.
What you see in China now is very similar to what we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
Blaming China now for doing what the West itself did in the 19th century smacks of hypocrisy.
BG: I&#39;m sure many listeners are curious about your experience as Greece&#39;s finance minister earlier this year.
YV: I knew it was coming.
BG: Yeah...
How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?
YV: Very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a fresh start with the eurozone,
not only Greece, but the Eurozone,
namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and constant denial that a massive fault line ran and continues to run through the eurozone, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union.
We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --
to do it right Unfortunately, the powers that be within the Eurozone, within the Eurogroup, have continued to choose denial.
But you know what&#39;s coming.
This is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to sustain an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when change does occur, it will be abrupt and destructive.
BG: What changes do you foresee?
YV: There is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.
BG: Have you made any mistakes in your time as finance minister?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone looking back -- Seriously...
If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was signing the debt program extension motion in late February.
I believed that there was a genuine interest on the part of the donors in finding a common solution.
But there wasn&#39;t.
They just wanted to bring down our government just because they didn&#39;t want to deal with the dislocations running through the Eurozone.
They didn&#39;t want to admit that they had been running a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
It&#39;s worse than during the &quot;Great Depression&quot;.
None of the troika of donors who imposed this policy on us admitted: &quot;That was a colossal mistake.&quot;
BG: Despite all that, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you still seem quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.
My biggest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.
Because if it doesn&#39;t survive, the centrifugal forces released will be demonic and will destroy the European Union.
This will not only have catastrophic consequences for Europe, but for the entire global economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a postmodern 1930, as it seems to me, it will be just as detrimental to the future of Europeans as non-Europeans.
BG: We sincerely hope that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you for being at TED.
YV: Thank you.
Roy Price is something most have never heard of, despite the fact that he is likely responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Probably a very entertaining 22 minutes too, but not for very many of you.
This goes back to the decision Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is an executive at Amazon Studios,
Amazon&#39;s TV production company.
He&#39;s 47, slim, with a spiky hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as &quot;movies, TV, tech, tacos.&quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very competitive industry.
There are already so many TV series that Roy can&#39;t pick just one.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he needs to find shows that are on the far right of that curve.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. The rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows received that rating.
If your show scores a nine or higher, it&#39;s a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
It&#39;s shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Wire -- all the addicting shows where after you&#39;ve watched a season your brain is like, &quot;Where are there more of these episodes ?&quot;
That kind of show.
On the left, here at this end, are shows like &quot;Toddlers and Tiaras&quot; -- -- that should tell you enough about what&#39;s going on at this end of the curve.
Roy Price doesn&#39;t worry about going to the left of the curve because I think it takes a lot of intelligence to undercut &quot;Toddlers and Tiaras&quot;.
He&#39;s more concerned with the mean bulge, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don&#39;t excite.
So he needs to make sure he&#39;s really on the right page.
The pressure is there, and of course it&#39;s Amazon&#39;s first time doing something like this, so Roy Price doesn&#39;t want to take any chances.
He wants to create success.
He needs guaranteed success, so he&#39;s holding a competition.
He takes many TV show ideas and selects eight TV show candidates through evaluation, then produces the first episode of each of those shows and puts them online for anyone to watch for free.
And when Amazon gives stuff away for free, you grab it, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they don&#39;t know that they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are being watched by Roy and his team, who are recording everything.
They record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip and watch again.
They collect millions of pieces of data and then use that data to decide which show to produce.
Indeed, they collect the data, they process it, and from that comes the answer, and that is, &quot;Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators.&quot;
They made this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, &quot;Alpha House&quot;, but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn&#39;t that good.
It&#39;s just an average show -- literally -- since the average of that curve is 7.4 and Alpha House comes in at 7.5 -- a little above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards .
At about the same time at another company, another manager placed a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, Netflix&#39;s programming manager. Just like Roy, he&#39;s always on a quest to find that one super show, and he uses data to do that, but he does it a little differently.
Instead of running a competition, he and his team looked at existing data on Netflix viewership -- the ratings they give the shows, their history, what shows they like, etc.
Then they use that data to find out these little details about viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
Once they had all the pieces together, they took a gamble and decided to make a drama series about one senator rather than a sitcom about four senators.
Do you know this show?
Yes, House of Cards. Netflix landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.
&quot;House of Cards&quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this chart. So exactly where they wanted to be.
Of course, the question now is: What happened here?
You have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
They connect all this data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.
Why is that?
Because logic kinda says it should work for everything.
If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, then you should be able to make a good decision.
You have 200 years of statistics as a backup.
It is optimized by very powerful computers.
The least you can expect is good TV, right?
When data analysis doesn&#39;t work that way, it&#39;s a bit scary, because we live in a time where we&#39;re turning more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, well beyond television.
Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
No one. Ok, that&#39;s actually good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with that software. If you touch it, you&#39;re in prison.
If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for a release, it is likely that this company&#39;s data analysis will be used to determine whether or not they will be released.
Just like Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it&#39;s deciding if a person will be good or bad.
Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison is worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the large amount of data
doesn&#39;t always produce the best results. It&#39;s not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn&#39;t know how to use data.
Even the most data-savvy companies are sometimes wrong.
Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.
In 2009, Google announced that they could predict outbreaks of influenza, the bad kind, through data analysis -- through data analysis of Google searches.
It worked beautifully and was a huge news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the magazine &quot;Nature&quot;.
It worked flawlessly, year after year after year, until suddenly it stopped working,
and no one could say why.
It just didn&#39;t work, this again caused a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine &quot;Nature&quot;.
Even the most data-savvy companies like Amazon and Google sometimes get it wrong.
Despite all these flaws, data is increasingly flowing into life&#39;s decisions -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we&#39;d better make sure data is helpful.
I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computational genetics -- an area where some very smart people use an unimaginable amount of data to make serious decisions, like deciding on cancer therapy
or the development of a drug. Over the years I&#39;ve seen some patterns in the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. This pattern should be spread.
If you ever need to solve a complex problem, do two main things:
First, break this problem down into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; second, put the pieces back together to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this multiple times, but it&#39;s always two things: take apart and put back together.
And now the most important thing: Data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dissect a problem and understand its parts.
You are not suited to putting the pieces back together and then coming to a conclusion.
There is another tool for that and we all have it: our brain.
If there&#39;s one thing the brain is good at, it&#39;s putting pieces and pieces back together even when the information is incomplete and then making a good decision -- especially when it&#39;s an expert&#39;s brain.
That&#39;s why I think Netflix has been so successful, because they&#39;ve used data and reason where they belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise would not have been able to do. But deciding how to take all those pieces, put them back together, and make a show like House of Cards out of it, that wasn&#39;t in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made that decision for this show, which meant they took a huge personal risk with that decision.
Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.
They used data to drive all of their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they chose &quot;Alpha House&quot; as their show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say, &quot;That&#39;s what the data tells us.&quot;
It didn&#39;t lead to the desired result.
Data is helpful for making better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data starts driving our decisions.
No matter how powerful it is, data is just a tool and not to forget, this device is pretty useful.
Many of you will...
Before there was data, this was the decision-making device.
Many know it.
It is also called &quot;Magic 8 Ball&quot;. It is amazing. For decisions using a yes or no question, all you have to do is shake the ball to get an answer. &quot;Most likely&quot; -- right here, at this very moment.
I&#39;ll fight it out with a tech demo later.
I&#39;ve made quite a few decisions in my life so far that, in hindsight, I should have listened to the ball.
But, of course, as you know, once you have the data available you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So maybe the ball gets smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it&#39;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right-hand corner.
And I find this to be very encouraging news that despite the vast amount of data, it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert at what you do, and to take risks.
Because in the end, it&#39;s not the data, it&#39;s the risks that get you on the right end of the curve.
Thank you very much.
